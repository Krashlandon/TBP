WEBVTT

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.430
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.720
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.810
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.940
Press pass this!

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.320
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.870
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.800
Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
Yeah, man, speed up.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.060
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.690
Holy shit!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.980
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.530
You fucking assholes!

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.620
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.210
Yeehaw!

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.090
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.550
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.890
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.940
- Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.200
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.410
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.040
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.460
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.730
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.190
Hey, guys! Guys!

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.540
We forgot the beer!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.280
No!

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.820
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.710
Can I help you?

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.430
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.310
Beer's in the back.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.580
You see the way them kids looked?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.260
Read that list back to me.
OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.560
hacksaw, baling hooks,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.110
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.950
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.540
- "crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.870
- lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.370
Hand drill...

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.220
_.feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.850
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.320
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.920
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.730
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.900
There's nothing so special about them.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.280
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.920
You know something, Dale?

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.410
She's just human. Why don't you
go over there and talk to her?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.840
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.140
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation home.
That'll probably impress her.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.850
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.320
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.530
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.500
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.960
more or less.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.340
You got a damn good heart.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.970
Yup.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.520
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560
What's the worst that could happen?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.610
You know something?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.660
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.080
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.590
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.170
It shows confidence.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.430
Smile and laugh. OK.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.480
- Do it.
- All right.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.190
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.540
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.370
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.870
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.800
Get in the truck.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.470
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.490
I told you, Tucker.
I'm a zero with the ladies.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.750
They hate my face!

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.680
Come on.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.580
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the ladyfolk the way you can.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.110
No one can. I mean, I...

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.290
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.050
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.640
No, I don't.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.350
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.690
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.070
Mm-hm.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.490
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.160
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.660
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.250
Oh, I got you.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.510
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.510
All right, he's pulling over.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.730
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.430
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.820
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.450
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.290
He's out of his car?
He's coming.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.070
- Tucker!
- Get it...

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.300
Yeah.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.440
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.520
License, please.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.410
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.530
Temporary.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.210
Where you two headed?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.510
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.560
I sank every penny I had into it.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.110
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix
'er up, maybe do a little fishin'.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.070
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.990
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:44.920
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.650
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.360
Oh, yes, sir.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.200
See that you, uh...

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.780
get that fixed.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.790
That was very helpful.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.560
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.850
There he goes.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.020
Bye _

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.780
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.790
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.090
Ah. Well...

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.590
Here's to the good life, huh?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.970
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.090
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.930
I know, I know.
Is that ours?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.930
Wow. And another one right there.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.220
Oh, my God.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.430
It's perfect!

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.320
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.200
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.460
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.720
- Well, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.760
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.560
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.760
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:12.840
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.130
- All right.
- Score!

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.140
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.900
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.490
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.740
You know something?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.160
Dreams really do come true.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.460
Look out!

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.880
- Whoa!
- Well, I guess we should fix that.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.170
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.730
You can get off me now.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.320
If you have a reoccurring dream about sucking
a dick but never do it, are you gay?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.900
- Yes.
- Really?

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.120
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.630
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.910
No!
Chuck, no.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.800
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.890
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.110
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.490
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.960
It was 20 years ago today.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.720
The Memorial Day Massacre.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.200
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.940
they came out here to have a good time...

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:41.710
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.590
Pump Up The Jam)

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.260
Pump it up
While your feet are stompin'.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.270
And the jam is pumpin'...

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.650
J' Pump it up a little more.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.150
J* Get the party going on the dance Hoof.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.660
J' See, cos that's where the...

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.080
Get another one! Come on!

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.920
J' I'm gonna meet my maker.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.590
J' I ain't afraid to die.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.970
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.280
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.570
Only one person lived to tell this story.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.110
The rest of them just disappeared...

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.330
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.090
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.220
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.770
- I do.
- Yeah.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.150
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.300
Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.140
You take that. That's yours.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.810
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.560
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.400
Do not even think about it.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.900
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.120
- OW!
- Are you serious?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.130
What'd I just say?

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.840
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.510
That was the last thing I said.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.820
Hello?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.330
Is someone there?

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.330
Guys?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.500
Yargh!

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.430
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.480
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.980
No, it wasn't.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.530
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.490
You totally freaked me out.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.450
You know, you can drop the act now.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.510
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.880
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.100
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.900
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.190
You and I, Allie...

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.910
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.040
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.880
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.740
Chad, you're drunk.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.190
That's a good thing.
It lowers my inhibitions.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.280
OK, uh...

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.630
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.370
Why? Why stop?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.090
We're perfect for each other.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.850
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.940
Come on, Allie. Come on...

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.280
Oh, it's so cold!
Here we go!

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.130
What's that all about?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.960
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.180
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.100
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.860
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.530
What the hell are you doing?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.710
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.300
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.180
- OK.
- Hush.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.680
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.230
Look.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.620
Oh.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.170
- Tucker!
- Shush!

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.430
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.100
Me? What did I do?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.400
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.870
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.580
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.680
She didn't come up yet.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.270
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.440
Hey! Lady?

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.280
Hey, lady!

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.200
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.970
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.260
Get her legs!

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.850
Oh! No!

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.850
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.490
They got Allison! Come on!

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.620
Hey!

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.540
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.420
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.060
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.520
Shit.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.270
Chad! Chad!

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.490
The hillbillies...

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.740
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.710
They captured Allison!

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.890
Allie!

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.550
Oh, God! No.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.850
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.270
Please don't cut me open!

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.820
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.910
Doesn't like pancakes.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.290
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.840
Pa... Pancakes?

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.100
Allison!

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.310
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.020
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.060
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.530
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one of the guys was...

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.500
like...eating her face off.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.550
That is so disgusting.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.710
Not to sound too clichÃ©,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.390
And just leave Allison with them?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.390
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.770
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.900
What if I go? It's my dad's truck.
He told me I was the only one allowed to drive it.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.820
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.790
OK, awesome.
I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.250
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.400
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.330
What is this place?

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.830
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.970
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.970
All right. Maybe I will.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.810
I said maybe.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.900
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.580
Wha-What am I doing here?

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.880
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.550
Well, me and Tucker...

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.890
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640
Well...

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.480
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.410
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.370
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.870
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.380
I dove in and rescued you.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.980
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.230
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.980
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.950
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.490
Where are my friends?

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.620
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.970
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.180
Some people just aren't
any good in a crisis,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.100
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.940
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.950
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.870
it's OK, I...

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.330
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.750
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.440
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.610
You can just pet him round the nose.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.780
- He's drooling.
- I know.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.830
Anyway, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.960
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.550
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.260
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.980
But, uh...anyway...

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.900
you should relax and rest, OK?

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.450
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.160
Uh...

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.090
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.550
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.760
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.810
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.030
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.030
I'll be right in the little room here.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.370
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.580
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.210
Do you like board games?

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.270
What kind do you have?

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.770
We got this one right here.
It's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.660
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.500
No way, dude. You lost.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.340
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.610
Goddamn Romeo.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.700
Oh, well.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.330
Oh, Jesus.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.110
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.400
Run! Run for your lives!

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.790
Yargh!

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.020
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.650
One, two, three, four, five.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.400
OK, shoot.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.210
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.090
Oh, that's too easy.
That's James Monroe.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.760
God, you are right again.
You are killing me.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.010
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.020
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.730
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.160
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.290
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.090
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.480
Yeah?

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.230
So, um, what is it that
you study in college?

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.490
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.910
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.500
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.590
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.010
I-I have these stupid dreams.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.650
Dreams are not stupid.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:18.320
Well, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.660
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.790
- Yeah.
- And I just...

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.210
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.750
No, don't! Don't!

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.850
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.190
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.070
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.610
Hey, hey.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.240
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.580
I sawed into a bees' nest.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.960
Why?

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.710
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.760
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.980
Yeah.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.700
We came out here to work...

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.160
not sit around playing stupid board games!

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.120
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.710
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.430
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.350
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.730
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.650
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.570
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.780
Hi.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.540
I saw your friend out there.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.510
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.390
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.100
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.410
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.830
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.370
Ain't that right, Tucker?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.720
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.060
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.360
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.860
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anyway.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.990
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.050
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.980
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.240
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.670
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.350
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.050
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.440
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.400
Survival of the fittest!

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.710
What are you doing, man?

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.080
That's my whole face.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.540
You have serious issues, you know that?

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.350
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.970
And the answer was, "isosceles triangle".
You know what that is?

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.020
Is it a triangle?
Yeah.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.190
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.740
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.490
- Dale.
- Yeah?

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.340
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.000
I know. You keep telling me that.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.510
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish her
off real quick then we'll get back to work.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.640
They're gonna kill her!

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.900
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.820
College kids!

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.800
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.380
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.680
College kids!

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.260
I don't see 'em.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.230
They must have run off.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.740
Well, hmm... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.030
All right. With what?

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.130
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:05.800
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.970
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.940
Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.230
You think that girl is hot...

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.660
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.920
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.670
Whoa.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.090
- What?
- Huh? What?

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.770
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.980
They should be by here any minute.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.980
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.160
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.910
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.630
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.010
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.640
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.390
Oh.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.570
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.990
That's a good rule.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.580
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.670
Yeah.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.140
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.730
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.070
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.130
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.850
We don't have much time.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.440
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.490
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.670
I'm gonna just chill right here.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.760
OK, one more load and we're done.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.180
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.190
Now!

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.400
Huh?

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.370
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.960
Dale!

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.730
Oh, God!

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.310
Are you OK?

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.820
Allison, say something!

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.200
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.410
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.920
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.470
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.980
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.490
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.240
What the hell happened to her?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.370
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.250
Is that your blood?
What? No.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.630
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.050
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.010
- Holy crap.
- I know!

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.300
Calm down. Don't cry.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.390
- Calm down!
- OK.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.810
Get a hold of yourself!

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.610
All right...
I know what this is.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.670
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.760
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.630
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.310
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all of the sharp objects!

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.360
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.350
Yeah. Think about it.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.320
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.960
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.300
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.220
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.810
OK, so what... what do we...

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.230
We go to the police?

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.020
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.870
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.150
That's a good idea, Dale.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.460
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.840
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.220
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.010
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.230
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:17.490
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.660
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.500
So what the hell do we do?

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.800
We gotta clean this mess up.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.090
- Right now.
- OK.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.100
You shouldn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.190
It's not good for you.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.240
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.160
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.830
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.680
How are we gonna get outta here?

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.170
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.680
Well, then let's walk.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.930
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.850
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.240
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.040
We never should've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.110
Chad!

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.170
You guys are all a bunch of
fucking pussies, you know that?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.140
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.390
and everyone just freaks out.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.860
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.910
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:27.960
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.300
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.850
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.400
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.790
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.040
maybe you deserve to die.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.170
That's fucked up.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.060
Shh. Y'all hear that?

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.810
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.440
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.740
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.790
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.920
Fuck.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.520
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.070
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.820
Oh, God! Look out!

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.070
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.370
They're dead!

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.830
They died!

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.670
Slow down, now.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.960
- They killed them!
- OK.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.890
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb
in the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.700
Those stupid fucks.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:56.130
I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.430
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:04.430
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.240
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.450
- OK.
- All right?

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.580
One. Two. Three!

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.000
Argh!

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.000
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.260
Get it off me. Not on the face!

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.140
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.400
You're OK, you're OK.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.240
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.490
Get him over to the truck.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.250
Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.500
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.980
Oh, shit.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.110
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.870
You kids stay put.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.880
I'll handle this.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.850
Hey.
Hello, Officer.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.890
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.610
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.160
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.450
- minding our own business...
- Yup.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.510
- making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.760
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.600
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.150
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.480
the woody right back there.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:40.620
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.870
Straight through.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.800
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.300
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.280
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.960
- No...
- Oh, no.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.340
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.760
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:15.190
- What?
- You say you were just working,

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:21.410
when this...kid...ran up and stuffed
his head into that wood chipper?

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.500
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:29.380
And I think maybe they might be trying
to kill the girl that we have inside.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.880
- What girl?
- You know what?

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.350
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.310
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.820
- That's...
- On accident.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.950
On accident.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.290
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.420
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.550
You better show me what you done with her.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.770
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.400
Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.950
Wait, where is he going?

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.700
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.840
What's he doing?

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.430
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.620
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.460
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.880
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:38.310
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.440
but you'd be lucky to get that.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.690
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.750
Well, it's...
it's hard to say.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500
Looks can be deceiving.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.920
Oh, don't!

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.520
Sheriff! You OK?

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.560
Oh, shit!

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.280
Come on!
What is going on?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.620
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.210
He's gonna be fine.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.880
Don't worry, I got it.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.440
It's Sher... Sher...

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.160
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.150
Unlock the door!

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:34.090
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.960
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.520
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.200
Unlock the fucking door!

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.080
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.080
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.260
Heads up.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.470
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.060
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:09.900
Don't do...

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.400
Jesus! Oh, God!

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:16.500
You've got to start being more careful!

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.220
I don't think he understands!

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.810
Om.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.810
"You gotta take the safety off"?

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.410
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.870
- What?
- That's right!

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.330
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.100
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.230
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.610
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.200
Well, you know what, Tucker?

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.280
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.090
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.620
You don't like...

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.310
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.510
I like... I like it OK.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.860
You know... I'm sorry.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.730
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.490
Yeah, you kinda did.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.960
Cut it out!

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.760
Tucker...

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.470
where's Jangers?

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.480
- Shit.
- Stay here.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.650
Aah! Damn.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.620
Nuts...

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.830
Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.500
Oh, son of a bitch!

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.000
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.260
We gotta do something.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.890
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.650
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.710
Oh.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.550
All right.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.720
- Cover me.
- Uh...

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.890
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.860
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.610
Whoa!

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.910
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.040
Now, you create a distraction.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.420
I'm gonna go out the back door.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.800
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.010
Try not to shoot me.

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:36.020
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.860
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.990
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.830
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.630
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.770
Shit!

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.710
Jesus, Dale.
Take it easy.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:32.840
Hey, hillbilly!

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.590
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.400
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.730
Then bring out the girl!

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.660
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.240
I'm gonna get really mad!

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.830
I'll get really mad!

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.050
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.650
Oh!

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.030
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.600
Oh, God. Please, no.

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:21.580
Are we done yet?

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.050
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.640
All right...trap's set.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.190
Hey...he's awake.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.200
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.830
What is the matter with us?

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:42.040
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.080
Wait. Stop...

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.680
I've never stood so close
to pure evil before.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.570
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.200
OK! Don't...

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:06.010
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.850
It's payback time, hillbilly.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.360
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.280
I can get my cooler.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.910
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.580
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.830
- This is for Mike!
- No!

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.390
OW! You prick.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.070
- Dale?
- Allison.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.750
How are you feelin'?

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.170
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:52.380
Wha...

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.890
What happ...

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.720
- What happened?
- Oh...

00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.820
Well, uh...

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.540
I can't...
I can't really say.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.660
Um...

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.330
It was so awful.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.800
Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.600
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.940
It's good to cry sometimes.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.030
It's OK, just...

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.770
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.740
There you go. It'll feel better.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.220
Come on, just take a deep breath.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.320
There we go. Now...

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:43.110
Now tell me what happened.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.790
Well...it's hard to say.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.040
Um...

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.330
Your friends...

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.170
Do some of your friends take medication?

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.770
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.690
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.750
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.330
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.920
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.220
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:21.600
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.230
and then Todd was running at us, and...

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.320
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.670
At first I thought they
were trying to kill you,

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:37.930
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.170
and now they're going after my dog...

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.720
..Jangers.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.930
I guess they just like killing.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.400
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.190
Jesus, they're here!

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.450
They're not gonna stop till they kill
all of us, I'm telling you. Hide!

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.080
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.630
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.090
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.260
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.230
We'll clear it right up, OK?

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.320
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:13.910
Oh, my God.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.680
- Ugh!
- Allison!

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.150
Oh!

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.060
Did you see them?

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.480
- No.
- No?

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.450
That's from Tucker's shirt.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.630
What is that?

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.080
Oh, my God!

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.890
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.970
There's a note right there.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.050
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.230
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.350
A few hours.

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.100
I don't understand what...

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:34.650
I gotta go help Tucker.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.110
God damn it.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.790
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:44.000
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.710
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.760
Oh, and why would they think that?

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:53.140
I... I don't know.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.320
I think you do know.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.910
Well, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:04.460
we just thought that you looked...

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.420
a little creepy.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.630
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:11.630
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.890
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.740
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.360
I'm really sorry.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.200
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.080
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.760
somebody'd end up dead.

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.050
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.590
If you do see your friends...

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.480
tell 'em that I never
wanted to hurt anybody.

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.200
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.450
Don't go there.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.000
Oh, shit.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.460
Tucker!

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.170
Tucker, you cut there?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520
Tuck!

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:25.900
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.000
Tucker!

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.670
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:37.550
Tucker?!

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.550
Yeah.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.230
Tuck! Tucker!

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:44.570
- Dale...
- Hey!

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.030
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.620
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.040
What?

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.500
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.000
I don't wanna die! Please!

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.930
Oh, God! Tucker!

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.390
Dale...

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.400
Oh. Oh... Oh...

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.620
I never thought I'd say this,

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:10.450
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:13.660
That's funny.

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.580
Whoa...

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.010
- Oh...
- Dale...

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:22.640
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.020
I know. Let's get you down from there.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.150
Wait!

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.570
Sorry about that.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.320
This vacation sucks.

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:33.540
Come on, let's go.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.500
Look at this place.

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:59.970
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.680
Allison!

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.270
- Allison!
- Chad?

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.150
- Chad?
- Shh!

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.400
What are you guys doing?

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.320
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.580
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.120
Oh.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.340
This place is really freaky.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.050
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.260
They haven't done anything to me.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.560
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.650
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:36.110
What? No, no. Chad...

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.200
Chad! Stop.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.040
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:46.180
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.100
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:52.730
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.770
You have no idea...

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:58.160
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.000
- Huh?
- No.

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.500
These freaks are evil...

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.350
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.560
OK, just relax, all right?

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.070
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.060
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:20.370
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.500
By doing what? Saving my life?

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.420
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:30.140
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.100
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.480
You're falling in love with him?

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.860
No. W-What?

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:43.740
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:48.550
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.810
How could you love him?

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.810
Chad, please. You don't understand.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:58.690
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:00.530
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:05.080
Hey! Let the girl go.

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.580
Tcha!

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.760
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.970
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and let's talk this out, OK?

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.400
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.610
You could have fooled me.

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.200
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.200
Wait! How about I make some tea,

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.120
and we all sit and talk this out?

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:33.720
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.470
I'm gonna go get a beer.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:40.230
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.480
In this chair.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.160
Dale, you...

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:46.910
you sit in this one.

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.930
OK, good. Now, um...

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.360
I'm gonna get the tea.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:06.110
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:07.780
It's Earl Grey.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.950
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.050
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:23.600
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:24.740
OK?

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.410
OK.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.950
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.920
and understand each ether's perspective
before any progress can be made.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.960
OK.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.890
Chad, why don't you start?

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:46.310
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.110
A long time ago,

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.410
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:54.160
This is important.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:01.010
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.730
It was 20 years ago.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.560
The Memorial Day Massacre.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.040
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.670
My mother ran for her life.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:18.170
But they captured hen.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.140
My father was helpless...

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.860
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.170
And they forced him to watch...

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.470
while they tortured hen.

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:46.600
But my mom, she fought back...

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.690
..and she escaped.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.200
But my father wasn't so lucky.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.420
His body was never found.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.970
By the time I was born...

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.820
my mother was already institutionalized.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.120
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.340
OK. Um...

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.680
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.840
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.510
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.360
we come in, guns blazing.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:58.230
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:13.640
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:16.100
No!

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.440
No way.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.650
They're fucking trapped.

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.110
Oh...yeah.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.170
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.720
It's your turn.

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.350
OK, well...

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.980
First of all...

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:41.610
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.950
That is awful.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.460
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.470
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:55.810
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

01:03:55.850 --> 01:04:00.440
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.820
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.740
I just can't do it!

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.960
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.380
how do you feel?

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.220
I feel better. I feel...

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.430
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.980
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.030
It's show time, freaks!

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.910
Jason! No!

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:32.370
Jesus Christ!

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.760
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.470
Chad, st...

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.490
Get him, Tucker!

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.480
Dale!

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.200
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:53.710
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:56.000
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.640
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.470
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.190
Aargh!

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.320
Aargh!

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.650
Stop, drop, and roll!

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.080
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.550
He's crackling like a log!

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:19.880
Oh, that stinks.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.930
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.490
Allie, run!
Run!

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.570
Come on, let's go!

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:35.790
Help me!

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.880
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:49.690
My cabin.

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:52.200
Your cabin.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.790
I'm a terrible therapist.

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.960
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.380
I thought you did a great job in there.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.550
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.600
I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.730
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.940
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:18.170
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:20.010
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.340
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.270
Get to the truck!

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.610
Tucker! Tucker!

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.070
He's coming!

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.660
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.290
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.290
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.470
This is the only thing I got left.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.260
Go.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.740
Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.320
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.730
Jangers, not now, boy.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.790
Jangers, hey!

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.370
Whoa. Jangers!

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:24.080
Allie.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.500
Allison!

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.680
Jangers... Allison!

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.890
She's gone.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.600
What the hell... Tucker?

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.160
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:44.330
He took her.

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.250
I tried to stop him.

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:49.800
Whoa, take it easy.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.130
I tell you something, Dale.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.770
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:57.730
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:00.570
- Look at you.
- Nah.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.370
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.540
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.750
- That's not true.
- It is true!

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.560
I never should have even
came out here with you.

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.760
Listen to me.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.730
Do you remember when we was kids...

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.200
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.240
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:29.660
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:33.050
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:37.850
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:40.810
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.990
That always made me feel kinda funny.

01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:45.370
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.700
I didn't let you catch more.

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.090
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.180
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:59.560
What I'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:03.070
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:07.790
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.000
You know, I think that she...

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:15.010
really sees you for who you are.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:18.890
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.400
you two can...

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:24.600
_.date or something.

01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:28.740
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.570
I don't want any more negativity.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.460
- OK.
- Stop it!

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.880
- OK.
- You are a good man.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.180
You're smart...

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.720
and you're strong...

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.110
and you're not as ugly
as you think you are.

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:48.320
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.080
- Life is short.
- I know.

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:56.260
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.100
She needs you now more than ever,

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:03.560
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.520
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.040
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.750
I'll be fine. Go.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.220
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.860
Oh, Jesus!

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.570
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.240
OK.

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.460
That hurt very much!

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.790
I could tell. Just breathe in.

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:40.290
Out through your mouth.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.260
Go get her. Go get her.

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:45.770
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:48.900
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.530
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:54.070
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.240
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:20.960
OK. (Pants) You gotta let me
take it from here, OK, pup?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.130
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.170
More or less. OK, stay.

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:32.820
What is the matter with you?

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.280
What is the matter with me?

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.790
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:40.880
No.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.830
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.180
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.270
but you're gonna have to beg.

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.350
Chad...

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.850
Oh!

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.620
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.330
You see, we're making up, Allie,

01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:04.420
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.050
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:07.680
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:09.050
Just stop, please!

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:11.590
No. I'm not gonna stop.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.690
I've only just begun.

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:41.200
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:05.240
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.700
- It's OK.
- Dale?

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.450
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.840
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:14.720
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.190
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.980
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.450
Hang on.

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:29.250
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:32.550
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.940
How sweet.

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:46.820
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.200
What kind of knot is this?

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.000
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.720
It's time to say goodbye to the girl.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.930
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:03.650
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.320
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.570
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.580
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.670
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.400
Oh, that is really too bad.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.990
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.210
Dale!

01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:00.050
Dale!

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:06.850
Dale!

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:21.090
It's time for you to feel my pain.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.760
Bring it, frat bitch.

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:50.900
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:56.150
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.450
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:03.590
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.300
Put a couple boxes on there.

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.930
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:12.020
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:15.610
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:18.610
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.080
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.540
Nah! Shit...

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.840
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.920
Or not.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.610
Oh, my God. Dale?

01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:39.820
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.080
Look.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.210
- What?
- Something look familiar?

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:50.010
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:53.350
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:56.560
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.410
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.160
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.920
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.670
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.890
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.100
His father's body was never found.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.620
I think we've just found him.

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.820
Holy S-H-I-T.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.910
Jesus Christ!

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.540
Chad!

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:30.840
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.220
Just wait! Wait, wait!

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.970
Wait, Chad! Wait!

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.350
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.020
No! Look!

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.110
That's your real father.
Right there!

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.030
No. No!

01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.120
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:49.420
It can't be.

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:54.600
They lied to me!

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.150
How could they?

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.100
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:01.990
There is no truth!

01:18:02.650 --> 01:18:05.280
Everything is a lie!

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.500
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.840
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:18.350
that causes an anaphylactic reaction in
rare cases where people are allergic to it.

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.310
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:23.360
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.250
Or not.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.810
OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.120
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:50.700
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:58.430
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:00.180
is still being unravelled.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.930
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.450
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.620
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:15.500
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.420
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:22.880
high on prescription medication.

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:25.140
Yeah, looks like it.

01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:27.690
They found my fingers.

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.070
Check it out.

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:32.160
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:35.700
I don't remember that one looking that way.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:37.960
Does that look funny to you?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.380
No. No, not really.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.340
That looks natural. It's good.

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.310
By the way, I brought you something.

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:47.440
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.070
OK, open them.

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:51.740
Oh...

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.990
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:57.120
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.830
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:00.250
Look what else I got you.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.100
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:05.170
- - There you go.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.560
Mmm. Mmm!

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.770
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:13.690
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.080
- Dale?
- Yeah?

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.280
Did you ask her?

01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:22.760
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.560
Oh. Well...

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:30.640
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:31.730
Dale!

01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.900
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:39.160
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.370
Except for...

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:45.760
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.840
we're goin' bowling.

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:51.940
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.780
OW.

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.740
Whoo! Yes.

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:03.250
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:06.710
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.060
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.940
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.820
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.410
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:21.330
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.960
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.250
Yeah.

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.210
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.920
Hey.

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:32.680
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.190
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:39.320
but I got you a little something.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.870
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:44.210
I know. I wanted to.

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:47.090
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:51.010
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:52.640
It's a pink helmet.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.360
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.400
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.900
It's perfect.

01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:03.320
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.500
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.130
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:13.220
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.310
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:19.440
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.190
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:26.820
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:28.500
and I want to let you know that I...

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.090
I feel the same way.

01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.390
- Really?
- Really.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.150
BJ!

01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:44.480
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:45.620
Hell, no.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.000
Whatever.
