00:00:57.846 --> 00:01:00.222
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:02.557
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.435
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:07.105
She was singing about pirates!

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:09.272
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:12.527
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.945
Consider them marked.

00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:18.115
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.284
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board too.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:22.577
Even a miniature one.

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:26.164
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:29.961
Think again, Miss Swann.

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:32.880
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.092
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:38.760
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.140
A short drop and a sudden stop.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.812
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:53.484
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:55.360
My apologies, Governor Swann.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:57.655
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.488
Yes. That's what concerns me.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.187
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:34.608
Man overboard!

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.569
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:39.738
Haul him aboard!

00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:50.207
He's still breathing.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.542
Mary, Mother of God!

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:00.551
What happened here?

00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:05.763
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.390
Lot of good it did them.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:12.062
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.147
Pirates!

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:17.067
There's no proof of that!

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.650
It was probably an accident.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.029
Rouse the captain.

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:23.989
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.741
- Launch the boats.
- Heave to!

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:30.247
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:32.749
He'll be in your charge.

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:34.459
Take care of him.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.437
It's OK.

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:58.274
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.027
Will Turner.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.947
I'm watching over you, Will.

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:18.711
You're a pirate!

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.714
Has he said anything?

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:22.382
His name's William Turner.

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:23.966
That's all I found out.

00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:27.178
Take him below.

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.374
Elizabeth!

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:41.377
Are you all right?

00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:43.921
Are you decent?

00:05:44.548 --> 00:05:45.548
Yes.

00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:46.590
Yes?

00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:49.552
Still in bed at this hour?

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:53.889
It's a beautiful day.

00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.977
I have a gift for you.

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:02.897
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:06.987
May I inquire as to the occasion?

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.488
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:12.616
Go on.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.579
Actually, I...

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.875
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:23.210
Ceremony?

00:06:23.253 --> 00:06:25.671
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:26.922
I knew it!

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:30.300
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:32.302
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.596
He fancies you, you know.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.683
Elizabeth?

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:38.434
How's it coming?

00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:41.103
It's difficult to say.

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:43.439
I'm told it's
the latest fashion in London.

00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:44.856
Well, women in London

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.608
must've learned not to breathe!

00:06:48.778 --> 00:06:50.447
My Lord, you have a visitor.

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:09.965
Ah, Mr. Turner.

00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:11.467
Good to see you again.

00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:13.385
Good day, sir.

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:15.470
I have your order.

00:07:20.977 --> 00:07:22.144
Well...

00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:23.979
The blade is folded steel.

00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:27.065
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:29.026
If I may?

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:32.653
Perfectly balanced.

00:07:33.447 --> 00:07:35.741
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:40.829
Impressive. Very impressive.

00:07:40.872 --> 00:07:42.206
Very nice.

00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:45.875
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:49.505
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

00:07:51.673 --> 00:07:52.673
I shall.

00:07:54.134 --> 00:07:57.471
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:02.475
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning.

00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:04.352
Will.

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:07.522
It's so good to see you.

00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:09.273
I had a dream about you last night.

00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:10.358
About me?

00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:12.111
Is it entirely proper for you...?

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:13.986
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:16.864
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

00:08:16.907 --> 00:08:19.409
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.787
At least once more, Miss Swann.

00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:23.704
As always.

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:25.040
Now, you see?

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:27.375
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:28.710
We really must be going.

00:08:28.753 --> 00:08:29.753
Come on.

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:32.380
Good day, Mr. Turner.

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:34.967
Come along!

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:39.553
Good day...

00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:43.892
...Elizabeth.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.275
Hold up there, you!

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:21.279
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

00:10:23.282 --> 00:10:24.991
And I shall need to know your name.

00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:29.956
What do you say to three shillings,

00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:31.249
and we forget the name?

00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:36.920
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.208
Two paces... march!

00:11:17.753 --> 00:11:19.756
Right about... face!

00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:25.052
Present... arms!

00:11:49.327 --> 00:11:52.079
This dock is off-limits to civilians.

00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:53.913
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:56.667
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:03.881
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:07.094
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.138
did not merit an invitation?

00:12:09.222 --> 00:12:12.391
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

00:12:12.434 --> 00:12:14.811
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

00:12:14.894 --> 00:12:16.854
But it seems to me, a...

00:12:16.938 --> 00:12:18.688
A ship like that...

00:12:18.773 --> 00:12:21.776
...makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

00:12:21.818 --> 00:12:24.944
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:28.948
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.075
I've heard of one.

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:32.786
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.622
The Black Pearl.

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:38.665
There's no real ship

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.419
that can match the Interceptor.

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:44.131
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:45.799
No. No, it's not.

00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:47.175
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

00:12:47.926 --> 00:12:49.011
You've seen it?

00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:51.972
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it!

00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:54.764
- Yes, I have!
- You've seen a ship

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:56.812
with black sails,

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:58.562
that's crewed by the damned,

00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:01.147
and captained by a man so evil

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.817
that hell itself spat him back out?

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.861
No.

00:13:07.613 --> 00:13:10.030
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.992
Oh... And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:15.829
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:17.497
could possibly have black sails,

00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:19.833
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

00:13:19.875 --> 00:13:23.335
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

00:13:23.378 --> 00:13:24.504
No.

00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:25.838
Like I said,

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:29.134
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

00:13:31.596 --> 00:13:32.594
Hey!

00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:35.056
You!

00:13:35.558 --> 00:13:37.225
Get away from there!

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:39.685
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:41.439
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:42.521
Ship!

00:13:43.275 --> 00:13:44.274
What's your name?

00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:45.357
Smith!

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.152
Or Smithy, if you like.

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:50.489
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

00:13:50.532 --> 00:13:51.531
Yeah, and no lies!

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:53.075
All right then.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.159
I confess.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:57.871
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

00:13:57.954 --> 00:14:01.373
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:03.333
I said, no lies!

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.296
I think he's telling the truth.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.921
If he were telling the truth,

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:08.257
he wouldn't have told us.

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:12.760
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

00:14:23.481 --> 00:14:24.856
May I have a moment?

00:14:33.824 --> 00:14:35.574
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:37.411
Yes.

00:14:38.496 --> 00:14:41.164
I apologize if I seem forward,

00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.334
but I must speak my mind.

00:14:46.213 --> 00:14:49.214
This promotion throws into sharp relief

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:52.215
that which I have not yet achieved.

00:14:54.677 --> 00:14:56.430
A marriage to a fine woman.

00:14:57.973 --> 00:15:00.642
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:02.602
I can't breathe.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:04.478
Yes, I...

00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:06.064
I'm a bit nervous myself.

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:10.651
And then they made me their chief.

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.656
Elizabeth?

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:18.368
Elizabeth!

00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:23.330
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:28.128
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:32.297
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.050
Do not lose these!

00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:49.732
What was that?

00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:26.017
Make way!

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:33.566
I got her!

00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:36.111
She's not breathing!

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.196
Move!

00:16:44.287 --> 00:16:46.038
I never would've thought of that.

00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:48.372
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

00:16:53.963 --> 00:16:55.590
Where did you get that?

00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:00.011
On your feet.

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:02.638
Elizabeth!

00:17:03.973 --> 00:17:05.973
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

00:17:10.938 --> 00:17:13.523
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:15.608
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

00:17:22.992 --> 00:17:24.785
I believe thanks are in order.

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.250
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

00:17:32.293 --> 00:17:33.584
Pirate?

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:36.129
Hang him.

00:17:36.214 --> 00:17:38.964
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

00:17:40.218 --> 00:17:41.552
Well, well.

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:44.096
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.807
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:48.768
Well, I don't see your ship...

00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:49.976
...captain.

00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:52.437
I'm in the market, as it were.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.481
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

00:17:54.564 --> 00:17:57.359
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

00:18:00.822 --> 00:18:03.949
No additional shots nor powder.

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:07.620
A compass that doesn't point north.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.293
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:20.716
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:23.134
But you have heard of me.

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:28.639
Commodore, I really must protest!

00:18:28.724 --> 00:18:30.307
Carefully, lieutenant.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.643
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

00:18:32.687 --> 00:18:36.190
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:37.982
But it seems enough to condemn him.

00:18:38.066 --> 00:18:39.526
Indeed.

00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:42.779
Finally.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:45.156
Wait, don't shoot!

00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:46.532
I knew you'd warm up to me.

00:18:46.616 --> 00:18:49.412
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:51.163
And my hat.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.122
Commodore.

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:59.004
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

00:18:59.046 --> 00:19:01.673
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:04.343
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.096
Now, if you'll be very kind.

00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:25.529
Easy on the goods, darling.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.365
You're despicable.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.494
Sticks and stones, love.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.119
I saved your life, you save mine.

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.204
We're square.

00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:35.413
Gentlemen...

00:19:35.498 --> 00:19:36.958
...my lady...

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:40.377
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

00:19:40.462 --> 00:19:42.881
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.399
Whoa!

00:20:01.484 --> 00:20:02.942
Now, will you shoot him?

00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:04.694
Open fire!

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:07.614
Ahh!

00:20:11.994 --> 00:20:13.410
Burn his heels!

00:20:22.336 --> 00:20:23.547
Take steady aim.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:24.921
Fire!

00:20:28.844 --> 00:20:30.846
Take cover, men!

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.847
Gillette...

00:20:32.932 --> 00:20:35.767
...Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

00:20:36.144 --> 00:20:38.143
I would hate for him to miss it.

00:20:42.148 --> 00:20:43.566
Search upstairs!

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.111
Look lively, men!

00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:29.612
Whoa!

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.497
Right where I left you.

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.880
Not where I left you.

00:22:40.474 --> 00:22:42.309
You're the one they're hunting.

00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:44.478
The pirate!

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.357
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.069
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

00:22:51.152 --> 00:22:52.193
Ah...

00:22:52.236 --> 00:22:54.904
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

00:22:54.989 --> 00:22:56.490
So if you'll excuse me...

00:22:59.995 --> 00:23:02.161
Do you think this wise, boy?

00:23:03.123 --> 00:23:06.290
Crossing blades with a pirate?

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:07.751
You threatened Miss Swann.

00:23:10.796 --> 00:23:12.131
Only a little.

00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:28.897
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

00:23:29.773 --> 00:23:31.482
But how's your footwork?

00:23:31.567 --> 00:23:33.652
If I step here...

00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:36.447
Very good.

00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:38.574
And now I step again.

00:23:43.287 --> 00:23:44.621
Ta.

00:24:04.517 --> 00:24:06.184
That is a wonderful trick.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:11.148
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

00:24:11.232 --> 00:24:12.356
And now...

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:14.400
...you have no weapon.

00:24:36.757 --> 00:24:38.382
Who makes all these?

00:24:39.842 --> 00:24:41.179
I do.

00:24:41.222 --> 00:24:43.513
And I practice with them...

00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:45.182
...three hours a day.

00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:49.185
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

00:24:55.858 --> 00:24:58.778
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

00:24:58.862 --> 00:25:00.697
is that you already found one,

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.368
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

00:25:04.452 --> 00:25:06.870
You're not a eunuch, are you?

00:25:06.955 --> 00:25:09.915
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:11.374
I can kill him!

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:29.661
You cheated.

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:30.994
Pirate.

00:26:34.584 --> 00:26:36.626
- Move away!
- No.

00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:38.044
Please move?

00:26:38.128 --> 00:26:39.129
No!

00:26:39.172 --> 00:26:41.965
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

00:26:44.509 --> 00:26:46.509
This shot is not meant for you.

00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.856
There he is! Over here!

00:27:00.858 --> 00:27:02.816
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.697
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

00:27:06.782 --> 00:27:09.074
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:12.662
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:16.165
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:17.958
Take him away.

00:27:22.255 --> 00:27:25.173
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

00:27:25.216 --> 00:27:28.552
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:30.763
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

00:27:30.846 --> 00:27:33.348
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

00:27:33.433 --> 00:27:35.642
The dog is never going to move.

00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:39.980
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

00:27:41.024 --> 00:27:42.441
Come on!

00:27:46.697 --> 00:27:47.988
There you go, miss.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.825
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:53.536
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.205
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.541
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

00:27:58.583 --> 00:27:59.833
Sounds terrifying!

00:28:00.584 --> 00:28:03.337
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:05.381
But... the Commodore proposed!

00:28:05.465 --> 00:28:07.048
Fancy that.

00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:08.717
Now that's a smart match, miss,

00:28:08.801 --> 00:28:10.927
if it's not too bold to say.

00:28:11.013 --> 00:28:12.388
It is a smart match.

00:28:13.556 --> 00:28:15.348
He's a fine man.

00:28:16.642 --> 00:28:19.146
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

00:28:20.229 --> 00:28:22.356
Well, that Will Turner,

00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:24.566
he's a fine man too.

00:28:24.608 --> 00:28:26.402
That is too bold.

00:28:26.486 --> 00:28:28.571
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

00:28:28.613 --> 00:28:30.280
It was not my place.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.332
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:24.123
No, she hasn't.

00:29:24.166 --> 00:29:26.503
Well, she has had a very trying day.

00:29:28.173 --> 00:29:30.339
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

00:29:30.423 --> 00:29:32.300
Bleak. Really bleak.

00:29:34.096 --> 00:29:35.095
What's that?

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.056
Cannon fire!

00:29:39.432 --> 00:29:41.309
Return fire!

00:29:41.352 --> 00:29:44.396
I know those guns!

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:51.361
It's the Pearl!

00:29:51.444 --> 00:29:53.155
Black Pearl?

00:29:55.657 --> 00:29:57.283
I've heard stories.

00:29:57.326 --> 00:30:01.328
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

00:30:01.413 --> 00:30:02.998
Never leaves any survivors.

00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.499
No survivors.

00:30:04.542 --> 00:30:07.377
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

00:30:16.679 --> 00:30:18.432
Clear the dock!

00:30:31.985 --> 00:30:33.652
Mama!

00:30:40.244 --> 00:30:41.870
Hoist your oars!

00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:49.127
Come on, you!

00:31:39.886 --> 00:31:41.721
Sight the muzzle flash.

00:31:41.764 --> 00:31:42.764
Aim for the flashes.

00:31:42.848 --> 00:31:44.933
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

00:31:44.975 --> 00:31:46.642
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges!

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.647
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

00:31:51.606 --> 00:31:52.606
Good God!

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.274
That's an order.

00:32:11.209 --> 00:32:13.503
Don't!

00:32:14.295 --> 00:32:15.462
Hello, chum.

00:32:19.718 --> 00:32:21.261
Up there! Go!

00:32:31.062 --> 00:32:33.690
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

00:32:33.774 --> 00:32:36.316
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:37.569
In here!

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.574
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:54.710
Got ya! Haven't I?

00:32:58.214 --> 00:33:01.716
No! No! It's hot!

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.678
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:09.474
Come on, me lads!

00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:38.670
Come out.

00:33:47.638 --> 00:33:50.473
We know you're here, poppet.

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:52.725
Poppet.

00:33:52.809 --> 00:33:53.852
Come out...

00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:56.981
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.315
Eh?

00:34:00.067 --> 00:34:02.069
We will find you, poppet.

00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.530
You've got something of ours,

00:34:05.573 --> 00:34:07.365
and it calls to us.

00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:15.582
The gold calls to us.

00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:17.793
The gold.

00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:25.966
Hello, poppet.

00:34:26.511 --> 00:34:27.512
Parley!

00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:29.429
What?

00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:30.639
Parley.

00:34:30.723 --> 00:34:32.139
I invoke the right of parley.

00:34:32.224 --> 00:34:36.144
According to the code of Brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

00:34:36.229 --> 00:34:39.314
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:42.107
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:44.944
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

00:34:45.028 --> 00:34:46.987
She wants to be taken to the captain.

00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:50.784
And she'll go, without a fuss.

00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:54.869
We must honor the code.

00:35:05.508 --> 00:35:06.882
Say goodbye!

00:35:11.598 --> 00:35:12.847
Goodbye.

00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:18.771
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

00:35:20.272 --> 00:35:21.399
Well!

00:35:28.197 --> 00:35:29.779
Out of my way, scum!

00:35:42.419 --> 00:35:45.336
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:11.114
Come on, doggy!
It's just you and me now.

00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:13.574
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:15.368
Come on. That's a boy!

00:36:15.411 --> 00:36:17.578
Good boy. Come get your bone!

00:36:17.662 --> 00:36:21.540
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:23.667
That's it! That's it, doggy!

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.130
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

00:36:28.382 --> 00:36:30.049
Don't do that. No, no, no!

00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:31.759
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

00:36:38.642 --> 00:36:40.184
This ain't the armory!

00:36:41.895 --> 00:36:43.104
Well, well, well.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.065
Look what we have here, Twigg.

00:36:46.149 --> 00:36:48.235
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:51.569
Last time I saw you,

00:36:51.612 --> 00:36:53.405
you were all alone

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.242
on a godforsaken island,

00:36:56.284 --> 00:36:58.495
shrinking into the distance.

00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:01.079
His fortunes aren't improved much.

00:37:01.163 --> 00:37:04.584
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

00:37:04.627 --> 00:37:07.670
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

00:37:07.754 --> 00:37:09.296
and mutineers.

00:37:13.426 --> 00:37:14.927
So there is a curse.

00:37:16.637 --> 00:37:18.013
That's interesting.

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:20.350
You know nothing of hell.

00:37:29.024 --> 00:37:31.025
That's very interesting.

00:38:06.479 --> 00:38:09.022
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

00:38:09.107 --> 00:38:12.151
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

00:38:12.235 --> 00:38:16.070
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

00:38:17.073 --> 00:38:19.158
And ye will not lay a hand on those

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.618
under the protection of parley.

00:38:22.245 --> 00:38:23.412
Aye, sir.

00:38:26.124 --> 00:38:28.042
My apologies, miss.

00:38:29.127 --> 00:38:30.461
Captain Barbossa,

00:38:30.503 --> 00:38:34.924
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

00:38:36.009 --> 00:38:40.054
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are naught but humble pirates.

00:38:41.139 --> 00:38:42.724
What is it that you want?

00:38:42.808 --> 00:38:45.100
I want you to leave
and never come back.

00:38:47.562 --> 00:38:50.189
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

00:38:51.775 --> 00:38:54.108
Means "no."

00:38:55.528 --> 00:38:56.528
Very well.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.116
I'll drop it.

00:39:05.163 --> 00:39:09.791
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

00:39:09.875 --> 00:39:10.918
Why?

00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:14.338
It's what you've been searching for.

00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:16.047
I recognize the ship.

00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:19.008
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

00:39:19.051 --> 00:39:20.220
Did you now?

00:39:23.222 --> 00:39:24.222
Fine.

00:39:25.224 --> 00:39:26.809
I suppose if it is worthless,

00:39:26.893 --> 00:39:28.727
then there's no point in me keeping it.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.062
No!

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.074
You have a name, missy?

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.243
Elizabeth...

00:39:45.327 --> 00:39:46.661
...Turner.

00:39:47.788 --> 00:39:49.873
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

00:39:53.168 --> 00:39:54.586
Miss Turner!

00:39:55.797 --> 00:39:57.046
Turner!

00:39:57.089 --> 00:39:58.506
Bootstrap!

00:40:02.553 --> 00:40:05.221
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:07.849
Family heirloom, perhaps?

00:40:07.933 --> 00:40:10.436
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

00:40:12.022 --> 00:40:15.105
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

00:40:15.189 --> 00:40:16.399
and ne'er return.

00:40:30.122 --> 00:40:31.121
Our bargain?

00:40:34.126 --> 00:40:35.961
Still the guns and stow 'em.

00:40:36.004 --> 00:40:38.839
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:40.631
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

00:40:40.674 --> 00:40:43.301
According to the code of
the order of the Brethren...

00:40:43.385 --> 00:40:47.055
Your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreements,

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:48.307
so I must do nothin'.

00:40:48.391 --> 00:40:51.477
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:53.144
and you're not, and thirdly...

00:40:53.187 --> 00:40:55.939
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

00:40:55.982 --> 00:40:57.482
instead of actual rules.

00:40:57.524 --> 00:40:59.941
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

00:40:59.984 --> 00:41:01.486
Miss Turner.

00:41:22.173 --> 00:41:24.591
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

00:41:24.675 --> 00:41:26.763
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

00:41:27.846 --> 00:41:29.931
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

00:41:30.015 --> 00:41:32.056
And where do you propose we start?

00:41:33.311 --> 00:41:36.978
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

00:41:39.274 --> 00:41:41.025
That Jack Sparrow!

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.362
He talked about the Black Pearl.

00:41:43.404 --> 00:41:45.321
Mentioned it is more what he did.

00:41:46.906 --> 00:41:50.034
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

00:41:50.077 --> 00:41:51.577
No.

00:41:51.662 --> 00:41:54.956
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.041
ergo they are not his allies.

00:41:58.084 --> 00:42:01.087
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

00:42:01.171 --> 00:42:03.047
That's not good enough!

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.049
Mr. Turner...

00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:08.636
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

00:42:09.678 --> 00:42:11.056
You are a blacksmith.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.933
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

00:42:16.228 --> 00:42:19.229
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

00:42:19.313 --> 00:42:20.816
who cares for Elizabeth.

00:42:26.822 --> 00:42:28.572
Please...

00:42:32.952 --> 00:42:34.162
You! Sparrow!

00:42:34.246 --> 00:42:35.246
Aye?

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:37.914
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

00:42:37.957 --> 00:42:39.332
I've heard of it.

00:42:39.417 --> 00:42:42.086
Where does it make berth?

00:42:43.088 --> 00:42:45.046
Have you not heard the stories?

00:42:46.757 --> 00:42:48.718
Captain Barbossa

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.511
and his crew of miscreants

00:42:50.596 --> 00:42:53.181
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

00:42:53.265 --> 00:42:56.059
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

00:42:56.102 --> 00:42:59.186
by those who already know where it is.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.937
The ship's real enough,

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.441
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

00:43:05.444 --> 00:43:06.611
Why ask me?

00:43:07.279 --> 00:43:08.863
Because you're a pirate.

00:43:08.946 --> 00:43:11.616
And you want to turn
pirate yourself. ls that it?

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:13.868
Never!

00:43:17.621 --> 00:43:19.290
They took Miss Swann.

00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:21.167
Oh. So it is that you found a girl!

00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:23.043
I see.

00:43:23.127 --> 00:43:25.881
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

00:43:25.965 --> 00:43:27.924
and so win fair lady's heart...

00:43:27.966 --> 00:43:30.593
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

00:43:30.636 --> 00:43:32.719
I see no profit in it for me.

00:43:33.804 --> 00:43:35.056
I can get you out of here.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.806
How's that? The key's run off.

00:43:36.849 --> 00:43:38.475
I helped build these cells.

00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:41.312
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

00:43:42.606 --> 00:43:45.899
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

00:43:47.026 --> 00:43:48.444
the door will lift free.

00:43:50.822 --> 00:43:52.072
What's your name?

00:43:52.156 --> 00:43:54.074
Will Turner.

00:43:55.368 --> 00:43:57.703
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

00:43:57.788 --> 00:43:58.954
Good, strong name.

00:43:59.956 --> 00:44:01.872
No doubt named for your father?

00:44:03.503 --> 00:44:04.584
Yes.

00:44:04.669 --> 00:44:06.586
Uh-huh.

00:44:07.463 --> 00:44:08.797
Well, Mr. Turner,

00:44:08.838 --> 00:44:10.048
I've changed me mind.

00:44:10.717 --> 00:44:13.718
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

00:44:13.803 --> 00:44:16.012
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

00:44:16.055 --> 00:44:17.722
and your bonny lass.

00:44:17.808 --> 00:44:19.809
Do we have an accord?

00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:25.146
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

00:44:25.189 --> 00:44:26.356
Get me out.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.655
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

00:44:40.246 --> 00:44:41.746
We're going to steal the ship?

00:44:43.541 --> 00:44:44.541
That ship?

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:46.457
Commandeer.

00:44:46.542 --> 00:44:48.795
We're going to commandeer that ship.

00:44:48.879 --> 00:44:49.964
Nautical term.

00:44:50.633 --> 00:44:52.716
One question about your business, boy,

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.217
or there's no use going.

00:44:54.302 --> 00:44:55.801
This girl...

00:44:55.885 --> 00:44:58.595
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.016
I'd die for her.

00:45:00.058 --> 00:45:01.265
Oh, good.

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:03.351
No worries then.

00:45:22.372 --> 00:45:24.914
This is either madness or brilliance.

00:45:25.709 --> 00:45:29.336
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.786
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.579
Aye! Avast!

00:46:07.792 --> 00:46:10.126
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

00:46:11.003 --> 00:46:12.798
You'll never make it out of the bay.

00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:14.464
Son...

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:18.342
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:19.970
Savvy?

00:46:23.473 --> 00:46:24.473
Commodore!

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:27.142
- Sir!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

00:46:28.814 --> 00:46:29.896
Commodore!

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.315
They're taking the ship!

00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:35.652
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

00:46:35.694 --> 00:46:37.152
Rash, Turner.

00:46:37.237 --> 00:46:38.821
Too rash.

00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:44.578
That is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

00:46:47.874 --> 00:46:49.165
Here they come.

00:46:54.004 --> 00:46:56.255
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

00:47:02.804 --> 00:47:05.974
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

00:47:19.113 --> 00:47:21.906
Check the aft!

00:47:21.991 --> 00:47:24.366
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:25.785
Quickly, men

00:47:27.163 --> 00:47:28.454
Whoa!

00:47:30.873 --> 00:47:34.795
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

00:47:34.879 --> 00:47:37.463
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

00:47:40.718 --> 00:47:42.759
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

00:47:42.844 --> 00:47:45.387
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

00:47:45.472 --> 00:47:48.391
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

00:47:48.476 --> 00:47:50.559
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

00:47:50.602 --> 00:47:51.978
Bring out the guns!

00:47:52.062 --> 00:47:54.647
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

00:47:54.731 --> 00:47:58.567
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:03.197
Commodore! He's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.911
Abandon ship!

00:48:12.749 --> 00:48:15.166
Let go the gear
and sheet home.

00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:17.711
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

00:48:18.923 --> 00:48:21.549
So it would seem.

00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:32.099
When I was a lad,
living in England,

00:48:32.184 --> 00:48:34.061
my mother raised me by herself.

00:48:34.146 --> 00:48:36.104
After she died, I came out here,

00:48:36.189 --> 00:48:38.023
looking for my father.

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:40.609
Is that so?

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.362
My father,

00:48:43.446 --> 00:48:44.821
Bill Turner?

00:48:44.906 --> 00:48:48.493
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:51.286
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

00:48:51.329 --> 00:48:52.912
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

00:48:52.955 --> 00:48:54.956
You knew my father.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.171
I knew him.

00:49:02.256 --> 00:49:05.175
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.679
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:09.762
Bootstrap?

00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:13.183
Good man.
Good pirate.

00:49:13.268 --> 00:49:15.353
I swear, you look just like him.

00:49:15.437 --> 00:49:16.478
It's not true.

00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:18.314
He was a merchant sailor.

00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:20.649
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:22.900
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

00:49:24.278 --> 00:49:26.989
My father was not a pirate!

00:49:28.157 --> 00:49:30.157
Put it away, son.

00:49:30.242 --> 00:49:32.159
It's not worth you getting beat again.

00:49:32.244 --> 00:49:33.371
You didn't beat me.

00:49:33.455 --> 00:49:36.790
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

00:49:36.832 --> 00:49:39.667
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

00:49:47.009 --> 00:49:50.263
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

00:49:50.347 --> 00:49:52.848
The only rules
that really matter are these:

00:49:52.933 --> 00:49:56.810
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.687
For instance,

00:49:58.771 --> 00:50:01.897
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

00:50:01.982 --> 00:50:03.025
or you can't.

00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:06.612
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

00:50:07.487 --> 00:50:09.655
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

00:50:09.698 --> 00:50:14.201
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

00:50:14.536 --> 00:50:15.537
So...

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:23.919
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

00:50:25.174 --> 00:50:26.505
Or can you not?

00:50:29.217 --> 00:50:30.259
Tortuga?

00:50:30.345 --> 00:50:32.094
Tortuga.

00:50:54.158 --> 00:50:56.578
More importantly, it is indeed

00:50:56.621 --> 00:50:58.497
a sad life that has never
breathed deep

00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.748
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

00:51:03.503 --> 00:51:04.627
What do you think?

00:51:08.924 --> 00:51:10.008
It'll linger.

00:51:10.093 --> 00:51:14.095
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

00:51:14.179 --> 00:51:16.639
no man would ever feel unwanted.

00:51:18.601 --> 00:51:19.685
Scarlett!

00:51:21.604 --> 00:51:22.937
Not sure I deserved that.

00:51:24.731 --> 00:51:25.899
Giselle!

00:51:25.942 --> 00:51:26.940
Who was she?

00:51:27.024 --> 00:51:28.026
What?

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.612
I may have deserved that.

00:51:33.866 --> 00:51:36.992
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

00:51:39.328 --> 00:51:41.455
Mother's love!

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.540
Jack!

00:51:43.542 --> 00:51:46.670
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

00:51:46.754 --> 00:51:50.632
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

00:51:50.717 --> 00:51:54.009
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

00:51:54.094 --> 00:51:57.513
and the man who was sleeping drinks
it while listening to a proposition

00:51:57.597 --> 00:51:59.306
from the man who did the waking.

00:52:01.475 --> 00:52:03.311
Aye, that'll about do it.

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:10.402
Blast! I'm already awake!

00:52:10.486 --> 00:52:11.861
That was for the smell.

00:52:15.157 --> 00:52:16.156
Eh...

00:52:22.331 --> 00:52:23.830
Keep a sharp eye.

00:52:30.963 --> 00:52:32.047
Now...

00:52:32.132 --> 00:52:34.593
...what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

00:52:36.427 --> 00:52:40.849
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.851
I know where it's going to be,

00:52:43.895 --> 00:52:45.685
and I'm gonna take it.

00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:47.731
Jack,

00:52:47.815 --> 00:52:50.107
it's a fool's errand!

00:52:50.192 --> 00:52:53.528
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:56.113
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

00:52:56.699 --> 00:52:58.032
All I need is a crew.

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.742
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

00:53:00.826 --> 00:53:03.829
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

00:53:03.872 --> 00:53:06.080
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool then.

00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:07.291
Prove me wrong!

00:53:07.957 --> 00:53:11.296
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.715
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.386
Hm?

00:53:21.556 --> 00:53:22.598
Mm.

00:53:22.682 --> 00:53:24.057
Huh?

00:53:24.099 --> 00:53:25.226
Hm...

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:26.310
Mm-hm-hm.

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:31.941
The kid?

00:53:33.527 --> 00:53:36.529
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:40.075
His only child. Savvy?

00:53:40.159 --> 00:53:42.076
Is he now?

00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:47.415
Leverage, says you.

00:53:47.499 --> 00:53:50.084
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

00:53:50.167 --> 00:53:51.919
- Mm.
- I'll find us a crew.

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.879
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

00:53:54.923 --> 00:53:57.299
One can only hope.

00:53:57.384 --> 00:54:00.133
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

00:54:24.994 --> 00:54:26.787
You'll be dining with the captain,

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.206
and he requests you wear this.

00:54:30.165 --> 00:54:33.752
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.172
He said you'd say that.

00:54:37.257 --> 00:54:39.633
He also said, if that be the case...

00:54:39.718 --> 00:54:41.467
...you'll be dining with the crew,

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.345
and you'll be naked.

00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:50.894
Fine.

00:55:07.536 --> 00:55:11.124
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

00:55:11.167 --> 00:55:13.542
You must be hungry.

00:55:30.976 --> 00:55:32.184
Try the wine.

00:55:37.024 --> 00:55:40.026
And the apples. One of those next.

00:55:48.327 --> 00:55:49.994
It's poisoned.

00:55:51.538 --> 00:55:53.873
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

00:55:53.916 --> 00:55:57.376
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

00:56:01.383 --> 00:56:03.424
You don't know what this is,

00:56:03.509 --> 00:56:04.885
do you?

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.219
It's a pirate medallion.

00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:09.346
This is Aztec gold.

00:56:10.224 --> 00:56:13.016
One of 882 identical pieces

00:56:13.059 --> 00:56:16.646
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

00:56:17.732 --> 00:56:21.943
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

00:56:22.027 --> 00:56:25.863
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

00:56:25.906 --> 00:56:29.407
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.913
...a terrible curse.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.792
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

00:56:39.795 --> 00:56:42.254
...shall be punished for eternity.

00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:47.927
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

00:56:48.012 --> 00:56:49.263
Aye.

00:56:50.056 --> 00:56:53.599
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:56.561
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

00:56:56.603 --> 00:56:58.480
except for those who know where it is.

00:57:00.189 --> 00:57:01.523
Find it, we did.

00:57:03.193 --> 00:57:04.526
There be the chest.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:06.405
Inside be the gold.

00:57:07.363 --> 00:57:09.781
And we took 'em all!

00:57:09.825 --> 00:57:11.826
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.578
and frittered 'em away

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.371
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

00:57:16.455 --> 00:57:18.458
The more we gave 'em away,

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.169
the more we came to realize...

00:57:22.463 --> 00:57:24.630
...the drink would not satisfy.

00:57:25.883 --> 00:57:28.634
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

00:57:29.302 --> 00:57:31.887
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

00:57:31.971 --> 00:57:33.973
could not slake our lust.

00:57:35.851 --> 00:57:38.644
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

00:57:40.398 --> 00:57:43.067
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:46.485
...we are consumed by it.

00:57:57.664 --> 00:58:00.582
There is one way we can end our curse.

00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:07.631
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

00:58:07.673 --> 00:58:09.091
must be restored,

00:58:09.175 --> 00:58:11.594
and the blood repaid.

00:58:14.348 --> 00:58:15.723
Thanks to ye,

00:58:15.808 --> 00:58:17.935
we have the final piece.

00:58:19.978 --> 00:58:22.270
And the... blood to be repaid?

00:58:22.355 --> 00:58:24.857
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

00:58:25.651 --> 00:58:26.650
Yet.

00:58:28.694 --> 00:58:30.196
Apple?

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:35.201
Ha-ha. Hah!

00:58:35.244 --> 00:58:38.161
Arrgh!

00:58:38.204 --> 00:58:39.747
No!

00:58:47.047 --> 00:58:48.047
I'm curious.

00:58:48.132 --> 00:58:51.049
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

00:59:54.615 --> 00:59:56.824
Look!

00:59:56.909 --> 00:59:59.827
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:03.873
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

01:00:03.957 --> 01:00:05.623
But neither are we dead.

01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:10.671
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:13.131
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

01:00:13.216 --> 01:00:14.841
and haven't died!

01:00:15.467 --> 01:00:17.261
I feel nothing.

01:00:18.054 --> 01:00:20.972
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

01:00:22.391 --> 01:00:24.558
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

01:00:25.561 --> 01:00:30.066
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.148
You're in one!

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.170
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

01:01:01.389 --> 01:01:03.056
Feast your eyes, captain.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.058
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

01:01:06.142 --> 01:01:09.353
Every man worth his salt...

01:01:09.396 --> 01:01:11.439
...and crazy to boot.

01:01:11.524 --> 01:01:14.359
So this is your able-bodied crew?

01:01:20.199 --> 01:01:21.199
You, sailor!

01:01:21.284 --> 01:01:22.659
Cotton, sir.

01:01:22.702 --> 01:01:24.493
Mr. Cotton.

01:01:24.536 --> 01:01:27.871
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:29.541
in the face of danger and death?

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:31.292
Mr. Cotton!

01:01:31.375 --> 01:01:32.502
Answer, man!

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:33.962
He's a mute, sir.

01:01:34.046 --> 01:01:35.756
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:37.881
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

01:01:37.966 --> 01:01:39.844
No one's yet figured how.

01:01:43.054 --> 01:01:44.681
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

01:01:45.682 --> 01:01:47.183
Same question.

01:01:47.226 --> 01:01:49.978
- Wind in your sails.
- Wind in your sails.

01:01:51.106 --> 01:01:53.188
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:54.735
Of course it does.

01:01:54.817 --> 01:01:55.817
Satisfied?

01:01:56.777 --> 01:01:58.778
Well, you've proved they're mad!

01:01:58.863 --> 01:02:00.739
And what's the benefit for us?

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.333
Anamaria!

01:02:14.253 --> 01:02:16.588
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

01:02:16.672 --> 01:02:18.589
No, that one I deserved.

01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:20.383
You stole my boat!

01:02:20.426 --> 01:02:21.508
Actually...

01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:25.972
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

01:02:26.058 --> 01:02:28.640
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:30.142
But you didn't!

01:02:30.226 --> 01:02:31.602
You'll get another one!

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.980
I will!

01:02:34.065 --> 01:02:35.439
A better one.

01:02:35.523 --> 01:02:37.440
A better one!

01:02:37.524 --> 01:02:39.110
- That one!
- What one?

01:02:41.822 --> 01:02:42.989
That one?

01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:48.161
Aye. That one.

01:02:48.245 --> 01:02:49.828
- What say you?
- Aye!

01:02:49.913 --> 01:02:51.288
Aye!

01:02:51.373 --> 01:02:53.373
Anchors away!

01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.667
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

01:02:55.752 --> 01:02:57.253
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

01:02:57.296 --> 01:02:59.963
It'll be far worse not to have her.

01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:36.708
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

01:03:36.793 --> 01:03:39.253
with a compass that doesn't work?

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:41.297
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.173
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:57.229
We should drop canvas, sir.

01:03:57.313 --> 01:03:59.355
She can hold a bit longer.

01:04:01.567 --> 01:04:05.113
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

01:04:05.197 --> 01:04:07.197
We're catching up.

01:04:22.214 --> 01:04:24.214
Time to go, poppet.

01:05:19.771 --> 01:05:24.190
Dead men tell no tales...

01:05:26.735 --> 01:05:29.404
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:31.280
have been claimed by this passage.

01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:49.131
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

01:05:49.174 --> 01:05:52.385
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

01:05:52.469 --> 01:05:55.138
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

01:05:55.223 --> 01:05:56.472
That was before I met him,

01:05:56.557 --> 01:05:58.723
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:00.602
What?

01:06:04.274 --> 01:06:05.732
He failed to mention that.

01:06:05.816 --> 01:06:08.067
He plays things closer to the vest now.

01:06:08.151 --> 01:06:10.237
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

01:06:10.321 --> 01:06:13.198
Three days out on the venture,
the first mate says,

01:06:13.282 --> 01:06:16.367
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:19.830
of the treasure too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:22.165
That night, there was a mutiny.

01:06:23.208 --> 01:06:25.877
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

01:06:25.962 --> 01:06:28.630
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.009
Ah...

01:06:32.719 --> 01:06:35.138
So that's the reason for all the...

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.889
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:42.019
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:44.855
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

01:06:44.897 --> 01:06:48.232
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:51.528
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

01:06:51.571 --> 01:06:54.948
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

01:06:55.033 --> 01:06:57.034
But Jack, he escaped the island,

01:06:57.118 --> 01:06:58.701
and still has that single shot.

01:06:58.785 --> 01:07:01.370
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man.

01:07:02.372 --> 01:07:04.415
His mutinous first mate.

01:07:04.499 --> 01:07:06.459
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:10.672
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

01:07:10.715 --> 01:07:12.842
He waded out into the shallows,

01:07:12.885 --> 01:07:15.468
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:19.389
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:21.933
And on the fourth morning,

01:07:22.018 --> 01:07:26.146
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

01:07:28.399 --> 01:07:30.815
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.194
Sea turtles!

01:07:34.447 --> 01:07:36.447
What did he use for rope?

01:07:41.412 --> 01:07:42.995
Human hair.

01:07:43.997 --> 01:07:45.414
From my back.

01:07:46.582 --> 01:07:47.959
Let go the anchor!

01:07:48.044 --> 01:07:50.419
Lower the anchor line!

01:07:50.504 --> 01:07:52.921
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:54.675
Captain.

01:07:54.759 --> 01:07:56.467
What if the worst should happen?

01:07:57.345 --> 01:07:59.846
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

01:08:25.665 --> 01:08:26.831
Move.

01:08:26.915 --> 01:08:28.916
Ten years of hoarding swag!

01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:31.459
And now we finally get to spend it!

01:08:34.298 --> 01:08:35.298
Oh.

01:08:38.802 --> 01:08:41.596
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

01:08:42.306 --> 01:08:46.015
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.020
This one does splinter
something terrible!

01:08:49.105 --> 01:08:51.314
Stop rubbing it!

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.566
Oh!

01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:14.003
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

01:09:14.045 --> 01:09:16.337
The pirates' code.

01:09:16.423 --> 01:09:17.839
Any man who falls behind...

01:09:17.882 --> 01:09:20.216
...is left behind.

01:09:21.553 --> 01:09:23.846
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

01:09:24.558 --> 01:09:27.641
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.602
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:32.688
Sprung a man from jail...

01:09:34.024 --> 01:09:36.524
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:39.111
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

01:09:41.281 --> 01:09:44.532
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

01:09:47.287 --> 01:09:48.412
That's not true.

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:50.872
I am not obsessed with treasure.

01:09:58.089 --> 01:10:00.840
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:02.927
Gentlemen, the time has come!

01:10:03.011 --> 01:10:04.221
Hurrah!

01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:06.430
Salvation is nigh!

01:10:06.515 --> 01:10:07.931
Yeah!

01:10:08.015 --> 01:10:10.726
- Our torment is near an end!
- Elizabeth.

01:10:11.394 --> 01:10:14.271
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

01:10:14.355 --> 01:10:15.981
and each man-jack of you here

01:10:16.066 --> 01:10:19.068
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:21.403
And 100 times again!

01:10:21.446 --> 01:10:23.530
Yeah!

01:10:23.572 --> 01:10:25.157
Suffered, I have!

01:10:25.908 --> 01:10:27.743
Punished, we were,

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:29.327
the lot of us,

01:10:29.411 --> 01:10:32.747
disproportionate to our crime!

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.625
Right!

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:35.917
Here it is!

01:10:39.588 --> 01:10:43.217
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

01:10:45.218 --> 01:10:47.763
Every last piece that went astray,

01:10:47.806 --> 01:10:49.557
we have returned.

01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:51.307
Save for this!

01:10:51.392 --> 01:10:52.810
- Yeah!
- Jack!

01:10:52.894 --> 01:10:55.521
Not yet!

01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:58.106
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.941
...Despairing
of ever finding the lass.

01:11:00.984 --> 01:11:02.821
When's that?

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:05.614
When it's of greatest profit to you?

01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:06.990
May I ask you something?

01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:10.702
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.079
Do us a favor.

01:11:13.122 --> 01:11:15.248
I know it's difficult for you,

01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:17.333
but please, stay here,

01:11:17.418 --> 01:11:20.295
and try not to do anything stupid.

01:11:22.965 --> 01:11:25.467
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:27.803
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:30.723
And whose blood must yet be paid?

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:32.473
Hers!

01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:39.229
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:44.986
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:54.746
Begun by blood,

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:56.832
by blood undone.

01:12:01.294 --> 01:12:02.338
Sorry, Jack.

01:12:02.422 --> 01:12:04.963
I'm not going to be your leverage.

01:12:14.182 --> 01:12:16.350
That's it?

01:12:16.392 --> 01:12:18.062
Waste not.

01:12:56.058 --> 01:12:57.392
Did it work?

01:12:57.434 --> 01:13:00.311
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

01:13:07.402 --> 01:13:08.903
You're not dead!

01:13:09.947 --> 01:13:12.448
No.

01:13:12.533 --> 01:13:13.865
He shot me!

01:13:13.908 --> 01:13:17.453
It didn't work!
The curse is still upon us!

01:13:22.543 --> 01:13:25.004
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

01:13:25.088 --> 01:13:27.338
Was your father William Turner?

01:13:27.673 --> 01:13:28.922
No.

01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:32.468
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

01:13:32.553 --> 01:13:35.596
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.931
Where?

01:13:43.312 --> 01:13:44.480
You two!

01:13:45.605 --> 01:13:47.692
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

01:13:48.651 --> 01:13:49.651
No!

01:13:50.405 --> 01:13:53.113
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

01:13:53.198 --> 01:13:55.825
She said her name
was Turner. You heard her!

01:13:57.703 --> 01:14:00.371
- I think she lied to us!
- Yeah!

01:14:01.622 --> 01:14:03.957
You brought us here for nothing!

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.128
I won't take questionin' or second
guesses, not from you, Mr. Twigg!

01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:12.468
Who's to blame him? Every decision
you made has led us from bad to worse!

01:14:14.678 --> 01:14:17.263
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

01:14:17.306 --> 01:14:18.305
Yeah!

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.685
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:28.148
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

01:14:30.443 --> 01:14:32.361
I say, we cut her throat,

01:14:32.446 --> 01:14:34.071
and spill all her blood!

01:14:34.155 --> 01:14:35.156
Just in case.

01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:36.656
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:14:36.741 --> 01:14:39.284
Yeah!

01:14:45.249 --> 01:14:46.500
The medallion!

01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:47.835
She's taken it!

01:14:47.877 --> 01:14:52.381
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.972
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

01:15:01.015 --> 01:15:03.851
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

01:15:12.944 --> 01:15:14.695
You!

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:17.698
You're supposed to be dead!

01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:19.075
Am I not?

01:15:21.035 --> 01:15:22.035
Oh.

01:15:29.127 --> 01:15:30.584
Puh-la-lem.

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:34.215
Puh-la-lie-lay-lool.

01:15:36.802 --> 01:15:38.426
Pah-lee-nee...

01:15:38.511 --> 01:15:41.263
...parsnip... par-sley...

01:15:41.348 --> 01:15:43.348
...par... partner, pardoner...

01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:44.390
Parley?

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:46.309
That's the one! Parley!

01:15:47.061 --> 01:15:48.062
Parley!

01:15:48.105 --> 01:15:49.397
Parley?!

01:15:50.648 --> 01:15:54.443
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley!

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:58.363
That would be the French.

01:16:10.168 --> 01:16:11.377
Not more pirates!

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.461
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

01:16:14.423 --> 01:16:15.629
Mr. Gibbs?

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.632
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

01:16:18.759 --> 01:16:21.262
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:24.014
He fell behind.

01:16:31.563 --> 01:16:33.107
Keep to the code!

01:16:34.358 --> 01:16:37.151
- Weigh anchor!
- Hoist the sails!

01:16:37.235 --> 01:16:38.904
Split-quick, you dibbies!

01:16:45.118 --> 01:16:48.163
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:53.000
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

01:16:53.084 --> 01:16:55.463
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:59.465
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:16:59.507 --> 01:17:03.136
Ah, well, I won't be
making that mistake...

01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:04.388
...again.

01:17:05.181 --> 01:17:08.641
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:09.934
Aye.

01:17:10.687 --> 01:17:11.687
Kill him.

01:17:12.855 --> 01:17:15.522
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

01:17:18.194 --> 01:17:19.360
Hold your fire!

01:17:25.992 --> 01:17:28.536
You know whose blood we need?

01:17:30.248 --> 01:17:32.122
I know whose blood you need.

01:17:39.257 --> 01:17:41.839
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.176
A pirate.

01:17:44.343 --> 01:17:45.680
Here.

01:17:45.764 --> 01:17:47.472
Let me.

01:17:47.515 --> 01:17:49.016
Thank you.

01:17:50.393 --> 01:17:52.977
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

01:17:54.855 --> 01:17:55.855
Why?

01:17:59.192 --> 01:18:00.483
I don't know.

01:18:02.446 --> 01:18:04.656
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

01:18:04.699 --> 01:18:09.286
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

01:18:11.746 --> 01:18:13.539
But don't stop.

01:18:22.048 --> 01:18:23.465
Elizabeth!

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.734
It's yours.

01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:48.575
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:50.075
It was a gift from my father.

01:18:50.118 --> 01:18:52.245
He sent it to me.

01:18:57.918 --> 01:18:59.460
Why did you take it?

01:19:01.588 --> 01:19:04.340
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

01:19:05.925 --> 01:19:07.718
That would've been awful.

01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:12.973
It wasn't your blood they needed.

01:19:15.769 --> 01:19:18.021
It was my father's blood.

01:19:20.482 --> 01:19:23.067
My blood.

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:29.365
The blood of a pirate.

01:19:29.449 --> 01:19:31.575
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

01:19:44.924 --> 01:19:48.550
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

01:19:48.635 --> 01:19:53.972
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

01:19:54.057 --> 01:19:55.224
No.

01:19:55.308 --> 01:19:59.436
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

01:19:59.479 --> 01:20:01.564
watching me sail away on my ship,

01:20:01.649 --> 01:20:04.525
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

01:20:04.609 --> 01:20:05.943
Savvy?

01:20:05.985 --> 01:20:09.029
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

01:20:09.114 --> 01:20:12.950
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

01:20:13.992 --> 01:20:15.327
Of the two of us,

01:20:15.412 --> 01:20:19.206
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:23.292
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

01:20:23.335 --> 01:20:25.088
Although...

01:20:25.172 --> 01:20:27.798
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:30.133
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

01:20:31.176 --> 01:20:35.473
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

01:20:35.516 --> 01:20:36.890
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

01:20:36.974 --> 01:20:38.307
Hm.

01:20:40.895 --> 01:20:43.396
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

01:20:56.536 --> 01:20:58.578
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

01:20:59.246 --> 01:21:01.038
What say we run up a flag of truce,

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:02.916
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.462
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:10.924
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

01:21:11.009 --> 01:21:13.927
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.305
Lock him in the brig.

01:21:28.567 --> 01:21:31.026
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

01:21:31.068 --> 01:21:34.363
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

01:21:34.406 --> 01:21:36.866
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

01:21:36.909 --> 01:21:38.116
She's gaining on us!

01:21:42.707 --> 01:21:45.083
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:47.920
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

01:21:47.962 --> 01:21:49.879
We're shallower on the draft, right?

01:21:49.922 --> 01:21:50.923
Aye.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:53.089
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

01:21:54.552 --> 01:21:56.260
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

01:21:56.303 --> 01:21:57.597
Just long enough.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.930
Lighten the ship!

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.181
Stem to stern!

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:03.352
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

01:22:12.778 --> 01:22:14.780
Apparently, there's a leak.

01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:32.631
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

01:22:32.674 --> 01:22:34.882
And run out the sweeps.

01:23:03.119 --> 01:23:04.787
We're gonna need that.

01:23:13.464 --> 01:23:16.257
It was a good plan, up till now.

01:23:16.342 --> 01:23:17.800
Gibbs!

01:23:17.843 --> 01:23:19.260
We have to make a stand.

01:23:19.344 --> 01:23:20.762
We must fight!

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.806
- Load the guns!
- With what?

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.600
Anything! Everything!

01:23:25.684 --> 01:23:27.393
Anything we have left!

01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:31.397
Load the guns!

01:23:31.481 --> 01:23:33.190
Case shot and langrage!

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:34.859
Nails and crushed glass!

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:38.572
With a will!

01:23:59.884 --> 01:24:02.720
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:05.389
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:07.516
Lower the anchor on the right side.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.518
On the starboard side!

01:24:10.563 --> 01:24:13.690
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

01:24:13.733 --> 01:24:14.732
You both are!

01:24:14.815 --> 01:24:16.233
Daft like Jack!

01:24:16.944 --> 01:24:18.444
Lower the starboard anchor!

01:24:19.072 --> 01:24:22.614
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

01:24:22.698 --> 01:24:24.241
Aye!

01:24:41.093 --> 01:24:42.343
Let go!

01:24:48.935 --> 01:24:50.601
They're club haulin'!

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:53.436
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:55.272
Hard a port!

01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:07.910
Keep her steady, man.

01:25:14.959 --> 01:25:15.959
Now!

01:25:16.043 --> 01:25:18.337
Fire!

01:25:28.097 --> 01:25:30.098
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

01:26:16.687 --> 01:26:18.856
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.523
It's your turn!

01:26:20.566 --> 01:26:22.358
We need us a devil's dowry!

01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:23.734
We'll give them her!

01:26:24.738 --> 01:26:26.237
She's not what they're after.

01:26:28.824 --> 01:26:30.158
The medallion!

01:26:52.263 --> 01:26:54.849
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

01:26:54.892 --> 01:26:57.644
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

01:26:57.728 --> 01:26:59.563
Prepare to board!

01:27:07.196 --> 01:27:08.402
Ahh!

01:27:33.889 --> 01:27:36.723
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

01:27:36.766 --> 01:27:39.060
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

01:27:39.103 --> 01:27:42.438
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

01:27:51.991 --> 01:27:54.410
Hey! Hey!

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:12.845
Hey! Below!

01:28:32.656 --> 01:28:34.157
Thanks very much.

01:28:37.493 --> 01:28:39.079
Ha-haa!

01:28:43.459 --> 01:28:46.084
Whoa!

01:28:47.547 --> 01:28:48.546
Jack!

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.715
Bloody empty!

01:29:07.648 --> 01:29:09.526
That's not very nice.

01:29:14.156 --> 01:29:15.364
Where is the medallion?

01:29:15.406 --> 01:29:16.492
Wretch!

01:29:18.243 --> 01:29:19.452
Ah...

01:29:19.536 --> 01:29:20.869
Where is dear William?

01:29:23.081 --> 01:29:24.331
Will!

01:29:26.542 --> 01:29:28.752
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

01:29:31.716 --> 01:29:32.840
Monkey!

01:29:39.515 --> 01:29:41.349
I can't move it!

01:29:42.725 --> 01:29:43.725
Will!

01:29:43.768 --> 01:29:44.894
Elizabeth!

01:29:44.936 --> 01:29:46.019
Will!

01:29:57.116 --> 01:29:59.241
Why, thank you, Jack.

01:29:59.325 --> 01:30:00.951
You're welcome.

01:30:01.035 --> 01:30:03.622
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:07.749
Gents! Our hope is restored!

01:30:07.834 --> 01:30:09.252
Yeah!

01:30:43.786 --> 01:30:47.789
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

01:30:47.874 --> 01:30:50.625
I'll have your guts for garters!

01:30:58.509 --> 01:30:59.926
Will!

01:30:59.969 --> 01:31:01.970
Stop it! Stop it!

01:31:02.847 --> 01:31:04.805
Welcome back, miss.

01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:07.641
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

01:31:07.684 --> 01:31:11.022
It holds fair now
that you return the favor!

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.316
No! No!

01:31:16.986 --> 01:31:18.071
Barbossa!

01:31:20.031 --> 01:31:21.032
Will.

01:31:23.826 --> 01:31:24.826
She goes free!

01:31:25.952 --> 01:31:27.663
What's in your head, boy?

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.332
She goes free.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.045
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:36.129
Don't do anything stupid!

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:40.342
You can't.

01:31:40.426 --> 01:31:41.842
I can.

01:31:43.555 --> 01:31:45.179
Like that.

01:31:46.226 --> 01:31:47.516
Who are you?

01:31:47.558 --> 01:31:49.060
No one! He's no one!

01:31:49.811 --> 01:31:52.813
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

01:31:52.855 --> 01:31:55.357
- Lovely singing voice, though.
- Eunuch!

01:31:55.399 --> 01:31:57.066
My name is Will Turner!

01:31:57.150 --> 01:31:59.861
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

01:31:59.904 --> 01:32:01.864
His blood runs in my veins.

01:32:02.574 --> 01:32:04.866
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

01:32:04.951 --> 01:32:06.742
come back to haunt us!

01:32:06.827 --> 01:32:08.830
On my word, do as I say,

01:32:08.872 --> 01:32:10.747
or I'll pull this trigger,

01:32:10.832 --> 01:32:13.040
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

01:32:14.084 --> 01:32:16.378
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.587
Elizabeth goes free!

01:32:17.673 --> 01:32:19.297
Yes, we know that one.

01:32:19.382 --> 01:32:20.382
Anything else?

01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:24.345
And the crew!

01:32:24.388 --> 01:32:26.346
The crew are not to be harmed!

01:32:31.103 --> 01:32:32.893
Agreed.

01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:42.571
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

01:32:52.081 --> 01:32:53.749
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:56.418
You swore she'd go free!

01:32:56.502 --> 01:32:58.754
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy!

01:32:58.838 --> 01:33:00.504
I agreed she'd go free.

01:33:00.589 --> 01:33:03.592
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

01:33:09.307 --> 01:33:13.268
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

01:33:13.311 --> 01:33:14.311
Aye.

01:33:15.313 --> 01:33:18.481
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

01:33:22.819 --> 01:33:24.947
I always liked you.

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:30.285
Goes with your black heart!

01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:33.037
Mm. It's still warm.

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:38.460
Off you go!

01:33:38.543 --> 01:33:39.878
Come on!

01:33:43.507 --> 01:33:44.673
Too long!

01:33:55.811 --> 01:33:58.312
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

01:33:59.899 --> 01:34:01.315
Jack.

01:34:01.358 --> 01:34:02.443
Jack!

01:34:04.194 --> 01:34:05.654
Did ya not notice?

01:34:05.738 --> 01:34:09.990
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

01:34:11.284 --> 01:34:12.952
I did notice.

01:34:12.994 --> 01:34:17.164
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

01:34:17.207 --> 01:34:18.833
but I doubt it.

01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:23.212
Off you go.

01:34:24.214 --> 01:34:26.840
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

01:34:26.925 --> 01:34:28.509
By the powers, you're right!

01:34:28.592 --> 01:34:30.721
Where be Jack's pistol?

01:34:30.805 --> 01:34:31.972
Bring it forward.

01:34:35.142 --> 01:34:37.936
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

01:34:38.645 --> 01:34:40.438
...would give us a pair of pistols.

01:34:40.523 --> 01:34:42.231
It'll be one pistol, as before,

01:34:42.315 --> 01:34:45.108
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

01:34:45.192 --> 01:34:47.028
and starve to death yourself!

01:35:11.386 --> 01:35:14.930
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

01:35:17.393 --> 01:35:20.060
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

01:35:20.144 --> 01:35:21.730
We can escape the same way!

01:35:21.772 --> 01:35:23.898
To what point and purpose, young missy?

01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:26.400
The Black Pearl is gone,

01:35:26.443 --> 01:35:29.903
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

01:35:29.988 --> 01:35:32.406
Unlikely...

01:35:32.449 --> 01:35:35.408
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

01:35:38.079 --> 01:35:40.414
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

01:35:40.457 --> 01:35:44.877
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

01:35:44.919 --> 01:35:47.672
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:50.007
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

01:35:52.552 --> 01:35:54.053
How did you escape last time?

01:36:00.894 --> 01:36:02.769
Last time...

01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:05.605
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

01:36:06.608 --> 01:36:07.608
Last time...

01:36:09.652 --> 01:36:12.946
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

01:36:12.989 --> 01:36:15.448
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

01:36:15.532 --> 01:36:17.285
From the looks of things,

01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:19.578
they've long been out of business.

01:36:19.621 --> 01:36:24.750
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

01:36:24.793 --> 01:36:26.334
So that's it then?

01:36:27.628 --> 01:36:31.465
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

01:36:32.468 --> 01:36:34.259
You spent three days,

01:36:34.302 --> 01:36:36.637
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

01:36:39.016 --> 01:36:42.809
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.027
♪ We're devils
We're black sheep

01:36:53.112 --> 01:36:54.279
♪ We're really bad eggs

01:36:54.322 --> 01:36:56.948
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

01:36:56.991 --> 01:37:00.952
♪ Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

01:37:00.994 --> 01:37:02.830
I love this song!

01:37:05.833 --> 01:37:08.000
Really bad eggs!

01:37:09.421 --> 01:37:11.422
Ooh...

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.882
When I get the Pearl back,

01:37:14.966 --> 01:37:17.468
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

01:37:17.511 --> 01:37:19.054
and we'll sing it all the time!

01:37:19.139 --> 01:37:22.932
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

01:37:23.016 --> 01:37:24.851
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

01:37:25.895 --> 01:37:27.603
The entire ocean!

01:37:27.688 --> 01:37:29.440
The entire world!

01:37:30.357 --> 01:37:32.358
Wherever we want to go, we go.

01:37:32.401 --> 01:37:33.985
That's what a ship is, you know.

01:37:34.027 --> 01:37:36.864
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

01:37:36.948 --> 01:37:38.449
That's what a ship needs.

01:37:38.533 --> 01:37:40.534
But what a ship is...

01:37:41.911 --> 01:37:44.871
What the Black Pearl really is...

01:37:46.332 --> 01:37:49.584
...is freedom.

01:37:50.585 --> 01:37:51.670
Jack...

01:37:51.713 --> 01:37:56.467
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

01:37:57.258 --> 01:37:58.469
Oh, yes.

01:37:58.553 --> 01:38:01.389
But the company is...

01:38:01.432 --> 01:38:04.224
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

01:38:06.018 --> 01:38:09.729
...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr. Sparrow!

01:38:09.771 --> 01:38:13.817
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

01:38:15.444 --> 01:38:17.237
I know exactly what you mean, love.

01:38:24.745 --> 01:38:26.289
To freedom!

01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:30.583
To the Black Pearl.

01:38:47.184 --> 01:38:50.228
Hm?

01:39:00.113 --> 01:39:01.199
No!

01:39:01.283 --> 01:39:04.076
Not good! Stop!

01:39:04.117 --> 01:39:05.326
Not good!

01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:06.410
What are you doing?

01:39:06.453 --> 01:39:08.539
You've burned all the food, the shade...

01:39:08.623 --> 01:39:10.874
...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

01:39:10.959 --> 01:39:12.207
Why is the rum gone?

01:39:12.667 --> 01:39:14.543
One, because it is a vile drink

01:39:14.627 --> 01:39:17.548
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

01:39:17.632 --> 01:39:20.717
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

01:39:20.802 --> 01:39:23.010
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

01:39:23.095 --> 01:39:25.471
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

01:39:25.514 --> 01:39:26.681
they won't see it?

01:39:26.765 --> 01:39:28.598
But why is the rum gone?

01:39:29.685 --> 01:39:31.143
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

01:39:31.186 --> 01:39:32.981
You give it one hour, maybe two,

01:39:33.065 --> 01:39:37.983
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:46.492
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

01:39:46.535 --> 01:39:49.620
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

01:39:57.003 --> 01:39:59.254
There'll be no
living with her after this.

01:40:00.256 --> 01:40:03.842
- We've got to save Will!
- No! You're safe now.

01:40:03.926 --> 01:40:06.012
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

01:40:06.096 --> 01:40:08.056
not go gallivanting after pirates!

01:40:08.141 --> 01:40:10.058
Then we condemn him to death!

01:40:11.144 --> 01:40:13.852
The boy's fate is regrettable...

01:40:13.936 --> 01:40:16.522
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

01:40:16.607 --> 01:40:19.859
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

01:40:19.943 --> 01:40:23.780
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

01:40:23.865 --> 01:40:27.033
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

01:40:27.075 --> 01:40:29.993
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

01:40:30.036 --> 01:40:31.370
Think about it.

01:40:31.455 --> 01:40:33.664
The Black Pearl.

01:40:33.707 --> 01:40:38.210
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

01:40:38.253 --> 01:40:40.213
How can you pass that up?

01:40:42.382 --> 01:40:45.217
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow,

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:47.762
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

01:40:47.847 --> 01:40:48.845
Please do this!

01:40:48.888 --> 01:40:50.513
For me!

01:40:50.556 --> 01:40:52.725
As a wedding gift.

01:40:52.808 --> 01:40:53.975
Elizabeth?

01:40:55.062 --> 01:40:57.605
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

01:41:00.024 --> 01:41:01.067
I am.

01:41:01.902 --> 01:41:03.569
A wedding! I love weddings!

01:41:03.654 --> 01:41:05.404
Drinks all around!

01:41:07.698 --> 01:41:10.451
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

01:41:12.997 --> 01:41:14.162
Mr. Sparrow...

01:41:15.499 --> 01:41:17.833
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

01:41:17.919 --> 01:41:20.419
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

01:41:20.462 --> 01:41:24.382
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

01:41:24.424 --> 01:41:26.925
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

01:41:26.967 --> 01:41:28.550
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:28.593 --> 01:41:30.681
Inescapably clear.

01:41:34.685 --> 01:41:36.936
Shiver me timbers!

01:41:37.728 --> 01:41:39.355
Cotton says you missed a bit.

01:41:44.359 --> 01:41:45.735
You knew William Turner?

01:41:47.614 --> 01:41:49.699
Old Bootstrap Bill.

01:41:49.783 --> 01:41:50.783
We knew him.

01:41:51.784 --> 01:41:55.787
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:57.915
the mutiny and all.

01:41:58.498 --> 01:42:00.501
He said it wasn't right with the code.

01:42:01.585 --> 01:42:04.755
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

01:42:04.798 --> 01:42:08.425
He said we deserved to be cursed...

01:42:10.012 --> 01:42:12.096
...and remain cursed.

01:42:12.139 --> 01:42:13.179
Stupid blighter!

01:42:13.264 --> 01:42:15.097
Good man.

01:42:15.141 --> 01:42:20.396
But, as you can imagine, that
didn't sit too well with the captain.

01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:23.733
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

01:42:23.817 --> 01:42:27.444
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

01:42:29.989 --> 01:42:34.074
So... what the captain did...

01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:36.745
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

01:42:36.829 --> 01:42:38.330
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

01:42:38.373 --> 01:42:41.375
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.918
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

01:42:44.003 --> 01:42:47.131
of Davy Jones' locker!

01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:50.633
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

01:42:50.676 --> 01:42:51.885
to lift the curse.

01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:55.014
That's what you'd call ironic.

01:42:59.185 --> 01:43:00.811
Bring him!

01:43:08.026 --> 01:43:10.029
I don't care for the situation.

01:43:10.572 --> 01:43:13.656
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

01:43:13.699 --> 01:43:17.036
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.788
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

01:43:20.872 --> 01:43:23.708
You and your men
return to the Dauntless

01:43:23.751 --> 01:43:27.004
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

01:43:27.047 --> 01:43:28.296
What do you have to lose?

01:43:29.382 --> 01:43:31.885
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

01:43:33.552 --> 01:43:35.428
Now, to be quite honest with you,

01:43:35.513 --> 01:43:38.474
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

01:43:38.558 --> 01:43:42.352
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

01:43:42.394 --> 01:43:45.480
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

01:43:45.565 --> 01:43:46.564
I have to tell him!

01:43:46.607 --> 01:43:49.609
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

01:43:49.693 --> 01:43:52.237
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

01:43:52.279 --> 01:43:55.989
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

01:43:56.074 --> 01:43:58.158
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

01:44:09.631 --> 01:44:11.089
No reason to fret.

01:44:11.173 --> 01:44:13.758
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

01:44:13.801 --> 01:44:15.802
No mistakes this time.

01:44:15.886 --> 01:44:17.595
He's only half Turner.

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.097
We spill it all!

01:44:21.516 --> 01:44:24.435
Guess there is reason to fret.

01:44:37.282 --> 01:44:39.159
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

01:44:39.244 --> 01:44:41.286
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:44.080
By blood un...

01:44:46.458 --> 01:44:47.457
Jack!

01:44:48.502 --> 01:44:49.584
It's not possible!

01:44:49.626 --> 01:44:51.796
Not probable.

01:44:51.839 --> 01:44:53.632
Where's Elizabeth?

01:44:55.009 --> 01:44:57.259
She's safe, just like I promised.

01:44:57.302 --> 01:45:00.262
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

01:45:00.305 --> 01:45:02.681
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

01:45:02.765 --> 01:45:04.892
So we're all men of our word, really.

01:45:04.976 --> 01:45:08.271
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

01:45:08.314 --> 01:45:09.731
Shut up! You're next!

01:45:13.277 --> 01:45:16.154
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

01:45:16.196 --> 01:45:18.155
No, I really think I do.

01:45:19.949 --> 01:45:21.826
Your funeral.

01:45:24.997 --> 01:45:26.997
And why don't I want to be doing it?

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.708
Oh, because...

01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:32.044
Because the HMS Dauntless,

01:45:32.128 --> 01:45:34.546
the pride of the Royal Navy,

01:45:34.631 --> 01:45:37.883
is floating just off shore,

01:45:37.967 --> 01:45:39.801
waiting for you.

01:45:47.853 --> 01:45:49.020
What we doing here?

01:45:50.939 --> 01:45:54.358
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.486
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

01:45:56.528 --> 01:45:59.363
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

01:46:00.658 --> 01:46:03.034
I know why we're here. I meant...

01:46:03.118 --> 01:46:04.993
...why aren't we doing what it was...

01:46:05.036 --> 01:46:06.869
What Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

01:46:06.912 --> 01:46:08.414
With the cannons and all?

01:46:08.499 --> 01:46:11.541
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

01:46:14.169 --> 01:46:16.755
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

01:46:16.839 --> 01:46:18.716
Just hear me out, mate.

01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:22.552
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

01:46:23.639 --> 01:46:28.058
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

01:46:28.142 --> 01:46:30.560
The makings of your very own fleet.

01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:34.232
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

01:46:34.316 --> 01:46:35.732
But what of the Pearl?

01:46:37.359 --> 01:46:38.695
Name me captain.

01:46:38.737 --> 01:46:42.196
I'll sail under your colors,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

01:46:42.239 --> 01:46:44.448
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

01:46:45.033 --> 01:46:47.911
...Commodore Barbossa.

01:46:47.954 --> 01:46:49.037
Savvy?

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.289
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

01:46:51.373 --> 01:46:54.209
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

01:46:54.252 --> 01:46:55.919
By all means, kill the whelp!

01:46:55.962 --> 01:46:58.380
Just not yet.

01:46:58.423 --> 01:47:00.591
Wait to lift the curse

01:47:00.633 --> 01:47:03.301
until the opportune moment.

01:47:06.764 --> 01:47:08.391
For instance...

01:47:10.268 --> 01:47:13.520
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

01:47:13.604 --> 01:47:15.188
Every...

01:47:15.273 --> 01:47:16.940
...last...

01:47:16.983 --> 01:47:18.443
...one.

01:47:28.078 --> 01:47:30.412
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:32.039
Ever since you learned my name!

01:47:32.874 --> 01:47:33.873
Yeah.

01:47:36.208 --> 01:47:38.336
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

01:47:38.422 --> 01:47:39.421
- 15!
- 40!

01:47:39.464 --> 01:47:40.465
25!

01:47:41.632 --> 01:47:42.966
And I'll buy you the hat.

01:47:43.009 --> 01:47:45.010
A really big one.

01:47:45.803 --> 01:47:46.971
Commodore.

01:47:50.099 --> 01:47:51.307
We have an accord.

01:47:52.978 --> 01:47:55.270
All hands to the boats!

01:47:56.273 --> 01:47:57.397
Apologies.

01:47:57.482 --> 01:47:59.149
You give the orders.

01:48:00.486 --> 01:48:01.485
Gents...

01:48:02.488 --> 01:48:03.861
...take a walk!

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.035
Not to the boats?

01:49:09.429 --> 01:49:12.347
Hold fire!

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:17.184
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

01:49:18.563 --> 01:49:20.188
'Cept they was in a horse,

01:49:20.231 --> 01:49:21.690
instead of dresses.

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.774
Wooden horse.

01:49:36.746 --> 01:49:37.747
A moment, please.

01:49:41.919 --> 01:49:42.917
Elizabeth?

01:49:46.173 --> 01:49:47.965
I just want you to know, I...

01:49:49.092 --> 01:49:51.552
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

01:49:52.386 --> 01:49:54.389
Couldn't be more proud of you!

01:49:54.891 --> 01:49:56.016
But, you know,

01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.018
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

01:49:59.102 --> 01:50:00.604
can be a wrong decision.

01:50:09.615 --> 01:50:10.613
Lieutenant.

01:50:17.537 --> 01:50:19.955
Yoo-hoo.

01:50:29.799 --> 01:50:30.967
Elizabeth?

01:50:33.136 --> 01:50:34.386
Are you there?

01:50:36.639 --> 01:50:39.266
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:08.463
Oh, what have you done?

01:51:08.506 --> 01:51:12.091
- Yoo-hoo.
- Stop that! I already feel like a fool!

01:51:13.134 --> 01:51:15.636
Look nice, though.

01:51:19.015 --> 01:51:21.433
Do I look nice now?!

01:51:57.387 --> 01:51:58.637
I must admit, Jack.

01:51:58.722 --> 01:52:00.639
I thought I had you figured.

01:52:00.724 --> 01:52:03.892
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

01:52:03.977 --> 01:52:05.935
Me, I'm dishonest.

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.857
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

01:52:08.899 --> 01:52:10.149
Honestly...

01:52:10.233 --> 01:52:12.859
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

01:52:12.901 --> 01:52:15.194
'Cause you can never predict

01:52:15.237 --> 01:52:18.532
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

01:52:18.575 --> 01:52:19.574
...stupid.

01:52:37.217 --> 01:52:38.384
Ha-ha!

01:52:38.427 --> 01:52:39.469
Ha-ha!

01:52:39.553 --> 01:52:40.888
Ha!

01:52:52.734 --> 01:52:54.942
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

01:52:55.027 --> 01:52:57.070
Here, there be monsters!

01:53:04.954 --> 01:53:07.037
What would you pick to eat first?

01:53:07.121 --> 01:53:09.041
I think we should decide now,

01:53:09.125 --> 01:53:11.293
just so we're ready when the time comes!

01:53:36.362 --> 01:53:37.485
What was that?

01:53:41.989 --> 01:53:43.033
Oh.

01:53:55.713 --> 01:53:57.963
Shh!

01:54:00.426 --> 01:54:01.426
It's Elizabeth!

01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:23.699
Make for the ship! Move!

01:54:27.871 --> 01:54:29.286
Ahh!

01:54:33.125 --> 01:54:34.917
To the ship!

01:54:37.714 --> 01:54:40.841
Marines, arms!

01:55:17.294 --> 01:55:19.045
You can't beat me, Jack.

01:55:43.319 --> 01:55:44.862
That's interesting!

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.624
I couldn't resist, mate.

01:56:19.690 --> 01:56:21.941
Oh, no.

01:57:04.025 --> 01:57:05.233
Sorry!

01:57:14.328 --> 01:57:15.995
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

01:57:16.038 --> 01:57:18.706
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:21.124
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:22.208
Hm?

01:57:22.251 --> 01:57:23.669
Or you could surrender.

01:57:32.429 --> 01:57:35.764
Ahh!

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.683
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

01:57:50.988 --> 01:57:52.197
All of you with me!

01:57:52.239 --> 01:57:54.324
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

01:57:54.408 --> 01:57:56.993
Ready, and... heave!

01:58:03.584 --> 01:58:05.585
Please, I need your help! Come on!

01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:08.421
Any port in a storm.

01:58:08.506 --> 01:58:10.591
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

01:58:10.675 --> 01:58:12.926
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

01:58:13.009 --> 01:58:14.803
Jack owes us a ship!

01:58:14.886 --> 01:58:16.430
There's the code to consider.

01:58:17.016 --> 01:58:18.139
The code?

01:58:19.893 --> 01:58:22.351
You're pirates!
Hang the code

01:58:22.435 --> 01:58:24.105
and hang the rules!

01:58:24.147 --> 01:58:26.565
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:32.530
Bloody pirates!

01:58:42.124 --> 01:58:43.872
- Oi!
- What?

01:58:43.957 --> 01:58:46.126
Is it supposed to be doing that?

01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:48.420
They're stealing our ship!

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.546
Bloody pirates!

01:58:52.634 --> 01:58:54.469
Boarders away!

01:59:02.684 --> 01:59:04.685
Come on!

01:59:29.879 --> 01:59:31.920
No! Me eye!

01:59:33.007 --> 01:59:34.715
No!

01:59:49.023 --> 01:59:50.564
Ha!

01:59:51.858 --> 01:59:53.942
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

01:59:54.027 --> 01:59:55.570
You like pain?

01:59:57.406 --> 01:59:58.782
Try wearing a corset.

02:00:09.167 --> 02:00:10.794
Whose side is Jack on?

02:00:10.878 --> 02:00:13.923
At the moment?

02:00:48.123 --> 02:00:49.998
No fair!

02:01:14.023 --> 02:01:15.858
Ten years you carry that pistol,

02:01:15.942 --> 02:01:18.277
and now you waste your shot!

02:01:19.279 --> 02:01:22.239
He didn't waste it.

02:01:46.890 --> 02:01:48.391
I feel...

02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.272
...cold.

02:02:24.385 --> 02:02:27.388
Oh... Ugh! Oh!

02:02:56.541 --> 02:02:59.001
Parley?

02:02:59.044 --> 02:03:00.922
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

02:03:01.006 --> 02:03:03.383
Huzzah! Huzzah!

02:03:12.183 --> 02:03:15.061
Huzzah!

02:03:49.261 --> 02:03:51.596
We should return to the Dauntless.

02:03:54.143 --> 02:03:57.769
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

02:04:07.448 --> 02:04:10.741
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

02:04:11.742 --> 02:04:13.076
...that was it.

02:04:14.536 --> 02:04:16.705
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

02:04:16.789 --> 02:04:19.624
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

02:04:24.213 --> 02:04:26.381
I'm sorry, Jack.

02:04:28.301 --> 02:04:30.509
They done what's right by them.

02:04:30.594 --> 02:04:32.346
Can't expect more than that.

02:04:47.945 --> 02:04:49.278
Jack Sparrow!

02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:53.408
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:04:54.118 --> 02:04:57.370
...For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

02:04:57.454 --> 02:05:01.166
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:02.792
and sinister in nature.

02:05:03.461 --> 02:05:04.960
The most egregious of these

02:05:05.003 --> 02:05:07.214
to be cited herewith:

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:11.050
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

02:05:12.052 --> 02:05:15.054
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

02:05:15.138 --> 02:05:17.681
as are we all.

02:05:17.724 --> 02:05:20.434
...Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

02:05:20.519 --> 02:05:23.605
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:24.813
Oh, yes!

02:05:24.855 --> 02:05:26.857
Sailing under false colors,

02:05:26.942 --> 02:05:31.153
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

02:05:31.197 --> 02:05:37.159
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

02:05:37.202 --> 02:05:38.995
and general lawlessness.

02:05:40.412 --> 02:05:42.082
And for these crimes,

02:05:42.166 --> 02:05:44.708
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

02:05:44.752 --> 02:05:48.505
hung by the neck, until dead.

02:05:48.548 --> 02:05:50.841
May God have mercy on your soul.

02:05:50.883 --> 02:05:52.424
Governor Swann.

02:05:52.509 --> 02:05:54.428
Commodore.

02:05:55.929 --> 02:05:56.929
Elizabeth.

02:05:58.390 --> 02:06:01.226
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:05.563
I love you.

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:21.872
Oi, watch yourself!

02:06:21.914 --> 02:06:23.039
Marines!

02:06:23.082 --> 02:06:24.623
I can't breathe!

02:06:26.419 --> 02:06:27.458
Elizabeth!

02:06:30.547 --> 02:06:31.590
Move!

02:06:32.465 --> 02:06:34.757
Goodness sake!

02:06:42.475 --> 02:06:44.684
You men! With me!

02:06:55.947 --> 02:06:57.114
Move!

02:07:06.874 --> 02:07:08.459
Come on!

02:07:18.554 --> 02:07:19.677
Come on, men!

02:07:45.289 --> 02:07:49.290
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

02:07:50.126 --> 02:07:51.709
But not from you.

02:07:51.794 --> 02:07:55.631
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

02:07:55.674 --> 02:07:57.340
And this is how you thank me?

02:07:57.383 --> 02:07:59.467
By throwing in your lot with him?

02:07:59.510 --> 02:08:01.094
He's a pirate!

02:08:01.179 --> 02:08:03.139
And a good man.

02:08:03.931 --> 02:08:06.183
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

02:08:06.226 --> 02:08:08.352
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

02:08:08.436 --> 02:08:10.062
so be it.

02:08:10.146 --> 02:08:12.022
At least my conscience will be clear.

02:08:12.065 --> 02:08:15.026
You forget your place, Turner.

02:08:16.568 --> 02:08:18.195
It's right here,

02:08:18.238 --> 02:08:19.697
between you and Jack.

02:08:23.703 --> 02:08:25.369
As is mine.

02:08:25.453 --> 02:08:26.828
Elizabeth!

02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:29.454
Lower your weapons.

02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:32.250
For goodness sake, put them down!

02:08:37.341 --> 02:08:40.260
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

02:08:41.885 --> 02:08:43.387
It is.

02:08:51.894 --> 02:08:55.524
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

02:08:55.567 --> 02:08:58.109
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place, eh?

02:08:58.193 --> 02:08:59.486
- Oh.
- Spiritually.

02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:01.571
Ecumenically.

02:09:01.656 --> 02:09:03.740
Grammatically.

02:09:04.324 --> 02:09:06.908
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

02:09:08.204 --> 02:09:09.204
Know that.

02:09:13.209 --> 02:09:14.710
Elizabeth.

02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:19.255
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

02:09:20.716 --> 02:09:22.593
I'm sorry.

02:09:24.721 --> 02:09:25.721
Will!

02:09:28.016 --> 02:09:29.683
Nice hat.

02:09:31.644 --> 02:09:33.227
Friends!

02:09:35.147 --> 02:09:37.941
This the day that you will always

02:09:37.984 --> 02:09:40.611
remember as the day that...

02:09:45.575 --> 02:09:48.242
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

02:09:50.663 --> 02:09:52.498
Sail ho!

02:10:00.049 --> 02:10:02.675
What's your plan of action?

02:10:03.425 --> 02:10:04.425
Sir?

02:10:08.807 --> 02:10:11.264
Perhaps on the rare occasion

02:10:11.307 --> 02:10:15.187
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

02:10:15.271 --> 02:10:19.066
piracy itself can be the right course?

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.613
Mr. Turner!

02:10:30.703 --> 02:10:33.538
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

02:10:39.503 --> 02:10:41.129
This is a beautiful sword.

02:10:43.590 --> 02:10:45.341
I would expect the man who made it

02:10:45.384 --> 02:10:50.180
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

02:10:52.224 --> 02:10:53.976
Thank you.

02:10:56.854 --> 02:10:57.894
Commodore!

02:10:57.979 --> 02:10:59.690
What about Sparrow?

02:11:01.607 --> 02:11:04.526
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

02:11:11.033 --> 02:11:12.703
So...

02:11:13.786 --> 02:11:16.873
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

02:11:18.249 --> 02:11:20.541
After all...

02:11:20.584 --> 02:11:22.129
...he is a blacksmith.

02:11:23.130 --> 02:11:24.381
No.

02:11:29.094 --> 02:11:31.388
He's a pirate.

02:11:56.412 --> 02:11:58.079
Heave!

02:12:07.632 --> 02:12:10.217
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code, eh?

02:12:10.259 --> 02:12:12.928
We figured they were more actual...

02:12:13.012 --> 02:12:14.972
...guidelines.

02:12:19.102 --> 02:12:20.811
Thank you.

02:12:21.938 --> 02:12:23.314
Captain Sparrow.

02:12:27.610 --> 02:12:29.194
The Black Pearl is yours!

02:12:45.002 --> 02:12:46.629
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

02:12:46.713 --> 02:12:48.381
Hands to braces!

02:12:48.465 --> 02:12:50.549
Let go and haul to run free.

02:12:52.219 --> 02:12:54.011
Now...

02:12:54.096 --> 02:12:55.930
Bring me that horizon.

02:13:03.228 --> 02:13:05.314
♪ ...And really bad eggs

02:13:08.652 --> 02:13:11.153
