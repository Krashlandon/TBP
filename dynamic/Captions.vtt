00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:42.683

Hour and a half, maybe.

like that for?

- I don't know.
- What?

(GARRY) Where'd they take these shots?

00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:36.195
Seems like they were spending
a lot of their time

00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:38.989
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles.

00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.490
(GARRY) What's that?

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:44.536
(MACREADY) It looks like something
buried under the ice.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.004
(NORRIS) And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:58.300
(GARRY) Whatever it was, it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:11.939
Here. This is it. The place where
they were spending most of their time.

00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:15.567
- Pretty nasty out, Mac. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

Half a mile due east.

00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:22.361
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:27.157
Well, the backscatter effect's been
bringing things up

00:39:27.657 --> 00:39:30.285
from way down around here for a long time.

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:34.998
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried in is
100,000 years old, at least.

00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:40.587
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:11.535
I don't know.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.080
Thousands of years ago, it crashes,
and this thing...

00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:20.127
gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.921

all about it. Right, Mac?

00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:34.975
Do you believe
any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair?

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:39.396
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.

00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:42.524
They practically own South America.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:45.360
I mean, they taught the Incas
everything they know.

00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:54.035
So, come on, now, MacReady.

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.539
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.083
Yes, Garry, they dig it up. They cart it back.

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:03.503
It gets thawed out, wakes up,
probably not in the best of moods.

in the kitchen trash can, huh?

I want my kitchen clean, germfree.

after thousands of years in the ice?

- Outside.

00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:22.898
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one who knows this organism.

00:57:22.982 --> 00:57:24.316
He's too far gone.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.653
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start going through them.

00:57:39.999 --> 00:57:42.543
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:47.840
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.049
What?

00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:51.760
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

00:57:52.261 --> 00:57:55.931
- Wait a minute. Was this broken into?
- The lock is undamaged.

00:57:56.265 --> 00:57:58.601
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.

00:57:58.684 --> 00:57:59.727
Great.

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.729
Who's got access to it?

00:58:06.442 --> 00:58:08.444
I guess I'm the only one.

00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:10.654
And I got the only key.

00:58:14.492 --> 00:58:18.037
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- I think so, yes.

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.039
(NORRIS) Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:23.125
Well, who else could've used that key?

00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:27.004
Nobody! I just give it to Copper
whenever he needs it.

00:58:27.463 --> 00:58:29.840
Could anybody have gotten it from you,
Doc?

00:58:29.924 --> 00:58:33.928
I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.

00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:36.639
Great.

00:58:38.182 --> 00:58:41.977
- (FUCHS) When was the last time you used it?
- (DOC) Day or so ago, I guess.

00:58:43.771 --> 00:58:46.398
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me...

00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:47.650
Oh, come on!

00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:50.069
That key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt.

00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:51.403
(BOTH YELLING)

00:58:51.487 --> 00:58:53.280
Accusing everybody...

00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:55.783
(MACREADY) Stop it! It ain't worth it!

00:58:55.908 --> 00:58:57.409
Copper's the only one
who's got any business with it.

00:58:57.493 --> 00:59:00.079
Now wait a minute, Garry!
You've been in here on several occasions.

00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:01.580
Doc thought of the test.

00:59:01.664 --> 00:59:04.041
(CHILDS) So what?
Is that supposed to clear him?

00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:05.292
(BOTH YELLING)

00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:07.336

(PANTING)

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.976
Put that down!

00:59:22.685 --> 00:59:25.521
- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.

00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.066
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

00:59:29.149 --> 00:59:32.361
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those things.

00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:33.696
Windows.

00:59:34.947 --> 00:59:37.825
Wait a minute. Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.578
Put it down.
You don't want to hurt anybody.

00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:41.662
Right.

00:59:41.954 --> 00:59:43.414
(GARRY) On the floor.

00:59:58.178 --> 00:59:59.847
It's on the floor.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.647
I don't know about Copper,

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:13.235
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.829
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:28.167
if somebody else was in charge.

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:32.463
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.510
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.

01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:41.597
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:46.226
It should be somebody
a little more even-tempered, Childs.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.613
(MACREADY) All right.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.951
(WIND HOWLING)

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.429
(MACREADY) I know I'm human.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.520
And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.897
So some of you are still human.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:37.528
This thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.864
It'll fight if it has to.

01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:43.492
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.495
If it takes us over,

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.290
then it has no more enemies,

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.252
nobody left to kill it.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.004
And then it's won.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:02.344
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.013
We're gonna find out who's who.

01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:09.935
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:24.283
Norris, you and Childs
shoot them up with morphine.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.993
Tie them down in the rec room
and watch them.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.745
Fuchs, you start working
on a new technique.

01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:30.372
- I need Doc's help.
- You don't wanna drug me.

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:32.833
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:56.815
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.

01:02:56.899 --> 01:02:59.443
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:11.622
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:15.876
If none of us make it,
at least there'll be some kind of record.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.254
Storm's been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours.

01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:22.508
We still have nothing to go on.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:38.565
One other thing,
I think it rips through your clothes

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.567
when it takes you over.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:45.572
Windows found some shredded long johns,
but the name tag was missing.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:48.575
They could be anybody's.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.245
Nobody...

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.999
Nobody trusts anybody now.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.920
And we're all very tired.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.179

anybody now.'

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.727
There's nothing else I can do.

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:17.729
Just wait.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.778
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost, number 31.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.129
You come up with anything yet?

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.172
One or two ideas.

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:50.387
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:54.433
If a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism,

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.602
then everyone should prepare
their own meals.

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:59.271
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.024
All right.

01:05:32.888 --> 01:05:33.889

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.264
Anybody see Fuchs?

01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:21.269
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:24.898
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.733
All right, we gotta find him.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.903
Nauls, why don't you come with me
and we'll look outside.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:32.406
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:34.741
I ain't going with Windows.

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.787
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.373
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.793
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.340
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:53.802
Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

in 20 minutes regardless.

you're with. Real close.

I don't wanna stay out here anymore.
I wanna come back inside.

It ain't Fuchs.

I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

I'd like to come back inside.

don't you understand?

I'm all right. I'm much better
and I won't harm anybody.

Yeah.

Maybe he burned himself

- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.

I found this.

Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.780
Wind must've dislodged it,
but I don't think he saw me find it.

I made sure I got ahead of him
on the towline on the way back.

Damn it! He's got the keys!

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.600
(MACREADY) What's going on?
The towline snapped.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:37.145
Bullshit, Childs.
He's got to know damn well I cut it!

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:41.733
You're a dead man, MacReady!

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.987
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:58.708
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.961
Come on, Childs, burn me.

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:06.424
Put those torches on the floor and back off.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:17.268
Back off. Way off.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.781
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.658
Don't argue with him.

01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:34.536
Where's the rest?

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:40.792
Come on, man, I mean it!

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.044
It's cool, MacReady, come on.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.296
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:49.259
Anybody touches me... and we go.

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:55.515
(GROANS)

01:14:02.272 --> 01:14:05.358
- He's not breathing!
- Go untie the doc.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.321
Get him in here. And bring the others.

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:16.244
From now on, nobody gets out of my sight.

01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:27.088
Let me at him.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:36.848
So, you sweethearts were about to have
a little lynching party, huh?

01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:42.020
I might just have to put an end to you
on general principles, Nauls.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:45.190
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody
could've gotten some of my clothes

01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:48.193
- and stuck them up the furnace?
- (CHILDS) We ain't buying that.

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:52.363
Quit that bickering over there!
Windows, wheel that defibrillator over here.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.741
Give me those paddles!

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:57.660
(CHILDS) You're gonna have to
sleep sometime, MacReady.

01:14:57.785 --> 01:15:00.455
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

01:15:02.624 --> 01:15:05.126
If anyone tries to wake me...

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:10.298
Clear!

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.807
- Clear!
- Clear.

01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:21.643
(SCREAMING)

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:22.370
- We're on fire, MacReady! We're on fire!
- Get back! Just wait!

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.088
All right, go!

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.403
Windows! Windows, get in here!

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:24.098
You gotta be fucking kidding.

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:39.113
(SCREECHING)

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.371
- What do you got in mind, MacReady?
- A little test.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:50.667
And, Windows, you and Palmer,
tie everybody down real tight.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.377
- What for?
- For your health.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.129
Let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:01.594
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.347
Let's do what Mac says.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.893
I mean,
he wasted Norris pretty quick, didn't he?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:10.520
That's close enough, Clark.

01:18:10.645 --> 01:18:11.979
He ain't tying me up.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.982
Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.901
Then kill me.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.537
I mean it.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:32.083
(GUN COCKING)

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:36.295
I guess you do.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.214
(GUN FIRING)

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.435
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:53.146
- (MACREADY) Finish it, Palmer.
- They're dead, Mac!

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:00.111
- Windows?
- Yo?

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:03.990
You tie up Palmer over here.

01:19:08.286 --> 01:19:11.414
(MACREADY) We're gonna draw
a little bit of everybody's blood

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.586
'cause we're gonna find out
who's the thing.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.090
Watching Norris in there
gave me the idea that

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.635
maybe every part of him was a whole.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.223
Every little piece was an individual animal

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:32.852
with a built-in desire to protect its own life.

01:19:35.313 --> 01:19:37.398
You see, when a man bleeds,

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.194
it's just tissue.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:47.200
The blood from one of you things
won't obey when it's attacked.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.577
It'll try and survive.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.081
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.313
Now you.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.547
That's good.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:45.591
All right, move back, over there.

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:34.932
I guess you're okay.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.146
All right. Put that on and watch them.

01:21:49.989 --> 01:21:52.617
Now I'll show you what I already know.

01:21:57.622 --> 01:21:59.457
It's a crock of shit.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.376
Let's try the doc and Clark.

01:22:20.478 --> 01:22:21.812
Now Clark.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:33.282
Then Clark was human, huh?

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:36.953
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:38.621
Palmer now.

01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:48.422
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.008
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.386
You were the only one that could've
got to that blood.

01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:55.262
We'll do you last.

Childs.

We're going out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here

01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:59.006

How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

(NAULS) Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:47.489
(MACREADY) Blair's been busy out here
all by himself.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:58.792
What is it?

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.086
Something he's been making.

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.172
It's a ship of some kind.

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:06.633
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:09.636
The smart S.O.B. put it together
piece by piece.

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.432
Where was he trying to go?

I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:11.865
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.420
Got a flare?

01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:30.050
He got back inside and blew the generator.

01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:34.972
In six hours,
it'll be a hundred below in here.

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.974
Well, that's suicide!

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.603
Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now.

01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:43.897
It's got no way out of here.

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:47.443
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it.

What can we do? What can we do?

Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

a little around here.

and got lost in the storm.

If we've got any surprises for each other,

01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:04.642
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:12.567
Well... What do we do?

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:15.653
Why don't we just

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:19.532
wait here for a little while?
