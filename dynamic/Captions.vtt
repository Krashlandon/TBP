00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.768
An evil old house,
the kind some people call haunted...

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:24.314
...is like an undiscovered country
waiting to be explored.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:29.319
Hill House had stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:34.033
Silence lay steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
And whatever walked there walked alone.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.426
Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:19.054
The history of Hill House was ideal.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:22.224
It had everything I wanted.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.060
It was built 90-odd, very odd, years ago...

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.605
...by a man named Hugh Crain
as a home for his wife and daughter...

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:31.150
...in the most remote part of New England
he could find.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.615
It was an evil house from the beginning.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.868
A house that was born bad.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.085
Hugh Crain's young wife died...

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.046
...seconds before she was to set eyes
on the house.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.217
She was killed when,
for no apparent reason...

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:01.972
...the horses bolted,
crashing her carriage against a big tree.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.229
Mrs. Crain was carried...

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:12.608
...uh, lifeless is the word, I think...

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.819
...into the home
her husband had built for her.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.240
Hugh Crain was left an embittered man...

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.785
...with a small daughter, Abigail, to bring up.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.806
Fortunately, for me, that is...

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.059
...Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.186
He married again.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.197
The second Mrs. Crain's death
was even more interesting...

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.532
...than her predecessor's.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:19.758
I've been unable to find out
how or why she fell...

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.135
...although I have my suspicions.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:31.853
Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse
and went to England...

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.606
...where he died in a drowning accident.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.857
Marvelous.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:40.279
I mean, the way the history of Hill House
follows a classic pattern.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.576
For some reason,
Abigail always kept that same nursery room...

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:49.246
...in Hill House where she grew up...

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.540
...and grew old.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:09.266
In later years,
she became a bedridden invalid.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:13.520
She took a girl from the village
to live with her as a paid companion.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.775
It's with this young companion...

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:22.988
...the evil reputation of Hill House
really begins.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.288
The story goes
that the old lady died calling for help...

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.582
...in the nursery upstairs...

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.794
...while the companion fooled around
with a farmhand on the veranda.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:52.768
The companion inherited Hill House
and occupied it for many years.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.687
The local people believe that,
one way or another...

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.564
...she had murdered her benefactor.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.902
She lived a life of complete solitude
in the empty house...

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.030
...though some say
that the house was not empty...

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.743
...and never has been
since the night old Miss Abby died.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:14.956
They say that whatever there was
and still is in the house...

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:18.627
...eventually drove the companion mad.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.299
We do know she hanged herself.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.592
After her death...

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.179
...the house passed legally into the hands
of a distant relative in Boston...

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:34.768
...an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson,
who I very much wanted to see.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.438
All my life I've been looking
for an honestly haunted house.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:42.651
In the interests of psychic research, you must
let me have it for a few weeks during my leave.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.864
No one who rented Hill House
ever stayed for more than a few days.

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:51.368
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:55.455
I don't believe it.
Dr. Markway is a trained anthropologist...

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:57.999
...a respected member
of a university faculty.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.585
We should welcome such a man
to investigate Hill House.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.795
Perhaps.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.881
As an old woman due shortly
to enter the next world...

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.466
...I'd like to know if there is one.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:10.846
I'm sure his report will give Hill House
a clean bill of health.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:14.683
How will you go about
conducting your investigations, Dr. Markway?

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:19.062
Well, I shall occupy the house with a group
of carefully selected assistants...

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.272
Assistants?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.149
Well, my dear Mrs. Sannerson...

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:25.360
...I am a scientist
conducting an unusual experiment.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.863
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.115
So I must have specially qualified help...

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.743
...to take notes and document any evidence
of the supernatural I may find.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.120
Who are these assistants?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.997
Well, I haven't made my final choice yet...

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.333
...but they'll come from a list of names
I've been assembling over several years.

00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:43.378
- We don't want any publicity seekers.
- No, of course not.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.506
These people have only been selected
after painstaking research.

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:50.427
They've all been involved before,
one way or another, with the abnormal.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.512
I don't like the sound of that.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.932
- Are any of the people on your list women?
- Some.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.602
- Are you a married man?
- Yes.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.687
Then your wife will be accompanying you.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.856
I'm afraid not. Heh.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.359
My wife disapproves of my experiments
with the supernatural.

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.236
She wants no part of Hill House.

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:11.364
To make sure
that everything is as it should be...

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.909
...suppose your nephew goes along
with Dr. Markway?

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:15.118
Luke?

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.748
Our young Lochinvar
from out of the Midwest. Heh.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.375
I haven't much confidence
in that branch of the family.

00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:24.252
Oh, in this case, I think you can.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.755
Luke expects to inherit Hill House...

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.466
...and he'll make sure
that his property is well taken care of.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:30.842
His property?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.931
Still, it might be rather good, at that.

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:39.100
Luke hopes one day to live off Hill House.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.770
But he never dreamed
to find himself living in it.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:46.024
Well, Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.567
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.362
A word of warning: Don't play gin with Luke.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.030
- Oh.
- He's a cardsharp.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.824
Good. That indicates a strong instinct
for self-preservation.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:59.371
Exactly what do you and your assistants
expect to find at Hill House?

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:04.584
Well, maybe only a few loose floorboards,
and maybe...

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.795
I only say maybe.

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.173
- The key to another world.

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:31.736
You've just got to let me have the car.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.322
There's no other way of getting there,
and I'm expected.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.825
- Calm down, Eleanor.
- I've even bought some new clothes.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.119
Oh, please, Bud.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:42.706
Carrie drives the car all the time,
and I never even take it out of the garage.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:46.585
- Mother...
- Mother what?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.837
Nothing.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.882
Nothing.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:58.179
Auntie Nell is blinking. Auntie Nell is blinking.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.015
Quiet, Dora.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.310
Let's talk this whole thing over
without anybody getting emotional or nervous.

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:05.562
Why shouldn't I be nervous?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.024
My first chance for a vacation in all my life,
and you won't let me take it.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:13.028
There's a very good reason Mother was afraid
for you to go anywhere, and it still applies.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:16.823
We're not gonna dig up
the family skeleton again, are we?

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.576
I think you should have a vacation, Nell.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:23.371
Nobody knows better than me what
you went through during your mother's illness.

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.541
Dirty laundry, the smell of that sickroom...

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.502
- Talk about mean old ladies.
- Bud.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.087
Let the dead rest in peace.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.797
- Oh...
- It's half my car.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.924
I helped pay for it, and I mean to take it.

00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:36.926
We don't know where you're going, do we?

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:39.638
You haven't seen fit to tell us anything,
have you?

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.514
No, you may not have the car.

00:10:41.682 --> 00:10:44.309
You know, what beats me
is why you're playing this thing so cozy...

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.144
...like this was a jailbreak or something.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.814
In any case, Eleanor, I'm sure I'm doing
what Mother would have thought best.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:53.026
Although I don't suppose
poor Mother's wishes mean very much to you.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.073
Get out. Get out, both of you.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.576
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.413
I happen to be in my bedroom,
and I pay a good part of your rent for it.

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.750
Now get out before I show you
what my nerves can really do!

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.252
Come on, Carrie. Dora.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.882
Besides, how do I know
you'll bring back my car in good condition?

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.842
Oh, come on.

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:41.032
- Yeah?
- I want my car.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.242
I mean to take it.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.994
- Which?
- The Fredericks' car.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:51.793
- You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
- It's half mine.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.962
- Who are you?
- Her sister, Miss Lance.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.508
Look, here's my driver's license...

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.969
...here's my library card...

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.556
...and here's a blood-donor card.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.309
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:12.856
- Front row, left of the far pillar.
- Thank you.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.666
"Very happy that you'll be joining us
in Hill House.

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.043
Take U.S. 50 from Boston...

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:38.214
...and watch for the turnoff onto Route 238."

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:42.802
Route 238.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.472
At last I am going someplace
where I'm expected...

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.766
...and where I'm being given shelter.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.435
And I shall never have to come back.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.979
I hope, I hope, I hope...

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:56.608
...this is what I've been waiting for all my life.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.654
I'm going. I'm really going.

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:04.449
I've finally taken a step.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.085
By now they know the car is gone...

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.630
...but they don't know where.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.800
They would never have suspected it of me.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.345
I would never have suspected it of myself.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.847
I'm a new person.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.573
Someday, someday...

00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:49.077
...someday I'll have an apartment
of my own...

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:54.707
...in a house with a pair of stone lions
guarding the gate.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:14:00.088
I might just stop anywhere
and never leave again.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.714
Or I might drive on and on...

00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:05.218
...until the wheels of the car
are worn to nothing...

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:08.137
...and I've come to the end of the world.

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:12.684
I wonder if all homeless people feel that way.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.271
I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.566
I wonder who else will be there.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.027
I wonder what Hill House is like.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.747
Well...

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.085
Well.

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:57.770
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, please.

00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:01.024
- Please unlock the gates.
- Who says?

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.776
Well, I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:07.071
- Who by?
- Dr. Markway.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.282
- You'd better come back later.
- Oh, please.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.950
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:14.037
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.914
Well, he can't rightly be expecting you...

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:19.417
...seeing as you're the only one
who's come so far.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:21.586
You mean that there's no one in the house?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.297
No one you'd want to see.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.469
- What did you say your name was?
- Eleanor Lance.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.679
And I am expected in Hill House.

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:36.351
- Unlock those gates at once.
- All right, all right.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.980
Suppose you know what you're asking for,
coming here.

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.358
Suppose they told you back in the city.

00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:04.963
You seem to be the one who's afraid.

00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:08.299
You'll be sorry I ever opened the gate.

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.219
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.055
- Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
- Yeah, I'm Dudley, the caretaker.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.932
- I shall report you.
- Huh.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.142
Think they can find anyone else
to stay around here?

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.187
Think we can't have things
just about the way we want, me and the wife...

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.481
...as long as we stay around here,
see to the house...

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:27.944
...for all you city people
think you know everything?

00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:08.860
It's staring at me.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.822
Vile. Vile.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.535
Get away from here. Get away at once.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:21.706
It's my chance. I'm being given a last chance.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.875
I could turn my car around
and go away from here...

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.293
...and no one would blame me.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.171
Anyone has a right to run away.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.674
But you are running away, Eleanor...

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.552
...and there's nowhere else to go.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.096
It's waiting for me.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.599
Evil, patient...

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.060
...waiting.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.750
Mrs. Dudley?

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:52.088
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:24.036
Um, can you take me to my room?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.678
I gather I'm the first one here, Mrs. Dudley.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.683
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
I met your hus...

00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:55.985
Talk about being scared of your own shadow.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.571
Pull yourself together.

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.909
Here.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:12.585
This is your room.

00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.129
How nice.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:17.965
I can't keep the rooms the way I'd like...

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.885
...but there's no one else they could get
that would help me.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:23.971
How very nice.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:27.058
I set dinner
on the dining room sideboard at 6.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.851
I clear up in the morning.

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.230
I have breakfast for you at 9.
I don't wait on people.

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:35.483
I don't stay after I set out the dinner.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.526
Not after it begins to get dark.

00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:40.905
I leave before the dark comes.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.114
Your husband?

00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:44.367
- We live over in town, miles away.
- Yes.

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:46.577
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:50.790
- I understand.
- We couldn't hear you in the night.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.668
- Do you have any idea when Dr. Mark...?
- No one could.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:57.213
No one lives any nearer than town.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.967
- No one will come any nearer than that.
- I know.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.427
In the night...

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.012
...in the dark.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.584
I'm like a small creature
swallowed whole by a monster...

00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:39.088
...and the monster
feels my tiny movements inside.

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:46.262
Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.259
I set dinner on the...

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.428
Thank heavens somebody's here.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.931
Oh. My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:33.309
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.144
What about this crazy house?

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:37.271
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.315
This one used to be the embalming room,
I bet.

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:40.816
It was terrible being here alone.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:43.319
- I set dinner on the sideboard at 6...
- Where's Markway?

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.154
I thought he'd be here before anyone else.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:48.449
- Serve yourselves. I clear up in the morning.
- Have you known Dr. Markway long?

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:49.742
I have breakfast ready at 9.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.745
- I've never met him.
- I don't stay after 6, after it begins to gets dark.

00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:57.416
Our only contact is our correspondence
about the, uh, quote, "experiment," unquote.

00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:58.918
I leave before the dark comes.

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:02.088
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:05.341
No one can hear you if you scream in the night.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.551
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:10.554
No one lives any nearer than town.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.057
No one will come any nearer than that...

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:15.226
...in the night...

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.644
...in the dark.

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:25.236
- You're frightened, Nell.
- Oh, no more.

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:28.197
Just when I thought I was all alone.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:30.408
But how did you know
my nickname is Nell?

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.411
Well, that is the affectionate term
for Eleanor, isn't it?

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:36.497
Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.457
What a nice way of putting it.

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:41.293
The affectionate term for Theodora is Theo.

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:43.087
Theo.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.089
We're going to be great friends, Theo.

00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:47.758
Like sisters?

00:23:48.718 --> 00:23:50.636
Listen, there's no need
to hang around our rooms.

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:52.430
- Let's go exploring.
- Oh, I'd like to.

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:56.434
Why don't you put on one of your new things?
Something that'll stand out.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.687
I think it's a good idea around here
to always remain strictly visible.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.857
Ha, ha. Be ready in a jiffy.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.276
How did you know I brought new clothes?

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.987
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.281
Anyway, that's better than my heart.

00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:27.631
How did I get into this? Why am I here?

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.633
What nightmares are waiting?

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:30.843
Damn it.

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:33.679
I still say one of these doors
should lead to the main hall.

00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:35.306
Any lights near you, Nell?

00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.309
Nell.

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:41.645
It helps if you make a game of it.

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:45.399
- Pretend this is hide-and-seek.
- But we're still lost.

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:47.443
Yes.

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:51.822
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.658
What's the matter?

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.828
There's something with us.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:01.165
I don't see anything.

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.876
- Can't you feel it?
- No.

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.545
I feel a chill.

00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:10.007
- It's moving.
- It's just the air rushing past our ears.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.051
No.

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:14.011
Then who?

00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:17.014
What?

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.099
The house.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.352
It's alive.

00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:31.612
She didn't hear that.

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.740
Nobody heard it but me.

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.246
It wants you, Nell.

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:43.541
The house is calling you.

00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:55.844
I've waited such a long time.
Is this what I came so far to find?

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.601
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.648
You wouldn't believe this,
but five minutes ago I left this door open...

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:09.191
...so you could find your way.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:11.193
It closed by itself.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.113
Welcome to Hill House. I'm Dr. Markway.

00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:18.450
Oh, thank goodness. Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:20.869
- How do you know I'm not?
- Don't be ghoulish.

00:26:21.037 --> 00:26:24.707
Now, now, you mustn't confuse
ghoulish and ghostly.

00:26:24.874 --> 00:26:27.501
The word "ghoulish"
is used to describe a feeling of horror...

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.545
...often accompanied by intense cold.

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:32.089
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are a visible thing.

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:35.968
- Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
- What's the matter?

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.971
Well, let's just say we're scared of the dark.

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:42.516
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:46.020
- I'm Theodora.
- Well, then you must be Eleanor.

00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:47.813
I'm unsure at the moment.

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:51.191
- If it turns out you're not, I'll be disappointed.
- Oh. All right.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:55.446
It's Theo who's wearing velvet,
so I must be Eleanor in tweed.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:56.655
Good.

00:26:56.823 --> 00:26:59.575
Follow me and I'll lead you
through the uncharted waste of Hill House.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:01.785
Dinner's waiting.

00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:08.792
- Do you like it?
- Oh, lovely. What do you call this?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.628
The Purple Parlor.

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.714
We're gonna use this as the operating room.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.884
I mean the center of operations.

00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:19.553
- It's not very cheerful.
- Oh, I don't know.

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.972
There's nothing more cozy
than an old gargoyle...

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.891
...except maybe a whipping post or two.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:27.144
This house does have its little oddities.

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.605
The man who built it was a misfit...

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:31.774
...who hated people
and their conventional ideas.

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:35.402
He built his house to suit his mind.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.782
For instance,
all the doors are hung slightly off-center.

00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:42.743
Probably explains why
they keep swinging shut by themselves.

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:44.203
Watch.

00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:47.164
Now watch this.

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.088
Yeah, well, what did I tell you?

00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:59.760
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.

00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:02.763
No wonder it's impossible
to find your way around.

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.641
Add up all these wrong angles...

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:08.602
...and you get one big distortion
in the house as a whole.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.854
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.

00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:13.857
I'm hungry.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:15.901
- Let's go.
- Mm, sorry.

00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.820
In the psychic world, we're apt to forget...

00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:20.864
...that food is still the main concern
of poor old Homo sapiens.

00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:25.703
Ah. You see? Closed by itself.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.040
To the right, ladies.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:39.466
Now, which door?

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.010
- That one.
- Wrong.

00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:44.096
I've studied a map, it's this one.

00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:50.269
- This proves it. One of you is a witch.
- A broom closet.

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:53.188
If you can't find your way around,
how will we ever?

00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:56.942
All these doors.
It makes me think of the lady and the tiger.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.987
Well, let's see if there's a tiger
behind this one.

00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.197
- Ah.
- Oh.

00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:09.580
Well, that's funny.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.206
- No tiger?
- Listen.

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.385
What's wrong? Too much vermouth?

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.179
Nothing that serious.

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:30.642
And please, please,
no cracks about my passion for spirits.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.395
If you two are the ghostly inhabitants
of Hill House...

00:29:33.563 --> 00:29:35.439
...I must confess I'm glad I came.

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:38.734
Eleanor, Theo, it has taken 60 million years...

00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:41.987
...to develop the carnivorous biped
you see before you.

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:45.282
- Luke Sannerson.
- Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.577
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them in college.

00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:52.456
Are we to expect any more
carnivorous bipeds, Dr. Markway?

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.125
Originally, there were six committed
to the experiment...

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.628
...but one by one the others dropped out.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:01.006
I suppose they were frightened
by the various unsavory stories...

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.050
...about the house.

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:04.885
You're the only ones left.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:09.264
- What stories?
- You didn't investigate before you came here?

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.891
No.

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.185
So much the better.

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.896
You should be innocent and receptive.

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:21.151
- So let's drink to our success, huh?
- Success?

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.696
And just how do you reckon success
in a junket like this, doc?

00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:27.324
I'd like to drink to, uh...

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.035
To just us, good companions.

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:31.620
Excellent.

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:34.832
To my new companion.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:38.961
Except... Except I don't drink.

00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:41.922
Well...

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.512
- Well, I think I'll have some more salmon.
- Palissy.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.389
- Yeah? How much is it worth?
- Plenty.

00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.475
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:56.812
I'll take a pair of Kästle skis for them
any day of the week.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.565
I wonder how much I'll be able to get
for this New England fossil.

00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:03.569
Don't ever let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment, she's giving us the best.

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:08.240
Mm. I'm a simple fellow myself,
easily satisfied by the best of everything.

00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:10.534
Including, I hope,
some startling events to come.

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:13.370
Exactly what do you expect to happen,
Dr. Markway?

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:16.498
- John.
- Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:19.251
What's going to happen? Why are we here?

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:23.380
Well, like so many other people
through the ages...

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.340
...I've been intrigued by the supernatural...

00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:28.677
...or rather,
the possibility of the supernatural.

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:31.179
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.

00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:34.683
You're here to keep track of what happens
and take notes for an authenticated record.

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.644
- Okay. But why us?
- Well, it's no accident.

00:31:37.812 --> 00:31:41.356
You're what's left of a select company
chosen with great care.

00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:43.567
I combed the records of psychic societies...

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:47.070
...the back numbers of newspapers,
reports of parapsychologists...

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:51.700
...in the hope of finding people who've been
touched in some way by the supernatural.

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:55.412
It's my belief that the very presence
of people like yourselves in this house...

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.707
...will help to stimulate the strange forces
at work here.

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:01.126
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.

00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:04.087
I'm here because I'm a wolf
in ghost's clothing.

00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:08.342
Well, I'm not really running
a psychic beauty contest.

00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:09.760
You're here, Theo...

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:12.679
...because of your remarkable powers
of extrasensory perception.

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:15.766
Oh, ESP, huh? Don't believe in it.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.643
Oh, Theo's a champ.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:21.355
Her name shines in the annals
of Duke University's Psychic Lab...

00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:26.818
...where she identified 19 out of 20 cards
held up out of sight and hearing.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:30.864
But I've never had anything to do
with the supernatural.

00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:34.493
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.

00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.328
What's a poltergeist?

00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:40.332
- A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
- I wouldn't know.

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:43.669
According to the records
of the International Psychic Society...

00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:47.714
...showers of stones fell on your house
for three days when you were 10 years old.

00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:48.924
That's ridiculous.

00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:53.762
It was witnessed by your family,
the neighbors, sightseers and the police.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.224
In fact, it's the only case
ever officially recorded by the police.

00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:59.518
It never happened.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.478
Perhaps not, if you say so.

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:05.315
I only mention it because that's the reason
why I wanted you in Hill House.

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.900
Hey, look, doc, level with us, huh?

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.736
I mean, you're a college prof,
a man with a PhD.

00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:13.156
You can't really believe there's such a thing
as a haunted house.

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:16.785
Anyway, I wish you'd stop referring
to this desirable property as haunted.

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.578
There's that word "haunted" again.

00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:22.290
Makes me expect
to find a disembodied hand in the sauce.

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:25.460
Nobody knows even
why some houses are called haunted.

00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:28.213
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?

00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:33.468
No. Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:37.097
"A deranged house"
isn't a bad way of putting it.

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:40.851
Your aunt thinks
that maybe Hill House was born bad.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.104
Such houses are described
in the Bible as leprous...

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.732
...or before that,
in Homer's phrase for the underworld:

00:33:46.899 --> 00:33:48.358
A house of Hades.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.318
Aw, come off it, doc.

00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:53.488
Really, the local mayor
makes more sense to me.

00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:56.283
He claims the disturbances are caused
by subterranean waters...

00:33:56.451 --> 00:34:00.829
...or electric currents, atmospheric pressure,
sunspots, earth tremors, et cetera.

00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:04.916
Sure, people always wanna put an easy label
on things even if it's meaningless.

00:34:05.084 --> 00:34:07.544
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:10.255
Well, there's an explanation
you don't have to think twice about.

00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:12.966
And it has a scientific ring.

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.302
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.764
Mother says they were always against us
because she wouldn't mix with them.

00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:20.057
Mother says...

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.062
Oh, dear.

00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:28.940
That's all right, Eleanor.

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:32.694
- Go on. What does your mother say?
- Nothing.

00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:36.156
I must be more tired than I thought.

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:38.533
My mother died two months ago.

00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.410
You weren't sorry when it happened...

00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:44.081
...were you?

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:46.666
No. She wasn't very happy.

00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:49.669
Then I won't say I'm sorry now.

00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.881
Eleanor, if I'd known,
I'd never have asked you to come here.

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:55.300
But I'm grateful you did. I had to get away.

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:59.054
- Well, perhaps you should...
- Oh, please, let's talk about something else.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.431
Oh, dear.

00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:07.771
Hey, doc, see that? Now, what about that?
Does salt work against the supernatural?

00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:12.984
The Montusi bushmen thought so,
but they're extinct.

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:17.197
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.375
I have a place in this room.

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.961
These people are my friends.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:35.632
I'm one of them. I belong.

00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:38.885
Gin.

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:40.387
Aah, it's the fifth time!

00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:42.722
- Five times in a row.
- Twelve dollars, please.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.142
- You're lucky it isn't stained.
- Oh, no, that's all right.

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:48.478
But the upholstery on the couch.
I have some cleaning fluid upstairs.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:49.855
Pay up, Luke. Cash on the line.

00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:52.190
Over my dead body.
You knew every card I had in my hand.

00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:54.109
- Come on.
- There's a name for that, you know.

00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:56.111
If you mean cheating, I don't have to.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:58.196
Okay, Miss ESP,
so go dream yourself up 12 bucks.

00:35:58.364 --> 00:36:00.699
Oh, pay up, you welsher.
I won fair and I want my money.

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:09.082
- What was it?
- Oh. I had a feeling.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.460
- I'm sure it was just my imagination.
- A feeling you were being watched?

00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:14.421
Yes. Yes, I did.

00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:17.424
The house. It watches.
It watches every move we make.

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:18.842
That's your imagination.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.428
Don't be so cocksure of everything, Luke.

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:25.473
A closed mind is the worst defense
against the supernatural.

00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:29.561
You seem to think you're too civilized to need
to protect yourself against evil spirits.

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:33.857
But even prehistoric man had a dozen
practical methods of warding them off.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.067
Some of your theories strike me
as prehistoric.

00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.278
Besides, they downgrade property values.

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:41.448
Look, I know the supernatural is something
that isn't supposed to happen.

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.158
But it does happen.

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:47.537
Ghosts make the papers
along with celebrities every day of the week.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.748
If it happens to you...

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:52.542
...you're liable
to have that shut door in your mind...

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.419
...ripped right off its hinges.

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:57.547
Now, look, doc, we're buddies, okay?
But don't try to convert me.

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.716
I'm trying to prepare you.

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:04.471
I think there's something going on
in this house, or I wouldn't be here.

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.223
What?

00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:12.145
Don't ask me to give a name
to something which hasn't got a name.

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.065
I don't know.

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:21.279
Well, tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.

00:37:21.447 --> 00:37:23.031
Unless anyone wants to clear out now...

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:25.283
...and not have anything more to do
with Hill House.

00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:28.203
Not me. I hope to have plenty
to do with it someday, money-wise.

00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:30.372
We couldn't leave now
even if we wanted to.

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:32.207
You mean I'm holding you prisoner?

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:36.836
- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.
- We could always break out.

00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:39.923
I have a key to the gate any time you want it.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:43.176
- I wouldn't dream of leaving.
- Thank you.

00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.011
Adventurers all.

00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:48.223
But you mustn't expect every night
to be Halloween.

00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:50.850
Psychic phenomena
are subject to certain laws.

00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:52.811
And just what are these laws?

00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:55.605
You won't know until you break them.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.232
By the way, at the end of each day...

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.859
...I'm gonna ask you to fill out
these forms I've mimeographed.

00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:01.403
Very scientific, aren't we?

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.281
Well, the really scientific phase
won't start for a while yet.

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:06.574
First of all, we have to get orientated.

00:38:06.742 --> 00:38:09.077
Hey, what's this?
Looks like "psy-kookiness."

00:38:09.245 --> 00:38:10.578
Nothing like that wrong with me.

00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:13.290
Psychokinesis is just the technical form...

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.667
...for what you'd call objects moving
by themselves.

00:38:15.835 --> 00:38:17.085
Actually, they don't...

00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:22.424
...but are moved by a force from somewhere,
which we call psychokinesis.

00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.635
Oh. I see.

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.013
Oh, about this ghost
I can expect in my room tonight...

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.224
...tell me, is it male or female?

00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.020
Well, good night, ladies, doc.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.983
Oh, I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.360
Won't make any difference.

00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.779
Oh, I see.

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:49.534
- Well, good night, Dr. Markway.
- John.

00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:53.663
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:57.834
I'll turn the lights off below,
in case you wonder who did it.

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:01.838
If you feel in the least bit nervous,
just run right into my room, then.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.840
Thanks. Good night.

00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:06.217
I'll come in for a second.

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:09.804
You've been thinking of changing your hair,
and I know just the style for you.

00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:13.767
Why, yes, I was. But I'm awfully tired.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:17.937
- Thanks anyhow.
- Okay. We have a date for breakfast.

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:20.190
Good night, Theo.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:48.343
Funny, everything's so ugly
and yet so comfortable.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.388
Like drowning, I guess.

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:59.312
Now I can think about them. I'm all alone.

00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:03.733
Alone.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:17.038
He won't know I locked it.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:23.378
Against what, Eleanor? Against what?

00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:53.158
All right, Mother, all right.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:00.248
Just a minute. I'm coming.

00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:09.883
- Nell!
- What? What, Theo?

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.552
- Nell, in here!
- Oh.

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.682
I'm here. What is it?

00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:22.854
- What is it?
- I thought it was you pounding.

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:26.399
It was. I mean, I did.

00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.277
But now it's down
near the other end of the hall.

00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:35.742
It's not at all like Mother knocking on the wall.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:40.830
It's only a noise,
and the room is terribly cold.

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.416
Terribly, terribly cold.

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:47.295
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.380
Why should they be knocking on the walls?

00:41:49.548 --> 00:41:52.550
Well, something is.
Anyway, it's only a noise.

00:41:52.718 --> 00:41:54.969
Earth tremors?

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:17.367
Maybe it'll go down
on the other side of the hall.

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:52.443
- No!
- Go away!

00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:57.574
Go away! Go away! Go away!

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:03.371
Now I've done it.

00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:06.874
It was looking for the room
with someone inside.

00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:16.342
Oh. You big baby.

00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:19.345
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.

00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:21.889
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:25.727
- Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
- I don't know.

00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:28.021
- Warmer now?
- No.

00:43:28.188 --> 00:43:31.774
In a minute, I'll go out in the hall and call them.
Are you all right?

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.278
Oh, God, Nell!

00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:40.366
It's against the top of the door!

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:56.215
It's found us.

00:43:56.383 --> 00:44:01.012
Now I know why people scream,
because I think I'm going to.

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:04.766
- Is the door locked?
- Huh?

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.645
No.

00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:48.267
You can't get in!

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.968
It's over.

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:25.346
- How do you know?
- Can't you feel it?

00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:28.975
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.

00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:30.977
Why, yes.

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.856
Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock.
My mother...

00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:38.776
Intense shock
is one of the symptoms I've got.

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:47.493
Where have you two been?

00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:49.954
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:51.497
Did anything happen?

00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:08.055
No. Nothing in particular.

00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:12.894
Just something knocked on the door
with a cannonball...

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.271
...then tried to get in and eat us.

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.815
I'm with Nell.

00:46:17.983 --> 00:46:20.985
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy,
some combination.

00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:23.613
- There isn't a scratch on the wood.
- Or anywhere else.

00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.115
How nice it didn't mar the woodwork.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.412
Where were you, Dr. Markway?

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.831
Chasing a dog.

00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:36.459
At least, we assumed it was a dog.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.919
We followed it outside.

00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:42.507
You mean? You mean it was inside?

00:46:42.674 --> 00:46:45.092
I thought I heard something
run past my room.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.720
I woke Luke, and we went looking for it
all over the house...

00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:49.388
...and finally out in the garden.

00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:52.767
But let's face it, girls,
we didn't get very far from the house.

00:46:52.935 --> 00:46:56.354
Then you must have heard
that ungodly noise.

00:46:56.522 --> 00:47:00.066
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.

00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:03.402
At least, nothing audible to us.

00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:10.117
- We'd better take precautions.
- Against what?

00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:13.830
Well, when Luke and I are decoyed outside...

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:16.207
...and you two are bottled up inside...

00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:20.211
...wouldn't you say that something,
somehow, is trying to separate us?

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.739
Good morning, Dr. Markway.

00:47:48.907 --> 00:47:52.493
- Morning, and please call me John.
- John.

00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:57.331
- This curious life seems to agree with you.
- Oh. Thank you.

00:47:57.499 --> 00:47:59.709
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:01.919
How do you manage to look so pretty
after last night?

00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:03.838
Well, that was last night.

00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.464
There may have been a little noise.

00:48:07.342 --> 00:48:09.093
One has to expect that in these old houses.

00:48:10.512 --> 00:48:13.139
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed
and on your way this morning.

00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:14.348
Not likely.

00:48:14.516 --> 00:48:17.310
This is my first vacation in years,
and I'm going to enjoy it.

00:48:17.477 --> 00:48:19.562
Hmm, that's the point.
You need a real vacation.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.316
- This isn't the place for one.
- I mean to stay, period.

00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:25.526
Unless, of course, you want to get rid of me.

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.987
No, no, you mustn't think that.

00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.489
Till last night,
you were just a name on my list.

00:48:30.657 --> 00:48:32.533
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.

00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.995
- Oh. She's horrible.
- No, no, you mustn't make fun of me.

00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:38.789
You're sweet and pleasant,
and everyone likes you very much.

00:48:38.957 --> 00:48:41.792
- I wanna know more about you.
- Oh.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.797
I dislike lobster,
crack my knuckles when I'm nervous...

00:48:46.965 --> 00:48:50.259
...save buttons, and sleep on my left side.

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.261
Hmm? Why on the left side?

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:55.848
I read someplace
it wears the heart out quicker.

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:58.142
Well, that's a depressing thought.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.147
For the past 11 years,
I've been walled up alive on a desert island.

00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:06.859
Oh, I thought you might be hiding
some dark romantic secret in your past.

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:09.153
Romantic?

00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:13.199
I've spent all my adult life
taking care of my invalid mother...

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:14.867
...until she died.

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:17.411
No, it wasn't romantic.

00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:21.374
Well, now that you're free at last, you shouldn't
be wasting your time in Hill House.

00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.918
- It's a mistake.
- But it isn't, don't you see?

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.503
The only thing that kept me going...

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:28.756
...was that someday
I knew something would happen.

00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:33.010
Something truly extraordinary,
like Hill House.

00:49:33.178 --> 00:49:35.930
Hmm. It's extraordinary.

00:49:36.556 --> 00:49:38.683
What will you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.228
No, no job, nothing.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:45.231
You wouldn't send me back, would you?

00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:48.484
Well, that depends on what happens.

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:52.488
We may all have to go back.
But I won't give up easily.

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:56.325
How did you get so interested
in the supernatural?

00:49:56.493 --> 00:50:00.913
I didn't want to become
what my father called a practical man.

00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:03.791
I come from one of those
respectable English families...

00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:07.211
...that dragged all the Victorian virtues
into the 20th century.

00:50:07.379 --> 00:50:09.296
In a Gladstone bag, of course.

00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:11.966
Everything had to be practical
and conventional.

00:50:12.134 --> 00:50:13.467
So naturally, my first reaction...

00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:16.429
...was to choose something useless
and unconventional, like ghosts.

00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:18.514
But you're an anthropologist now.

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:22.184
Mm. When I refused to read law at Oxford
as my father had...

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.228
...there was a terrific row.

00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:27.023
I took off for America,
without my Gladstone bag...

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.191
...and worked my way through college.

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.360
I decided on anthropology
because it seemed to me...

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.571
...to be a short step
from the study of dead souls...

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:36.907
...to the study of dead men
and dead civilizations.

00:50:37.075 --> 00:50:38.909
I'm not very practical, either.

00:50:39.077 --> 00:50:41.787
Hmm. But it didn't occur to me
till I was hooked...

00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:45.124
...that my combined knowledge
of anthropology and psychic phenomena...

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:47.793
...had led me on to something very practical.

00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:51.505
You see, if ghosts,
which are pure spirit, come from man...

00:50:51.673 --> 00:50:54.175
...then perhaps it's possible someday
to have individuals...

00:50:54.342 --> 00:50:58.763
...whose spiritual caliber far surpasses
anything humanity has yet known.

00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:02.141
Human nature could certainly stand
some improvements.

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:04.727
However, my idea remains pure theory...

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:08.439
...until somebody proves definitely
the supernatural exists.

00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:12.651
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.

00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:16.447
Thank you.
Well, I've been trying to remember.

00:51:16.615 --> 00:51:19.450
I can remember knowing I was frightened...

00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:23.579
...but I can't remember
actually being frightened or how I felt.

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.372
I think it's because it was so unreal.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.917
Still could be subterranean waters,
you know.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.796
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.

00:51:32.297 --> 00:51:35.299
Not good, this feeling of excitement.

00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:38.094
It's the first sign
you've fallen under the spell of the house.

00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:41.722
Maybe it isn't just the house.

00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:44.391
Then what else?

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:49.396
Let's blame it on sunspots.

00:51:50.148 --> 00:51:52.399
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.

00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:56.112
If anyone gets hurt,
it's going to be your fault, Markway.

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.321
Mm-hm.

00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:01.242
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts
ever hurt anyone physically.

00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:03.619
You see?
We weren't in any actual danger at all.

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.913
- Isn't that right, John?
- No, not entirely.

00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:08.332
Fear alone can do the damage to the victim.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.460
Prehistoric man, for instance,
could die of fright during an eclipse.

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:14.463
- Poor sap.
- You mean poor Homo sapiens.

00:52:16.007 --> 00:52:19.009
Modern man can react
with the same unreasoning terror...

00:52:19.177 --> 00:52:20.511
...to a supernatural event...

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:23.305
...especially if he doesn't believe
that the supernatural exists.

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:26.725
I've always been more afraid
of being left alone or left out...

00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:29.770
...than of things that go bump in the night.

00:52:30.355 --> 00:52:31.647
What are you afraid of, Theo?

00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:35.359
Of knowing what I really want.

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:40.156
- Good morning, fellow Earthlings.
- Luke, what are you afraid of?

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.658
What I just saw in the hall.

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:46.453
- Is there something?
- You mean you haven't seen it?

00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:49.790
Well, the show's just getting good. Come on.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.881
Right here.

00:52:58.925 --> 00:53:02.219
- It's writing?
- Writing.

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:07.016
Chalk.

00:53:09.102 --> 00:53:11.312
Or something like chalk.

00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.449
- Can you read it?
- No.

00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.159
"Help.

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.621
Eleanor...

00:53:28.788 --> 00:53:30.998
...come home."

00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:32.541
What?

00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:37.087
"Eleanor."
Oh, no.

00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:40.132
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.

00:53:40.675 --> 00:53:42.551
"Crazy" is the word for it, all right.

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:45.763
- Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
- But it's crazy. Why?

00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:48.182
Why all the fuss?
It spelled her name right, didn't it?

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.935
- It spelled out my name.
- Take it easy.

00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:54.021
It's my name.
It belongs to me, and something is using it.

00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:56.232
- Listen to me...
- Writing it, calling me with my name!

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.983
- Just because your name...
- That's it!

00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:01.070
It knows my name, doesn't it?

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:03.489
- It knows my name!
- Simmer down, Nell.

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:06.158
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:09.495
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:11.872
I just want to know so that...

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.166
Maybe it was only for a joke
to frighten me.

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.710
You know none of us wrote it, baby.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.713
- She's lying. I could swear she did it.
- Easy, Eleanor, easy.

00:54:19.881 --> 00:54:21.006
I clear breakfast at 10:00.

00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:23.342
- Why should I wanna write your name?
- I set lunch at 1.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.469
I didn't wait to have breakfast with you.

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.680
- That's the way I agreed to.
- You're way out, baby.

00:54:27.847 --> 00:54:29.431
You don't know Theo as I'm beginning to.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.642
- I clear up at 10.
- Mrs. Dudley, please!

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.020
- Nobody blames you for being upset.
- It's 10:00.

00:54:35.188 --> 00:54:36.897
Why me? Why should I be the one chosen?

00:54:37.065 --> 00:54:39.525
Maybe something in the house
finds you a kindred spirit.

00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:43.195
Maybe it thinks you have more understanding
and sympathy than the rest of us.

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:44.947
Hmm. Maybe you wrote it yourself.

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.908
Oh, sure, I'm just the kind
to want to see my name...

00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.618
...scribbled all over this foul house.

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.121
Well, it's one way to attract attention, isn't it?

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.748
You think I like the idea
I'm the center of attention?

00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:58.127
Why are you all done up
in that new hairstyle?

00:54:59.879 --> 00:55:01.213
You...

00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:03.966
- You suggested I change my hair.
- That's enough, Eleanor.

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.301
How dare you? How dare you?

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:06.510
Can't you see, Eleanor...

00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:09.596
...Theo's just trying to get a rise out of you
so you won't be frightened?

00:55:09.764 --> 00:55:10.889
Mm-hm.

00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:12.266
Oh.

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:15.144
I'm sorry.

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:17.271
Take Eleanor to her room, Theo.

00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:19.648
We'll postpone the tour of the house
till this afternoon.

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.442
Okay, but don't forget.

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:23.110
I don't want to spend another night...

00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:25.946
...wondering what's over my head
or underneath me.

00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:30.784
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?

00:55:30.952 --> 00:55:33.245
No one will leave you behind.

00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:46.675
Holy cow. Mount Rushmore.

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:50.596
- It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
- How?

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.306
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:55.642
It's supposed to be St. Francis
curing the lepers.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:57.978
- My.
- I'd say it's a family portrait.

00:55:58.146 --> 00:55:59.521
A composite.

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:04.401
The tall, draped, masculine type,
that's old Hugh Crain...

00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:08.364
...pointing out all of the great treasures
in this creepy house he built.

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:11.658
Now, the dame on the end down there
and this one must be his two wives.

00:56:11.826 --> 00:56:13.744
His daughter, Abigail.

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:17.122
- Now, the dog...
- The dog you were chasing last night.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.042
Yeah, very good.

00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:23.128
Now, that one,
she's got to be the companion, huh?

00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:25.672
The one who's supposed
to have murdered Abigail or something.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.843
No, no, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.

00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:33.514
You know, I wonder how this statue got here.
It wasn't on the original inventory.

00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.641
Maybe I'll break it up
and sell it for tombstones.

00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:37.476
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:39.436
- Oh, no.
Mm-hm.

00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:40.896
Yeah, she does, at that.

00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:44.358
A natural beauty, I'd call her.

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:48.195
What does he think of me, really?

00:56:48.363 --> 00:56:50.906
Am I being a fool?

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:54.243
Don't let me know too surely
what he thinks of me.

00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:56.620
You know,
this could be a family portrait of us.

00:56:56.788 --> 00:56:59.957
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You're the companion.

00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:02.876
I'm Abigail, grown up.

00:57:03.044 --> 00:57:05.212
And Markway could be old Hugh.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.090
- Where do I fit in?
- The dog.

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.218
Tell me, uh,
when are you gonna show me your ESP?

00:57:11.386 --> 00:57:14.138
- Keep your hands to yourself.
- What's going on?

00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:18.058
Oh. More than meets the eye.

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:23.105
You know, this wouldn't be such a bad room
without the statue.

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:26.900
Oh, ideal for the zombies' annual ball.

00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:30.988
Why don't you dance with Hugh, Eleanor?
I believe he has his eye on you.

00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:32.906
- That's not funny.
- Don't be so chicken.

00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:35.492
- Leave Eleanor alone.
- I'll bet she doesn't know how to dance.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.536
I do too.

00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:44.626
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:47.087
I believe he's going to accept.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.603
- He moved.
- Of course.

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.772
Haven't you noticed how nothing
in this house moves until you look away...

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.776
...and then you just catch something
out of the corner of your eye?

00:58:09.944 --> 00:58:11.820
- Ouch!
- Oh!

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:14.406
She stepped on my toe.

00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:18.577
Well, let's go out this way
before somebody gets hurt.

00:58:21.372 --> 00:58:22.414
Come over here.

00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:25.083
I want to show you something
really unique.

00:58:34.093 --> 00:58:37.471
A library complete with ivory tower.

00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:40.390
Oh. I can't go in there.

00:58:40.558 --> 00:58:43.101
- Eleanor?
- My mother...

00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:44.436
Yes?

00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:46.647
That smell...

00:58:47.815 --> 00:58:52.027
- It's just stale air, Eleanor.
- No, no, that other smell. Awful.

00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:54.696
Smells sweet to me, honey.

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:57.908
At 25 cents a book,
I should do all right with this room, huh?

00:58:58.535 --> 00:59:01.870
I don't think I'll do much reading
while I'm here.

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:05.040
- Not if the books smell like the library.
- I didn't notice it.

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.000
- Oh.
- No, that's good, Eleanor.

00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:08.710
It's just what we're after.

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:11.588
Try and remember your reaction
and describe it exactly...

00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:13.215
...when you write your notes tonight.

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:14.633
That's what I'm here for.

00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:17.803
Only, do you mind
if I skip the library for now?

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:21.598
No, no. Do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.

00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:26.436
- You're sure you're all right, huh?
- Yes.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.486
Now, I want to show you something
really interesting.

00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:37.406
You remember that companion,
the one Abigail had...

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:38.699
...when she was an old lady?

00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:41.368
Well, you see that little balcony...

00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:45.289
...clear up at the top there,
right up there in the shadows?

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.749
That's where the companion hanged herself.

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:50.586
- Would've been easier to jump.
- Without a parachute?

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:53.130
They say she tied the rope
to the railing and then...

00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:56.633
- Thanks, we get it.
- Hey, I've just had a great idea.

00:59:56.801 --> 01:00:00.429
You know what I think I'll do with this room?
After I inherit the house, of course.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.222
I'll turn it into a nightclub.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.392
Tear out these bookshelves
and put a band in there.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.603
And, oh, now comes the best part.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.355
A whole line of beautiful chorus girls
dancing down these stairs.

01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:11.607
Can't you see it?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.989
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.657
- Quick thinking.
- Instinct.

01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:23.243
My strong instinct for self-preservation.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:26.747
And, you know, it's telling me right now
loud and clear to get the hell out of here.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:40.302
Vile. Hideous.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.316
I wonder what it would be like
looking down from there.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.985
That's where she did it.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.237
From that window.

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:02.282
Climbing out through the bars...

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.118
...hanging on for an instant...

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:07.704
...hanging on...

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.835
Eleanor, you'll fall!

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.338
Didn't you hear me calling?

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:21.051
This house,
you have to watch it every minute.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:24.346
Eleanor. Eleanor.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.725
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I really think I ought to send you home.

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:32.104
- Oh, no, please, I can't go home.
- It's no reflection on you.

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.106
An atmosphere like this
might break anyone down.

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:36.608
But I'm not breaking down.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.945
I did hear noises last night.
Something was trying to get into the room.

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:49.413
You realize, don't you, that if even one,
one, event is proved to be a hallucination...

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.124
...then this whole experiment
will be questioned?

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:55.669
Oh. I'm not crazy, you know.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:59.506
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.639
Well, we'll let it go for now.

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:11.393
- Maybe I'm just being selfish.
- Selfish?

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.812
Keeping you here
for the sake of the experiment.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.858
Oh. Of course.
For the sake of the experiment.

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:20.777
You do seem to be the main attraction...

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.280
...for whatever's in the house.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:27.784
- But I'll send you back the minute...
- Oh, no, please. I'm all right. Really, I am.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.495
Eleanor.

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:33.498
Well, don't you two look cozy?

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:38.086
Oh. Uh, she was halfway off the veranda
when I caught her.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:41.757
I was leaning back
to see the top of the tower.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:45.093
- I got dizzy.
- Dizzy like a fox, huh?

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:52.058
Poor Nell. You look like death.
Let's go inside.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.813
- Theo.
- Hmm?

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.982
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:02.778
- You're the doctor.
- Oh, but that's my room, my very own room.

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:07.157
Well, I wouldn't want to run the risk
of either of you spending another night alone.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:10.076
- Oh...
- Don't get all hung up, Nell.

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:14.372
We'll have fun. Like sisters.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.799
- It tickles.
- Of course.

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.426
Your toes are tickled pink.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:28.386
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.557
Have another drink. It will keep the chill out.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:36.394
Just a teensy one.
To keep the chill out. Ha-ha-ha.

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:38.772
- I don't really like whiskey.
- This is brandy.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.607
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:44.319
By the time I'm through with you, Nell,
you'll be a different person.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.824
- Ooh. It's wicked.
- Ha, ha.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.575
I mean, on my foot.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:54.079
You've got foolishness
and wickedness mixed up.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.081
Maybe.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:59.543
Haven't had much chance
to learn the difference.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:00.877
Know something?

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:02.754
Even when I'd play solitaire in my room...

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.923
...she'd bang on the wall
and make me feel guilty...

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.843
...for leaving her alone just that little bit.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.136
- She'd always...
- Your mother?

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:16.309
My mother, mother, mother. Ha, ha.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.938
Story of my dull life.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.732
What's your apartment like?

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.734
Oh, it's an old place
we furnished ourselves...

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.112
...from a lot of stuff we picked up
in the junk shops.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.447
We both love fixing over old things.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:30.907
Like me.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.871
You married?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.039
No.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.418
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.213
I'm stupid and wicked and untrustworthy...

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.840
...and not good for anything at all.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:51.261
Oh, I don't think so.
Maybe just a little bit tight at the moment.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:53.221
Tell me something about where you live.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.058
Hmm.

01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:01.313
I haven't had it long enough
to believe it's my own.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.609
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, I'm sure.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:09.279
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:13.825
Buying one thing at a time
to make sure I get everything absolutely right.

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:20.707
Took me two weeks to find
the little stone lions I keep on the mantel.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.585
Brush their teeth every night.

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:27.589
I've got a hunch I better get you back
to your apartment as fast as I can.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.174
- Oh, don't say that.
- I only mean...

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.842
Why do you all pick on me?

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:35.138
Am I the public dump or something
for everybody's fear?

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:42.854
I don't want to leave Hill House
ever, ever, ever.

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:48.109
I've been waiting all my life
for something like this to happen.

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.696
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:00.121
What's wrong with you, doc?

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:04.292
Stand there. Go on, stand there.
You too, girls. Stand there.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.423
A cold spot. A genuine cold spot.

01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:13.093
I guarantee it won't register
on any thermometer.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.429
Oh, bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.

01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:19.182
- Coming from somewhere.
- A draft? In Hill House?

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.726
Not unless you can make
one of the doors stay open.

01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:26.106
No, I found it. The heart of Hill House.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:28.733
You mean where we're standing?

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.944
Behind these doors.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.279
- What's in there?
- The nursery.

01:06:33.447 --> 01:06:36.199
Abigail Crain grew up and died there.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:41.121
- Just the place to chill our beer, huh?
- No, no, don't go in there.

01:06:41.288 --> 01:06:45.375
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker
a while longer, then.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:46.710
Now, don't give me that, doc.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:49.212
Whew. It's like the doorway to a tomb.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:52.382
Bless you.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.801
Now, that's enough, girls.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.470
You'd better run along to bed
before you catch cold.

01:06:57.638 --> 01:07:02.100
- Yes, teacher. Bless you.
- Come on.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.907
No, no, no. There's got to be a draft.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.244
The floor's solid.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:24.164
Look, doc, don't give me
any of that supernatural jazz.

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:27.208
This is something I can feel.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.127
And see.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:32.088
Maybe there's a pipeline
to the North Pole, huh?

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:36.176
Why won't you accept it for what it is,
a supernatural phenomenon?

01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:38.803
You knock on wood, don't you?

01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.431
Yeah. What's that got to do with it?

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.184
It shows that even you, despite yourself...

01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:49.314
...feel that there are forces beyond nature
able to help or hurt us.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.565
Now, wait a minute.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.776
Are you trying to tell me
belief in a superstition...

01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:55.653
...is the same thing
as believing in the supernatural?

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.906
It's food for thought.

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:04.120
Frozen food for thought.

01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:11.377
You know what I think?

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:14.255
Markway had us all so edgy,
we're getting the cold sweats.

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.925
The temperature doesn't have to drop
to make you feel like that.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.468
That's right.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.179
Music gives me goose bumps.

01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:23.515
Still, there was that awful smell in the library.

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:24.724
Oh, here we go again.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.352
You know very well
what you thought you smelled in the library.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.729
The sickroom smell.

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:33.108
Let's discuss me some other time.

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:35.151
I'm tired.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.779
- Turn out the light.
- No, I'd like it on. Have you seen this?

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:41.658
I told you, I just want to go to sleep.
Good night.

01:08:43.494 --> 01:08:47.038
Well, why be mad at me?
I don't think you killed your mother.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.545
Leave me alone.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.964
- Okay.
- Go to sleep.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.633
Good night, Nellie, my Nell.

01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:00.904
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.781
Don't let it know you're in my room.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.306
Hold my hand, Theo.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.810
And for God's sake, don't scream.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:02.465
Is it over? Do you think it's over?

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.176
Theo. You're breaking my hand.

01:11:25.906 --> 01:11:28.741
This is monstrous. This is cruel.

01:11:28.909 --> 01:11:30.201
It is hurting a child...

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:34.247
...and I will not let anyone,
anything, hurt a child.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.125
I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.627
Well, it has, and poor Theo too.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:44.215
Honestly, it feels like
she's breaking my hand.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:54.225
I will take a lot
from this filthy house for his sake...

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.477
...but I will not go along with hurting a child.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.563
No, I will not.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:05.278
I will get my mouth to open right now,
and I will yell, I will yell, I will yell.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.989
Stop it!

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:15.496
What? What, Nell? What?

01:12:21.962 --> 01:12:23.004
Oh, God.

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:26.966
Oh, God.

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:31.304
Whose hand was I holding?

01:12:58.624 --> 01:12:59.957
Oh, Eleanor.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.335
- Too bad. You just missed it.
- What?

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.837
The Hill House concerto for harp.

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:08.007
Oh? Were you playing the harp?

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.675
It was playing itself.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:13.471
Oh. Naturally. How do you explain it?

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.681
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?

01:13:15.849 --> 01:13:19.936
No, as a matter of fact,
I don't think it is anything supernatural.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:21.896
The self-starting music.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.065
More likely it's in the realm
of the preternatural.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.274
Preternatural?

01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:27.944
Something we don't have
any natural explanation for right now...

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.196
...but probably will have someday.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:35.326
The preternatural of one generation
becomes the natural of the next.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:36.619
You know, not so long ago...

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:39.747
...scientists laughed at the idea
of magnetic attraction.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:44.085
They couldn't explain it,
so they refused to admit it existed.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:49.215
Life is still full of the preternatural.
My mother... Mm.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.551
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:55.263
I don't know what I was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:14:00.101
- You shouldn't be. It's silly to be frightened.
- Silly? You haven't been through it.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.895
This horrible, unknown thing.

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.606
Unknown. That's the key word. Unknown.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.900
When we become involved
in a supernatural event...

01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:11.028
...we're scared out of our wits
just because it's unknown.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:13.072
The night cry of a child.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.784
A face on the wall, knockings, bangings.
What's there to be afraid of?

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:17.994
You weren't threatened.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.163
It was harmless,
like a joke that doesn't come off.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:22.582
- But the child...
- There was no child. Just a voice.

01:14:22.749 --> 01:14:24.041
Oh, worse.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:27.295
Look, let me put it this way.

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:30.298
When people believed the Earth was flat...

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.050
...the idea of a round world scared them silly.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:35.845
Then they found out
how the round world works.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.473
It's the same with the world
of the supernatural.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.766
Until we know how it works...

01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:45.104
...we'll continue to carry around
this unnecessary burden of fear.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:51.569
Supposing it is in my imagination...

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:55.823
...the knocking, the voices, everything.

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:59.785
Every cursed bit of the haunting.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.998
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.210
Well, you can't say that,
because there are three other people here.

01:15:07.377 --> 01:15:08.711
We all resist the idea...

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:12.798
...that what ran through the garden
that first night was a ghost...

01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:16.552
...what banged on the door was a ghost,
what held your hand was a ghost.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.931
But there's certainly something
going on in Hill House.

01:15:20.098 --> 01:15:23.100
We're getting close, Eleanor, very close,
to finding out what it is.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.312
I could say all three of you
are in my imagination.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.813
- None of this is real.
- Sure.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.024
That's the easiest way
to dismiss the supernatural...

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.485
...by pleading insanity
or accusing others of it.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.571
Maybe I am insane.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.074
My mother...

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.578
The night my mother died...

01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:45.289
...she knocked on the wall.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.875
And I didn't come.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:53.339
Eleven years of looking in on her
after every small noise.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.258
That night...

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.427
...my back hurt and my hands.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:01.430
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.

01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:04.934
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:06.936
But this time...

01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:10.439
...she called me...

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:13.025
...and I never answered.

01:16:15.028 --> 01:16:18.197
- Is that how a normal person acts?
- Yes.

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:23.327
You were tired and disgusted.
Eleven years tired and disgusted.

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.246
You're human.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.332
Stop trying to be either a saint or a martyr.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.252
You probably like thinking it was your fault.

01:16:31.878 --> 01:16:35.047
My sister says I wanted Mother to die.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:38.926
I've wondered ever since
if I didn't wake up in the night...

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:41.304
...and hear her...

01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:43.723
...just go back to sleep.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:45.891
It would have been easy.

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:50.104
- I've wondered about it.
- No, you're not capable of that.

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:53.024
You're a fine person, Eleanor.

01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.735
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:02.199
- Do you really think so, John?
- I do indeed.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:07.371
Oh. Goose bumps.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:12.335
There isn't by any chance a cold spot
in this room too, is there?

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:14.754
No, there isn't.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:19.842
Eleanor...

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.190
Journeys end in lovers meeting.

01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:38.027
All I want is to be cherished.

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:41.822
And here we are
listening to that ridiculous harp.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:47.203
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:52.875
Hold apart from this world,
that its lust corrupt thee not.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:57.046
Could you but hear for a moment
the agony...

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.632
...the screaming..."

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.967
Oh, now, get this, congregation.

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.679
"...the dreadful crying out of the lustful...

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:08.599
...damned for eternity in everlasting flame."

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:11.143
- What have you got there?
- I found it at the library.

01:18:11.311 --> 01:18:13.062
He made it himself.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:18.526
Look. "Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:
A Legacy for her Education and Enlightenment.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.736
From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:23.406
...Hill House, 21 st October, 1873."

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:28.536
- But that's today.
- No, tomorrow and 90 years later.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.246
Some nursery book, huh?

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:34.834
"Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.

01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:38.170
Thy father and thy mother."

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:42.341
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:46.679
I can see him now spitting out the words
so they take root in her little mind.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:52.059
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man,
and you made a dirty house.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:54.478
And if you can hear me,
I'm telling you to your face...

01:18:54.646 --> 01:18:57.815
...I hope you spend eternity
in that foul, rotten book...

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.860
...and never stop burning for a minute.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:08.617
- Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll...
- Oh, leave me alone.

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:11.120
Oh, you are a bore.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.955
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures...

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.500
...and send them as Christmas cards
to my New England relatives, huh? Ha, ha.

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:19.587
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas. May your soul rot..."

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:23.340
Close up that book, Luke.
It's enough to set anyone's nerves on edge.

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:26.510
Oh, it's not the book
that's making our Nell nervous.

01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:29.597
She's worried about her apartment.

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:32.224
I didn't know.
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:33.768
She thinks she's being funny.

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.353
Tell me, Dr. Markway,
are you fond of stone lions...

01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.355
...the kind you keep on the mantel?

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:39.690
Shut up, Theo.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:42.818
Do you long for a tiny home,
something smaller than Hill House?

01:19:42.986 --> 01:19:45.029
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:49.992
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.915
- You'd better go with her.
- Wouldn't you rather?

01:19:56.082 --> 01:20:00.085
I said, go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.

01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:08.886
Here you are. Okay, Isolde.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.971
- Tristan wants you inside.
- Leave me alone.

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.807
Stop trying to be the center of attention.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.725
- Come inside.
- You revolt me.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.521
Well. Can't you take a joke?

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.481
I didn't know
you were serious about Markway.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.942
- Of course you did.
- Okay.

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:25.069
But he shouldn't be allowed
to get away with it.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:26.987
Get away with what?

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:30.908
- You're making a fool of yourself over him.
- Suppose I'm not, though.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.953
You'd mind terribly if you turned out
to be wrong for once, wouldn't you?

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.375
- Oh, you poor stupid innocent.
- I'd rather be innocent than like you.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:40.876
Meaning what?

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:43.754
Now who's being stupid and innocent?

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:47.591
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
- Is this another of your crazy hallucinations?

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:49.885
- I'm not crazy.
- Crazy as a loon.

01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:52.972
You expect me to believe you're sane
and the rest of the world is mad?

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:57.685
Why not?
The world is full of inconsistencies.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.311
Unnatural things.

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:03.315
"Nature's mistakes," they're called.
You, for instance.

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:21.000
- Grace.
- A reporter's been telephoning all day.

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.209
He's on your track.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.545
- He's heard about you renting this place.
- Who told him?

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.714
The Dudleys, I bet.
They must have blabbed in town.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.632
Come back with me now, John, please.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.802
If they find out why you're here,
the papers will have a field day with you.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.762
Who are you?

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.140
Grace Markway.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.726
Didn't John tell you he's married?

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.645
- I tried to warn you.
- Well, welcome to our party.

01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:43.898
Well, who are you?

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:46.942
We're, uh, researchers in the field
of psychic phenomena.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.445
Grace, please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:51.739
Oh, stop this insanity, John,
and come back with me.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.073
I can't. Not now.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:56.201
I'm convinced we're on the verge
of a breakthrough.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.413
Here you are, driver. That'll be all.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.875
But I had to come. I had to.

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.461
I've waited such a long time.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.796
I've earned my happiness.

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:12.718
I was afraid this would be your attitude.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:16.305
Well, I'm not leaving here until you've got
sense enough to leave with me.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:18.849
I hope no one minds if I join the ghost hunt.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:23.062
All right, I'll put your things in my room.

01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:26.023
I'll be very disappointed
if I don't see a ghost, John.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.192
Hadn't you better put me
in the ghastly dungeon...

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.361
...or the mysterious secret chamber?

01:22:30.528 --> 01:22:33.322
There are no dungeons,
no secret chambers in Hill House.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.824
In fact, nothing romantic at all.

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:38.535
It's a deadly serious place.

01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:41.830
- Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
- There's the nursery.

01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:46.627
- Eleanor.
- Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:59.348
Grace, you must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:02.518
You may not believe in the supernatural,
but these are physical facts.

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:04.061
Mrs. Markway.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:08.691
Mrs. Markway, please,
don't sleep in the nursery.

01:23:08.858 --> 01:23:10.693
I didn't realize what I was saying.

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:13.529
You insult my intelligence.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:17.491
You don't think I'd believe anything
you ghost hunters might tell me.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:20.744
Well, even so,
you shouldn't sleep in that room.

01:23:20.912 --> 01:23:23.163
It hasn't been opened
since we've been here.

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:27.710
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M., but it's true, the air might be bad.

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:30.087
Oh, poisonous.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.297
I've just remembered. No problem.

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:36.218
I don't have a key to the nursery,
and the Dudleys have gone for the night.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.929
Incidentally,
how'd you get through the gate?

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:42.141
Very supernatural. With a key.

01:23:42.308 --> 01:23:44.685
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
I assure you...

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.188
...and not at all averse to a $5 bill.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.483
Hey, look.

01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:06.165
From your expressions,
I gather that is the dreaded nursery.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.460
And as for the bad air,
it's quite the opposite.

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:12.004
There seems to be a draft.

01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:14.590
Hey, wait a minute, doc.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:18.427
I mean, this is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:21.972
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.767
I haven't seen a damn thing.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.062
I just don't like the way it looks.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:35.235
Now I know who your fiend of Hill House is.
The interior decorator.

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:38.197
Evidently, Mrs. Dudley
doesn't get in here very often.

01:24:38.364 --> 01:24:40.324
Looks the same
as the rest of the house to me.

01:24:40.992 --> 01:24:44.161
No, it's no use, Grace.
The air in here is stale.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:46.538
Well, I can take care of that.

01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:49.750
Only one way to argue with a woman, doc.
Don't.

01:24:50.543 --> 01:24:53.212
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:24:53.379 --> 01:24:55.297
My mother...

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:03.680
Grace, this room is the cold,
rotten heart of the house.

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:05.599
Since you're so foolish, I'll stay with you.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.851
But you're not to be in this room
alone tonight.

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:11.563
John, I can't go on watching you
waste your life on all this nonsense.

01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:15.859
If there is such a thing as a haunted house,
this is my chance to find out.

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:17.194
All right, all right.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.323
Oh, John, my bag.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:24.409
Oh. At least leave the door open, huh?

01:25:24.577 --> 01:25:28.288
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:38.257
What if he does have a wife?
I still have a place in this house.

01:25:38.424 --> 01:25:42.136
I belong. I want to stay here.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.514
It's the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:49.017
He can't make me leave,
not if Hill House means me to stay.

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:50.269
Stop it, Eleanor.

01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:52.062
Go away, Eleanor. Go away.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:56.316
We don't want you anymore. You can't stay.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.986
But I can. I can.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.238
He doesn't make the rules around here.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.031
- Get a blanket.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:06.076
Nell, I'm talking to you.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.704
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter? Didn't you hear Markway?

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:11.665
He doesn't want us to stay here.

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.251
He wants us to spend the night
downstairs in the parlor.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:17.921
Luke and he will take turns
watching on this floor.

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:21.633
Oh, Nell, for Pete's sake, snap out of it.

01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:03.527
- Why aren't you upstairs?
- I needed a drink.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:30.220
- Grace.
- Wait a minute.

01:28:36.519 --> 01:28:39.646
It's nowhere near the nursery.
It's down here.

01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:53.160
It seems to me
we've been on this kick before.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.787
Next vacation
I must really go somewhere else.

01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:15.682
It knows my name.
This time it knows my name.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.268
- I'll have to go out there.
- No!

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:21.813
No! It hasn't hurt me.
Why should it hurt her?

01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:24.149
She might try to do something about it.

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.822
Is it over, Theo? Is it?

01:29:31.657 --> 01:29:34.493
No, I'm so cold.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.578
It's going to start everything all over again.

01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:48.131
It can't get in. It can't get in. Don't let it get in.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.865
Oh, God, it knows I'm here.

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.476
Doc?

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.437
I'll let you have the house cheap.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:26.605
It will go on and on
and come back again until it finds me.

01:31:26.772 --> 01:31:31.109
On and on and on until it finds me.

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:43.455
It's at the nursery.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.041
- You must be crazy.
- I'm going!

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.375
Not with that out there.

01:31:47.543 --> 01:31:50.170
- We have to. She's there.
- Don't be crazy.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.839
- No, you can't.
- I gotta find out if Grace is all right.

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.217
I don't know what that is.
I don't wanna find out...

01:31:55.384 --> 01:31:58.553
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

01:31:58.721 --> 01:32:00.180
- No, don't.
- Cut it out.

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:01.890
I'll come.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.934
I'll come.

01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:07.354
Whatever it wants of me it can have.

01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:17.007
The house is coming down around me.

01:33:17.174 --> 01:33:19.467
The house is destroying itself.

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.529
It's in the nursery.

01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:06.973
Mrs. Markway?

01:34:09.101 --> 01:34:12.604
Please. Please.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:14.898
Mrs. Markway?

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:17.567
Grace, are you...?

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.070
Where is she?

01:34:21.697 --> 01:34:25.617
- Eleanor, where is she? What did you see?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:34:25.785 --> 01:34:27.702
She wasn't here.

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:29.746
- What happened?
- She's gone.

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.415
- Where? How?
- Good God.

01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:34.376
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke...

01:34:34.543 --> 01:34:37.587
...if this is what living in a haunted house
has done to your sense of humor...

01:34:37.755 --> 01:34:39.464
Start with this room, then the whole house.

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:42.217
- Even if we have to tear the place apart.
- You can't do that.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:45.136
If we don't find her,
the police will be around quick enough...

01:34:45.304 --> 01:34:47.514
I'm coming apart a little at a time.

01:34:49.266 --> 01:34:51.393
A little at a time.

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:54.979
Now I know where I'm going.

01:34:55.147 --> 01:35:00.276
I'm disappearing inch by inch
into this house.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:09.994
We killed her. You and I, Hugh Crain.

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:15.750
You and I.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.906
She must be around this house somewhere.

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:51.786
- Doc. Doc. Maybe this is a bad joke, huh?
- Grace isn't the kind of girl who makes jokes.

01:35:51.954 --> 01:35:55.457
You find her. She's your wife.
I'm taking Nell and I'm clearing out of here.

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:57.542
Eleanor. Where is Eleanor?

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:13.933
I want to stay here.

01:36:14.685 --> 01:36:17.479
I want to stay here always.

01:36:20.024 --> 01:36:23.818
I will not be frightened or alone anymore.

01:36:24.403 --> 01:36:28.114
Eleanor! Eleanor!

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.034
Eleanor?

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:32.827
Has anyone checked outside?

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.163
- Eleanor!
- Nell!

01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:36.998
Please, Nell, where are you?

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:49.427
Here I am. Here I am, inside.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:54.808
It's not cold at all, and the smell is gone.

01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:25.880
I've broken the spell of Hill House.

01:37:26.048 --> 01:37:32.470
I'm home. I'm home.

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:38.643
No stone lions for me. I am home.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:13.947
Eleanor!

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:16.407
I will not look back...

01:39:16.575 --> 01:39:19.077
...because then they will know
what I am thinking.

01:39:19.578 --> 01:39:22.872
Eleanor, turn around and come down.

01:39:29.713 --> 01:39:31.422
Now, be very, very careful.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.593
Now, come down.

01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:44.227
All that is gone and left behind.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:47.146
Eleanor, for God's sake!

01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:56.906
Wait a minute, doc.

01:39:57.074 --> 01:40:00.284
- This thing's gonna collapse...
- It can't possibly hold the both of you.

01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:14.257
Just turn around, Eleanor.

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:17.719
Keep hold of the rail and start down slowly.

01:40:49.752 --> 01:40:51.502
Stand still. Don't move.

01:40:53.922 --> 01:40:55.923
Stand perfectly still!

01:40:56.091 --> 01:40:59.093
Nell, do what they say, please!

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.549
I'm coming on the platform.

01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:27.014
Now, come along.

01:42:50.414 --> 01:42:52.665
Now, are you sure, Eleanor?

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:54.917
It was Mrs. Markway.

01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:58.588
Just before I fainted, I looked up,
and there she was above the trapdoor.

01:42:58.755 --> 01:43:00.214
What's more, she's still around.

01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:04.218
I don't know who
or what you really saw, Eleanor.

01:43:04.386 --> 01:43:07.138
But whatever it was,
we can't risk letting it happen again.

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:10.016
- That's why you're leaving right now.
- But I can't leave now.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.436
- I brought her car around. Is she ready?
- She's all packed. Take her suitcase.

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:16.522
Oh, no, please, Luke, let me stay.

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.316
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.

01:43:18.483 --> 01:43:20.693
All it would cost you is just my keep.

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:23.654
Sorry, honey, but you're not the type I keep.

01:43:23.822 --> 01:43:27.366
- I can't leave, I tell you.
- Well, I can't take any more chances.

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:30.494
I realize now what a terrible thing
I was asking of you all.

01:43:30.662 --> 01:43:32.496
Now, you're leaving as quickly as you can.

01:43:32.664 --> 01:43:34.582
Then we'll find Grace
and we'll go to the police.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:35.833
It isn't fair.

01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:38.669
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.

01:43:38.837 --> 01:43:41.047
Now, don't you worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:43.883
- Get where? Get where?
- Why, home, of course.

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:46.761
Back to your own little apartment,
where all your things are.

01:43:47.262 --> 01:43:49.222
I haven't any home.

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.182
I made it up.

01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:54.143
No apartment, no things...

01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:56.229
Everything in all the world
that belongs to me...

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:59.523
...is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.

01:44:00.192 --> 01:44:03.694
So you see,
there's no place you can send me.

01:44:03.862 --> 01:44:05.321
I have to stay here.

01:44:05.489 --> 01:44:07.490
You must have lived somewhere
before you came here.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:11.118
- You had an address where I wrote you.
- My sister's.

01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:13.746
I sleep on a couch in the living room.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.582
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:19.585
Yes, you can, and immediately.

01:44:20.295 --> 01:44:24.215
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.

01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:26.759
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.761
Forget all about this house
as soon as you can.

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:33.307
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.

01:44:34.476 --> 01:44:36.727
I was happy here.

01:44:36.895 --> 01:44:38.646
I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:40.273
Put the bag in the car, Luke.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.066
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.

01:44:42.234 --> 01:44:44.860
- You see?
- Please, Eleanor, there's no time to waste.

01:44:45.028 --> 01:44:46.237
Please let me stay.

01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:48.489
I'm the only one
who can call Mrs. Markway back.

01:44:48.657 --> 01:44:51.659
I was wrong.
I should have sent you home the first night.

01:44:54.705 --> 01:44:56.956
This is the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

01:45:03.505 --> 01:45:04.880
I'm the one it really wants.

01:45:07.384 --> 01:45:09.468
Can't you feel it?

01:45:10.053 --> 01:45:11.554
It's alive.

01:45:11.763 --> 01:45:13.848
Watching...

01:45:14.349 --> 01:45:15.766
...waiting.

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.064
Waiting for me.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.070
I won't go away.

01:45:28.613 --> 01:45:30.740
You will go away. Right now.

01:45:34.786 --> 01:45:36.579
- Oh, no, come on.
- I'll drive. It's my car.

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:38.748
At least, half mine.

01:45:39.791 --> 01:45:42.793
All right, let her. I can't stand here arguing.

01:45:42.961 --> 01:45:45.504
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:50.051
That was wrong of me, I know,
but I'm all right now, honestly.

01:45:50.218 --> 01:45:52.178
I'm sorry.

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:54.138
I'm terribly sorry, really.

01:45:57.768 --> 01:45:59.143
Goodbye.

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:01.270
Let's get moving, huh?

01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:06.692
Theo!

01:46:08.653 --> 01:46:10.821
I thought you weren't gonna say goodbye.

01:46:10.989 --> 01:46:13.699
Oh, Nellie, my Nell, be happy.
Please be happy.

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:16.202
Everything's going to be all right.

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.455
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her,
so don't worry.

01:46:19.623 --> 01:46:21.832
She has my place. It isn't fair.

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:24.418
Goodbye, Eleanor.

01:46:27.756 --> 01:46:29.590
I'll write you.

01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:31.967
Now, drive carefully, huh?

01:46:32.135 --> 01:46:36.180
Goodbye.

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:43.062
Who do I thank for a lovely time?

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.318
Oh, hold it. Markway!

01:46:51.947 --> 01:46:53.781
- The key.
- Key?

01:46:53.949 --> 01:46:55.574
To the gate.

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:57.326
Oh, yes, of course.

01:46:57.536 --> 01:47:01.789
What fools they are.
The house tricks them so easily.

01:47:01.957 --> 01:47:05.751
Just by telling me to go away,
they can't make me leave.

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:07.962
They can't shut me out.

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:10.631
Not if Hill House means me to stay.

01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:12.675
- Nell!
- Eleanor!

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:16.387
Wait!

01:47:16.555 --> 01:47:18.305
Eleanor!

01:47:24.646 --> 01:47:26.439
So now I'm going.

01:47:27.023 --> 01:47:31.861
But I won't go. Hill House belongs to me.

01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:36.282
I knew it. I knew it.

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.951
Hill House doesn't want me to go.

01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:48.294
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:49.879
Let go.

01:47:51.715 --> 01:47:53.424
What are you doing?

01:47:55.385 --> 01:47:59.138
Why don't they stop me?
Can't they see what is happening?

01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:02.850
But it's happening to you, Eleanor.

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:04.643
Yes.

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:07.354
Something at last is really...

01:48:07.522 --> 01:48:11.984
...really, really happening to me.

01:48:44.935 --> 01:48:46.769
She's dead.

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.074
Grace!

01:49:00.242 --> 01:49:03.827
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.

01:49:03.995 --> 01:49:06.205
Well, what were you doing?
What happened?

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.624
That terrible house.

01:49:08.792 --> 01:49:12.670
I woke up and I was frightened,
so I tried to find your room, but I got lost.

01:49:12.837 --> 01:49:14.922
Almost as though
the house was doing it on purpose.

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:17.675
And I ended up in the attic.

01:49:17.842 --> 01:49:20.678
I was only trying to find a way out
when I opened the trapdoor.

01:49:20.845 --> 01:49:22.846
I wasn't trying to frighten her.

01:49:23.014 --> 01:49:26.934
- Didn't you see me?
- No, but Eleanor did.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:29.103
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.

01:49:29.271 --> 01:49:31.063
She did kill her.

01:49:31.606 --> 01:49:34.191
Seeing her is what made Eleanor
lose control of the car.

01:49:34.359 --> 01:49:37.903
Oh, no, no.
She only saw me the very last instant.

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:40.739
The same time I saw her.

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:43.284
I don't even know how I got out here.

01:49:43.827 --> 01:49:46.203
It wasn't your fault.

01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:48.831
Eleanor did it to herself.

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:53.002
It looked to me, anyway,
like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.

01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:59.842
Where the first Mrs. Crain
was also killed in an accident.

01:50:00.385 --> 01:50:02.344
Here's the mark.

01:50:04.514 --> 01:50:07.474
There was something in the car with her,
I'm sure of it.

01:50:07.642 --> 01:50:10.436
Call it what you like,
but Hill House is haunted.

01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:14.356
It didn't want her to leave,
and her poor bedeviled mind...

01:50:14.524 --> 01:50:17.109
...wasn't strong enough to fight it.

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:22.114
- Poor Eleanor.
- Maybe not poor Eleanor.

01:50:22.532 --> 01:50:26.410
It was what she wanted, to stay here.

01:50:26.578 --> 01:50:29.038
She had no place else to go.

01:50:30.332 --> 01:50:33.208
The house belongs to her now too.

01:50:33.376 --> 01:50:35.336
Maybe she's happier.

01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:37.004
You wait here, Grace.

01:50:37.172 --> 01:50:39.673
I'll go and get your things
and call the police.

01:50:39.841 --> 01:50:42.635
No, no. No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might...

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.637
I'll be all right.

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:47.598
The house has what it wants...

01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:50.142
...for a while.

01:50:57.150 --> 01:51:02.237
It ought to be burned down
and the ground sowed with salt.

01:51:07.118 --> 01:51:12.414
Hill House has stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.

01:51:12.582 --> 01:51:17.378
Within, walls continue upright, bricks meet...

01:51:17.545 --> 01:51:21.965
...floors are firm,
and doors are sensibly shut.

01:51:22.133 --> 01:51:26.470
Silence lies steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.
