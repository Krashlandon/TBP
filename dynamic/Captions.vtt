01:28.221 --> 01:29.824
<i>...spirit of our country.</i>

01:29.891 --> 01:31.025
<i>Fellow citizens,</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.160
<i>still today,</i>
<i>on the 19th anniversary</i>

01:33.226 --> 01:35.697
<i>of the war that tore</i>
<i>this great nation apart,</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:38.566
<i>we continue our nationwide</i>
<i>recovery effort.</i>

01:39.399 --> 01:40.802
<i>Right now,</i>

01:40.868 --> 01:43.004
<i>as this country watches</i>
<i>50 of our finest young men</i>

01:43.071 --> 01:44.872
<i>prepare</i>
<i>for the ultimate challenge,</i>

01:44.939 --> 01:48.108
<i>let us join together</i>
<i>in reflection and hope.</i>

01:48.175 --> 01:49.544
<i>We give thanks for the state</i>

01:49.611 --> 01:51.045
<i>and the opportunity</i>
<i>it provides...</i>

01:52.312 --> 01:53.982
<i>...for the order</i>
<i>it has instituted</i>

01:54.048 --> 01:55.148
<i>for the good of society.</i>

01:55.248 --> 01:58.853
<i>May it bring us</i>
<i>all back to prosperity.</i>

01:58.920 --> 02:01.321
<i>We pray for the poor,</i>
<i>the hungry,</i>

02:01.388 --> 02:04.626
<i>the unemployed,</i>
<i>and those without shelter.</i>

02:04.692 --> 02:07.127
<i>Help us transform</i>
<i>hardship into hope,</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:08.730
<i>scarcity into abundance,</i>

02:08.796 --> 02:11.633
<i>- and division into solidarity.</i>
- I just...

02:12.634 --> 02:14.068
I still don't understand.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.238
I think you could probably
still change your mind.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.908
- I don't think it's...
- The back-out date
was yesterday.

02:21.943 --> 02:23.678
But they would let you.

02:23.745 --> 02:24.879
I know it.
The Major, he would...

02:24.946 --> 02:25.947
The Major would what?

02:26.014 --> 02:27.414
You know what
the Major would say.

02:30.752 --> 02:33.521
This is my decision, okay?
Not yours.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.556
This is the best way.
It's the only way.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.191
-If your father was here...
-Okay, but he's not.

02:39.761 --> 02:42.262
ID, please.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.919
You brought the baseball?

03:04.986 --> 03:08.221
-Yeah, I just... I don't know.
-I made you these.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.624
Oatmeal chocolate chip,
your favorite.

03:09.691 --> 03:11.526
Thanks, Mom.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.794
All right, come here, baby.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.932
- I love you.
- I love you too.

03:17.999 --> 03:20.034
-Be a good boy, okay?
-Okay, I will.

03:22.003 --> 03:23.037
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:23.104 --> 03:24.706
All right, I love you better.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.141
No, you don't. That's a fact.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.211
Okay. All right,
I love you, Mom. Bye.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.714
No, wait, wait!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.615
Mom, I can't. I can't.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.984
No!

03:46.527 --> 03:47.562
I know.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.797
It's gonna be okay.

03:49.864 --> 03:52.299
- It's gonna be okay.
- I can't.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.602
Mom, it's just a few days.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.403
I'll see you in a few days.

03:58.206 --> 04:00.742
- I know. I know.
- I can't. I can't.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.081
I gotta let you go, okay?

04:08.549 --> 04:11.185
-Okay.
-Okay. All right, Mom.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.188
Okay. Okay.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.625
Okay. I love you, Mom.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.477
Hey, uh, I'm Ray Garraty.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.948
Pete. Peter McVries.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.049
Nice to meet you.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.988
You ready for this?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.488
- A little jumpy...
- Yeah.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.457
...but maybe that's good?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.728
Hey, what do you weigh?

04:53.795 --> 04:55.428
178.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.898
I'm 177.

04:58.099 --> 05:00.101
They say heavier guys
get tired quicker.

05:00.902 --> 05:02.904
Shit.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.005
Look at Superman.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.340
Yeah, he built.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.044
No body fat
on that guy. Jesus.

05:10.111 --> 05:11.145
He's gonna be tough to beat.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.026
Hey, what's your name?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.360
Stebbins.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.529
Jesus, Stebbins.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.198
You some kinda fitness nut?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.768
Well, I don't think
he wants to talk.

05:33.835 --> 05:34.902
Yeah, all right.
Fine by me.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.070
I don't give a shit.

05:36.137 --> 05:38.706
Hank Olson's the name.
Walking's my game.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.242
Uh, I'm Ray Garraty.
You can call me Ray.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.443
Peter McVries.
You can call me McVries.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.213
I'm Art Baker.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.914
Pleasure to meet y'all.

05:46.981 --> 05:49.784
It's fucking terrifying,
ain't it?

05:49.851 --> 05:53.287
Yeah. I ain't trying
to think about it too much.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.224
Just want to walk and maybe
make some friends.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.165
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.102
Me?

06:08.169 --> 06:10.738
Yeah. You're pacing.
Are you okay?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.206
I'm just getting warmed up.

06:12.273 --> 06:13.473
You have a few hundred miles
to get warmed up

06:13.541 --> 06:15.543
when we start. What's your name?

06:16.644 --> 06:17.778
Curly.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.981
Okay, Curly. How old are you?

06:21.616 --> 06:23.751
Eighteen.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.786
Yeah.
That kid lied to qualify.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.522
Kid, if you're a day over 16,
I eat my fucking shoes.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.658
Look at him.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.760
Poor fucker doesn't know
what the fuck he's doing here.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.395
Now, me?

06:35.462 --> 06:37.565
I know exactly
what the fuck I'm doing here.

06:37.632 --> 06:39.466
Gotta be aggressive.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.468
I... I did my research
on the Major.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.271
He says
you wanna win this thing,

06:43.337 --> 06:45.072
you gotta be raring to rip.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.509
Fuck, boys, I am raring to rip.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.845
"Fuck, boys,
I am raring to rip."

06:53.147 --> 06:54.315
- Hey, fuck you.
- Just sound like

06:54.382 --> 06:56.017
-what you said, asshole.
-Raring to rip.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.251
Yeah.

06:57.318 --> 06:58.653
You sound like my...

06:58.719 --> 07:00.955
my meemaw
on the bowl in morning, man.

07:01.022 --> 07:02.056
Right, guys?

07:06.060 --> 07:07.628
The fuck is a "meemaw"?

07:07.695 --> 07:10.031
Fuck you.
I was just fucking around.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.800
Hey, here he comes.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.911
Shit on a stick.
It's the Major.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.824
Sit down, boys.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.894
- Keep hint 13 in mind.
- Hint number 13.

07:39.961 --> 07:41.195
That's conserve energy
whenever possible.

07:41.262 --> 07:42.330
Yeah, shut up, Olson.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.865
- We all read the rulebook.
- Now,

07:44.932 --> 07:48.736
as I call your name,
step forward and take your tags.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.671
Put 'em around your neck,

07:50.738 --> 07:54.575
and then go back to your place
until I instruct otherwise.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.612
Ewing, James. Number one.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.749
Smith, Patrick. Number four.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.320
Barkovitch, Gary. Number five.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.592
Baker, Arthur. Number six.

08:13.828 --> 08:17.431
White, "Curly" Adam.
Number seven.

08:20.568 --> 08:24.038
Sanders, Rank. Number 19.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.978
McVries, Peter. Number 23.

08:33.481 --> 08:36.317
Stebbins, Billy. Number 38.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.455
Good luck, son.

08:42.923 --> 08:47.395
Olson, Hank. Number 46.

08:47.461 --> 08:51.132
Garraty, Raymond. 47.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.538
Parker, Collie. Number 48.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.011
Harkness, Richard. Number 49.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.315
Fellas, line up by fives,

09:08.382 --> 09:10.251
in no particular order.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.422
Boys,

09:14.488 --> 09:19.293
it takes heavy, heavy sac
to sign up for this contest,

09:19.360 --> 09:20.995
and you've all got it.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.329
You're men now.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.666
As you all know,

09:25.733 --> 09:27.234
our country has been

09:27.301 --> 09:28.769
in a period
of financial struggle

09:28.836 --> 09:30.004
since the war,

09:30.071 --> 09:31.639
and we did the first Long Walk

09:31.705 --> 09:35.476
all those years ago
to inspire and reintegrate

09:35.544 --> 09:37.778
the value of work ethic.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.415
Each year after the event,
there's a spike in production.

09:41.482 --> 09:45.286
We have the means
to return to our former glory.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.955
Our problem now,

09:48.022 --> 09:51.792
is an epidemic of laziness.

09:52.527 --> 09:54.829
You boys are the answer.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.532
The Long Walk is the answer.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.301
When this is broadcast
for all the states,

10:00.367 --> 10:01.936
your inspiration

10:02.002 --> 10:06.207
will continue to elevate
our gross national product.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.211
We will be number one
in the world again!

10:10.277 --> 10:11.645
Yeah!

10:12.847 --> 10:14.448
Now, uh...

10:14.516 --> 10:16.984
I'm not going to go through
the whole rulebook,

10:17.051 --> 10:19.521
but it boils down to this.

10:19.588 --> 10:22.623
Walk until there's
only one of you left.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.693
Maintain a speed
of three miles per hour.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.296
If you fall below the speed,
you get a warning.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.998
If you can't make speed
in ten seconds,

10:31.065 --> 10:33.134
you get an additional warning.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.636
Three warnings,
you get your ticket.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.738
Walk one hour at speed,

10:37.805 --> 10:40.174
one warning is erased and so on.

10:40.241 --> 10:43.010
If you step off the pavement,

10:43.077 --> 10:46.413
you will get your ticket
without warning.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.584
The goal is to last the longest.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.487
There's one winner
and no finish line.

10:53.555 --> 10:55.256
Any of you can win.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.857
Any of you can do it

10:56.924 --> 10:58.926
if you walk long
and steady enough.

10:59.894 --> 11:02.730
If you refuse to give up.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.633
I look at each
and every one of you,

11:06.133 --> 11:08.102
and I see hope.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.171
Now, boys,

11:10.237 --> 11:11.906
who's set to fucking win?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.908
I said...

11:13.974 --> 11:17.811
who's ready to fucking win?

11:29.290 --> 11:31.626
Luck to all,
and remember,

11:32.661 --> 11:35.062
anyone can win.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.475
Hey, Pete.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.711
Pretty fucking desolate.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.613
No shit.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.147
Thought there'd be
more people, I guess.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.549
Major,

13:01.616 --> 13:04.418
he doesn't allow spectators
until the final stretch.

13:04.485 --> 13:05.986
Except for the fucking locals.

13:13.027 --> 13:14.128
Hey.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.563
Smile, boys.

13:16.698 --> 13:17.831
You're on candid camera.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.136
Those aren't very candid.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.971
If I spit at it,
will it go away?

13:24.038 --> 13:25.439
It's fucking creepy.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.479
What is that?

13:32.547 --> 13:33.648
Is that a wheat field?

13:34.381 --> 13:35.416
Best in the world.

13:36.551 --> 13:37.885
Are you from here?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.186
Yeah, I'm from downstate.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.021
Ooh, so you the one.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.389
-What do you mean?
-The one what?

13:42.456 --> 13:44.358
Mr. Garraty here is the walker
from the home state.

13:44.425 --> 13:47.027
<i>Warning. Warning, number 38.</i>

13:50.931 --> 13:51.965
Smart.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.368
What's smart?

13:54.435 --> 13:55.770
Taking a warning
while he's still fresh.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.338
He gets an idea
of what our limit is.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.373
Yeah, it seems
pretty fucking dumb to me.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.709
Well,

14:00.775 --> 14:02.777
big boy's gonna have
no problem walking an hour

14:02.843 --> 14:04.144
without getting another warning.

14:05.346 --> 14:06.781
Then he'll have
this one taken off

14:06.847 --> 14:08.349
to have a clean slate.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.685
That's a good strategy.

14:10.752 --> 14:12.486
Hey, you think it's smart
stuffing your face

14:12.554 --> 14:14.288
with all those
jelly sandwiches this early?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.857
Fuck off.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.125
All right.

14:21.495 --> 14:23.732
-Olson. That's gross.
-What the fuck?

14:23.798 --> 14:25.366
-What?
-What'd he do?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.900
-Gum in...
-Put it in his pocket.

14:26.967 --> 14:27.968
It's fucking gum.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.371
It's not fucking biodegradable.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.639
Don't wanna litter

14:31.706 --> 14:33.407
all over the fucking place.
Jesus Christ.

14:33.474 --> 14:34.542
All right, Hank,
you do realize that

14:34.609 --> 14:36.043
this whole road is
one big piece of litter,

14:36.110 --> 14:37.779
-don't you?
-Yeah, he right.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.884
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Warning, number five.</i>

14:43.951 --> 14:45.953
I got a rock in my fucking shoe.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.221
Whoa!

14:47.287 --> 14:48.690
What the fuck is he doing?

14:52.627 --> 14:53.695
Holy shit!

14:54.995 --> 14:56.430
What the fuck?

14:56.497 --> 14:59.400
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>number five. Second warning.</i>

14:59.466 --> 15:01.268
Fuck, he's still
fucking down there!

15:01.335 --> 15:02.469
What's he doing, man?

15:02.537 --> 15:04.905
Holy shit!

15:04.972 --> 15:06.641
- Go on, get up!
- Get up, Barkovitch.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.108
Jesus Christ!

15:08.175 --> 15:09.577
That dumbfuck's actually gonna
get his fucking ticket.

15:09.644 --> 15:11.513
Hey, come on, get up, man.
Stop playing.

15:11.579 --> 15:15.115
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>number five. Third warning.</i>

15:15.182 --> 15:17.084
- Get the fuck up, Barkovitch!
- Come on, man.

15:24.158 --> 15:25.527
Dumbfuck.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.094
Idiot.

15:28.863 --> 15:30.030
Dumbass.

15:30.899 --> 15:32.132
Better not trip, fucko.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.468
Y'all don't even know.

15:34.536 --> 15:36.370
Just bought myself a rest.

15:36.437 --> 15:39.206
All I see is that
for your lousy 30-second rest,

15:39.273 --> 15:40.809
now you gotta walk
three goddamn hours

15:40.875 --> 15:42.510
without getting a warning.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.211
The hell you need
a rest for, anyway?

15:44.278 --> 15:46.013
We just fucking started.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.982
We'll see who gets
his ticket first, fuckwad.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.484
It's all part
of my fucking plan.

15:50.552 --> 15:51.985
Yeah, well...

15:52.052 --> 15:54.321
his plan and the stuff
that comes out of my asshole,

15:54.388 --> 15:56.056
bear a suspicious resemblance.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.738
What you boys think
about the wish,

16:10.805 --> 16:12.339
and the big prize?

16:12.406 --> 16:15.242
Personally, I can't
stop thinkin'
about all that money.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.478
Rich men don't enter
the kingdom of heaven.

16:17.545 --> 16:18.979
Oh, wow.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.081
All right, Hallelujah,
Brother Garraty!

16:21.148 --> 16:23.016
There'll be refreshments
after the meeting.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.119
Are you
a religious fella, Garraty?

16:26.186 --> 16:29.924
Uh, no, not particularly,
but I'm no money freak either.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.024
Okay.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.695
Look, I'm a religious fella.

16:33.761 --> 16:36.664
I ain't ashamed to admit it.
I'm here for the money.

16:36.731 --> 16:37.998
Know it's easy
to bad-mouth money

16:38.065 --> 16:40.768
when you ain't grown up
dirt poor in Baton Rouge.

16:40.835 --> 16:42.202
Believe me.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.171
Growin' up dirt poor
in Baton Rouge,

16:45.105 --> 16:46.841
it ain't no picnic.

16:46.908 --> 16:49.544
It's one big, sweaty hog-fest.

16:49.611 --> 16:52.547
Listen, I wouldn't mind
havin' some money, but...

16:52.614 --> 16:54.682
there's more important things.

16:54.749 --> 16:57.552
This Walk doesn't matter,
and the prize,
it certainly doesn't matter.

16:57.619 --> 16:58.953
What?

16:59.052 --> 17:00.588
That's some bullshit, Garraty.

17:00.655 --> 17:02.089
Okay.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.092
All right, well,
look at it like this.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.361
When the system backs people
into a corner,

17:07.427 --> 17:09.363
points to an escape hatch,
and says,

17:09.429 --> 17:11.064
"That's the only way out."

17:11.131 --> 17:12.600
Of course, we're all gonna
try to go through it.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.201
We've been set up to believe
it's the only way,

17:14.268 --> 17:15.904
the honorable way.

17:15.970 --> 17:18.272
I mean, even though
only 50 of us get picked
in the lottery,

17:18.338 --> 17:20.073
all of the boys
in this country put in for it.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.709
I'm not exaggerating.

17:21.776 --> 17:23.443
Everybody puts in for it,

17:23.511 --> 17:25.112
even though it's not required,

17:25.178 --> 17:27.447
'cause we're all
so fucking desperate.

17:27.515 --> 17:28.616
What does that tell you?

17:28.683 --> 17:30.552
What?

17:30.618 --> 17:33.253
Nobody signs up for this.
Not really.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.590
It's not smart to talk bad
about the Long Walk.

17:35.657 --> 17:36.891
That's dissent,

17:36.958 --> 17:38.158
- and it's punishable by...
- Arrest me.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.961
You gonna arrest him?

17:40.028 --> 17:42.396
Didn't think so.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.733
No, no, no,
you got a point, Garraty.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.802
They say we have a choice
to sign up for the lottery,

17:47.869 --> 17:50.237
but do any of you know
anyone ever who hasn't?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.273
Exactly.

17:54.509 --> 17:56.243
But I don't agree
with you about money.

17:57.045 --> 17:58.947
Baker's right.

17:59.013 --> 18:00.113
It may not be
the most important thing,

18:00.180 --> 18:02.316
but it's pretty fuckin'
high up there.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.918
The right person could do
a hell of a lot of good

18:03.985 --> 18:05.653
with the right amount of money.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.989
Yeah, but how many people
do you know
with a hella lotta money

18:08.056 --> 18:09.323
who are doin'
a hella lotta good?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.258
In my opinion, it's a myth.

18:11.325 --> 18:13.928
Won't be a myth when I win.

18:13.995 --> 18:15.930
That's exactly
what I want that money for.

18:26.908 --> 18:28.009
Smoke?

18:28.076 --> 18:29.242
No, I'm okay.

18:30.778 --> 18:32.814
Yeah, I don't smoke neither.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.381
- Figured I'd learn.
- Hmm.

18:38.953 --> 18:39.988
Hey.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.956
Hey, hint 10?

18:43.057 --> 18:44.191
"Save your wind.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.693
"If you smoke ordinarily,

18:45.760 --> 18:46.894
"try not to do so

18:46.961 --> 18:48.630
- "on the Long Walk."
- Who cares?

18:48.696 --> 18:49.897
Will you shut
the fuck up, Olson?

18:49.964 --> 18:51.733
It is crap, though. It is crap.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.467
It is pretty shitty.
Anyone else want this?

18:53.534 --> 18:55.003
-I don't smoke.
-Bring it here, man.

18:55.069 --> 18:56.169
Oh!

18:56.236 --> 18:57.972
A religious fella smokes,
does he?

18:58.039 --> 19:00.240
Hey. Hey, ain't nothin'
in the Bible
about no tobacco, now.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.476
- Really?
- Okay.

19:02.543 --> 19:04.045
-Let me give you a light.
-Watch where the fuck

19:04.112 --> 19:05.680
you're going,
you fucking dipshit.

19:05.747 --> 19:07.048
What's his problem, right, boys?

19:07.115 --> 19:08.181
Hey, I'm Harkness.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.349
Hey, Harkness.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.053
You're Ray Garraty,
hometown boy. Number 47.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.921
-Yeah.
-McVries, strong, 23.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.724
I... I suppose you're wonderin'

19:16.791 --> 19:18.893
why I'm writin' down
everybody's names and numbers.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.729
Mm-mmm. No, actually,
I wasn't wonderin'.

19:21.796 --> 19:23.163
Maybe 'cause you
with the squads.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.333
Me? No, no, no.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.769
I'm writin' a book, you see?

19:27.835 --> 19:29.403
A book about the Long Walk.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.438
-I see that.
-Yeah.

19:31.506 --> 19:34.542
Book about the Long Walk
from the insider's
point of view?

19:34.609 --> 19:36.376
Make me rich.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.847
Yo, if you win, you won't need
a book to make you rich.

19:39.914 --> 19:41.616
Yeah, I mean,
I suppose not, but...

19:41.683 --> 19:43.584
...still make one heck

19:43.651 --> 19:45.385
of an interesting book, I think.

20:04.672 --> 20:06.273
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Warning, number seven.</i>

20:06.339 --> 20:07.875

All right?

Keep movin'.

22:02.056 --> 22:04.692
One of our comrades
has fallen.

22:04.759 --> 22:08.262
Let's remember him fondly
and celebrate his bravery.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.031
There will be many more,

22:10.097 --> 22:13.668
but none quite as glory-filled
as the very first,

22:13.734 --> 22:15.169
and the very last.

22:15.937 --> 22:18.739
Today, we walk for Curly.

22:18.806 --> 22:20.007
Let's hear it, boys!

22:20.074 --> 22:21.341
For Curly!

22:21.408 --> 22:22.777
Goddamn right!

22:25.179 --> 22:26.280
Hey, what is it?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.481
You and the Major.

22:34.856 --> 22:37.357
Canteen, 47 callin' for canteen.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.535
Hey, why'd you touch
that carbine?

22:47.602 --> 22:49.170
Like knockin' on wood, I guess.

22:51.806 --> 22:53.241
You a dear boy, Ray.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.014
I gotta take a leak.

23:00.982 --> 23:02.382
Watch out, boys!

23:02.449 --> 23:03.584
Incoming!

23:05.286 --> 23:06.419
-Oh, what the hell?
-Oh, man.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.588
- It got on my shoes!
- Whoa,

23:07.655 --> 23:08.656
watch where you point
that thing, man!

23:08.723 --> 23:10.490
Jesus fucking Christ, McVries!

23:10.558 --> 23:12.526
Now, that is a relief.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.568
Hey.

23:20.635 --> 23:21.769
You gettin' tired?

23:22.970 --> 23:24.437
No.

23:24.505 --> 23:26.340
Been tired
for quite a while now.

23:27.174 --> 23:28.441
What, you mean you're not?

23:28.910 --> 23:30.077
Listen, Ray.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.579
It's like the Major said...

23:31.646 --> 23:33.648
ain't no finish line.

23:33.714 --> 23:36.250
That's the biggest
mind-fuck in this race.

23:36.317 --> 23:39.020
-Would you agree?
-I wouldn't disagree.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.521
It's just, you know,
I'm already feelin' it.

23:40.588 --> 23:41.856
I'm not sure
how much longer I can...

23:41.923 --> 23:43.758
No, no, no, Ray, Ray.
Come on, now.

23:43.824 --> 23:45.693
That's how everybody thinks.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.362
But you see, we,
we gotta think different.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.797
We don't think about
makin' it to the end,

23:49.864 --> 23:51.532
we think about moments.

23:51.599 --> 23:54.302
Just makin' it
to the next moment.

23:54.368 --> 23:56.771
Yeah. What do we think
about now?

23:56.837 --> 23:58.773
Well, that one's easy.

23:58.839 --> 24:01.676
We just gotta make it through
this goddamn heat, boy.

24:01.742 --> 24:03.010
Oh, my God.

24:03.077 --> 24:04.278
- It's a scorcher.
- You got that right.

24:06.681 --> 24:09.050
Hey, Ray.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.218
What you said back there
about the Long Walk,

24:11.285 --> 24:13.688
and how no one ever
really volunteers...

24:13.754 --> 24:15.056
Yeah?

24:15.122 --> 24:16.657
Where'd it come from?

24:18.025 --> 24:19.327
M... my dad said it.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.930
Your dad's
one smart motherfucker.

24:24.265 --> 24:25.465
Yeah, I think so, too.

24:27.401 --> 24:29.670
Hey, just go on dancing with me
like this forever, <i>compadre...</i>

24:29.737 --> 24:31.172
and I'll never tire.

24:31.238 --> 24:33.007
Hey, we'll scrape
our shoes on the stars,

24:33.074 --> 24:35.475
and hang upside down
from the moon.

24:36.043 --> 24:38.379
You a poet, Pete?

24:38.446 --> 24:40.581
In days past, I would've liked
to have been a...

24:40.648 --> 24:41.916
a songwriter.

24:43.451 --> 24:44.552
But it ain't those days,

24:44.618 --> 24:46.554
so I guess I'm stuck here
riffing for you.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.089
Hope it's not too bad.

24:48.155 --> 24:50.424
- Ain't too bad.
- Hey, bud.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.094
You're, uh,
Raymond Garraty, right?

24:54.494 --> 24:55.529
I'm Pearson.

24:57.064 --> 24:59.367
I think you got
a secret admirer over there.

25:00.768 --> 25:02.703
Ray, Ray, I love you!

25:02.770 --> 25:04.772
Come on, man.
She must be like 14.

25:04.839 --> 25:06.574
I love you, Ray!

25:06.640 --> 25:08.042
Maybe she just wants
your autograph, that's all.

25:08.109 --> 25:09.543
Hey, I thought
spectators weren't

25:09.610 --> 25:10.277
fuckin' allowed,
'cause we're on television
and shit.

25:10.344 --> 25:11.379
Get out of here, man.

25:11.445 --> 25:14.248
Come on.
Don't be a sourpuss, Olson.

25:14.315 --> 25:17.084
The boy's got a fan.
Let him have his fun.

25:17.151 --> 25:20.054
-Thanks, Pete.
-Hey, don't thank me too much.

25:20.121 --> 25:21.422
I like you,

25:21.489 --> 25:23.524
but if you fall over,
I won't pick you up.

25:25.126 --> 25:26.460
We're all in this
together, right?

25:27.828 --> 25:29.864
No harm in keeping
each other amused.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.269
Do you know what?
I take it back.

25:35.336 --> 25:36.804
They say you shouldn't
make friends on the Long Walk,

25:36.871 --> 25:39.373
but fuck it.
I sorta like you three.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.574
Even you, Olson.

25:40.641 --> 25:42.743
-Fuck off.
-No, I'm serious.

25:42.810 --> 25:44.478
Hey, hey, hey,
a short friendship

25:44.545 --> 25:45.880
is better than
no friendship, right?

25:45.946 --> 25:46.981
That's what
I've been sayin', man.

25:47.048 --> 25:49.717
That's what I'm be sayin'.

25:49.784 --> 25:51.952
Come on, man.
Let's be Musketeers.

25:52.019 --> 25:54.355
How the fuck are
we gonna be Musketeers?

25:54.422 --> 25:56.891
- There's four of us.
- Come on, now.

25:56.957 --> 25:58.325
We stick together
till we're all that's left.

25:58.392 --> 25:59.827
How about that?

25:59.894 --> 26:01.662
-All for one!
-And one for all.

26:01.729 --> 26:04.598
Nah. And again.
I need to hear it louder.

26:04.665 --> 26:06.734
-All for one!
-And one for all!

26:06.801 --> 26:08.436
-Hell, yeah!
-Yeah, baby, you know...

26:08.503 --> 26:10.271
-Yeah, not you, not you.
-You need...

26:10.337 --> 26:11.939
You know y'all sound like
a bunch of
fucking queers, right?

26:12.006 --> 26:14.275
Oh, you trying to...
You trying to suck
this dick, Barkovitch?

26:14.341 --> 26:16.644
Sounds like you wanna eat
my fuckin' meat, you sick fuck.

26:16.710 --> 26:17.778
Fuck! Ah!

26:18.879 --> 26:20.247
My legs feel funny.

26:20.314 --> 26:22.283
It's like the muscles are
all turning baggy.

26:22.349 --> 26:23.584
Hey, relax.

26:23.651 --> 26:24.952
Happened to me a few miles back.

26:25.019 --> 26:26.153
It passes.

26:26.220 --> 26:28.355
<i>Warning. Number one.</i>

26:33.027 --> 26:34.328
Shit.

26:34.395 --> 26:35.629
Hey, man, that's Ewing.

26:35.696 --> 26:37.998
Like, he's shaking and shit.

26:38.065 --> 26:40.868
<i>Warning. Number one.</i>
<i>Second warning.</i>

26:42.937 --> 26:45.306
Must have some medical shit
he didn't report.

26:45.372 --> 26:47.475
-Hey, back off, Barkovitch!
-Hey!

26:47.542 --> 26:50.811
Barkovitch, go peddle
your papers, little man. Go.

26:50.878 --> 26:53.582
<i>Warning. Third warning.</i>
<i>Number one.</i>

26:57.586 --> 26:59.820
Why won't they just
fucking end it?

27:05.459 --> 27:07.161
Hey, y'all should be
fuckin' smilin'.

27:07.228 --> 27:09.296
The odds just went up
for us. Yeah?

27:12.366 --> 27:14.435
I keep hoping
that part gets easier.

27:15.570 --> 27:16.904
That's what I'm afraid of.

28:03.951 --> 28:05.753
Probably a nice place to live.

28:05.819 --> 28:08.956
God, spare me
nice places to live.

28:09.023 --> 28:10.224
You know,
if I ever get out of this,

28:10.291 --> 28:12.059
I'm gonna fornicate
till my cock turns blue.

28:12.126 --> 28:13.761
Okay.

28:13.827 --> 28:15.362
I've never been
so horny in my life
as I am right this minute.

28:15.429 --> 28:17.431
-Ain't that strange?
-It is fuckin' strange.

28:17.498 --> 28:18.699
Yeah.

28:18.766 --> 28:19.934
- Just a little bit, right?
- Uh-huh.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.235
Hey, I could even get horny
for you, Ray...

28:21.302 --> 28:22.403
if you didn't smell
like my mom's asshole.

28:22.469 --> 28:23.904
Hey, hey... You're gonna
get me a fuckin'...

28:23.971 --> 28:25.239
-Oh, my God...
--...gonna get my ticket...

28:25.306 --> 28:27.141
-...that smells so...
-...my man.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.876
Yo, Long Dong Silver, that's me.

28:28.943 --> 28:30.778
I'll fuck my way
across the seven seas.

28:30.844 --> 28:32.813
- Hmm.
- Nah. Sinbad.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.315
What?

28:34.381 --> 28:36.383
You're thinking of Sinbad.
You know, Sinbad the Sailor?

28:36.450 --> 28:37.586
That's the seven seas guy.

28:37.652 --> 28:38.886
Did you not hear
that I don't give a fuck?

28:38.953 --> 28:39.887
-Long John Silver lives...
-I'm trying to fuck.

28:39.954 --> 28:41.355
...on fucking Treasure Island.

28:41.422 --> 28:42.423
- What the fuck?
- Just a fucking nerdy thing

28:42.489 --> 28:43.558
-to say, you know?
-What, I'm a nerd

28:43.625 --> 28:44.659
'cause I read fuckin' books
and shit?

28:44.725 --> 28:46.961
-I guess so.
-Hey, hey...

28:47.027 --> 28:49.730
think that shit-ass
has walked off his warnings yet?

28:49.797 --> 28:51.365
I mean, he must've.

28:51.432 --> 28:53.801
Been what? Three hours, maybe.

28:53.867 --> 28:56.538
Yes, I'm fucking clean
on warnings, fuckfaces.

28:57.505 --> 28:58.839
-Okay.
-Good ear.

29:00.841 --> 29:02.209
Hey, what is that?

29:03.210 --> 29:05.112
This is raw ground venison.

29:05.179 --> 29:06.413
It's good energy.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.616
Oh, God.

29:07.682 --> 29:09.316
You off your trolley, Musketeer.

29:09.383 --> 29:10.585
Gonna puke all over the place.

29:10.652 --> 29:13.020
Hey, in France,
they call it steak tartare.

29:13.087 --> 29:14.623
-It's a delicacy.
-Uh-huh. Mmm.

29:14.689 --> 29:17.659
Ooh, yeah, well, in France,
they ain't so smart.

29:17.726 --> 29:19.426
Yeah, Renoir
and Camus were idiots.

29:19.493 --> 29:20.695
Look, I don't know
about any of that

29:20.761 --> 29:22.263
fucking Camus shit,

29:22.329 --> 29:23.964
but I do know that they eat

29:24.031 --> 29:26.500
the fucking legs
of frogs over there.

29:26.568 --> 29:28.269
That shit is fuckin' disgusting.

29:28.335 --> 29:29.671
-That ain't disgusting.
-Tastes like chicken wings,
apparently.

29:29.738 --> 29:31.205
- God.
- You got that right.

29:31.272 --> 29:32.607
-Ow! Sh...
-Hey. Keep up, keep up,

29:32.674 --> 29:33.675
keep up. Keep walking. Come on.

29:33.742 --> 29:35.042
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I'll keep you up.

29:35.109 --> 29:38.045
I'm all right. It's the...
fucking jelly-leg thing.

29:38.112 --> 29:39.446
-Okay.
-Kinda went away for a while,

29:39.514 --> 29:40.848
but it's coming back now.

29:40.914 --> 29:43.050
I just don't know
what the hell I gotta adjust.

29:43.117 --> 29:45.185
Maybe stop talking
so much, buddy.

29:45.252 --> 29:46.987
-What's your speed, Olson?
-Relax, okay?

29:47.054 --> 29:48.088
Sure.

29:49.023 --> 29:50.391
It's 3.4.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.226
Yeah, me, too.
I'm assuming you guys?

29:52.293 --> 29:53.794
Let's shave .3 off.

29:55.530 --> 29:58.232
-All right.
-Oh, shit.

29:58.299 --> 29:59.634
-Holy fuck.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:59.701 --> 30:00.834
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

30:00.901 --> 30:02.369
I really feel
the fuckin' difference.

30:02.436 --> 30:03.638
-Hey, so do I.
-Yeah.

30:03.705 --> 30:04.972
-Me, too.
-I'm feeling better, too.

30:05.039 --> 30:07.875
Let's not stay here
for too long, though.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.343
You know,
in the meantime, Pete...

30:10.444 --> 30:11.845
wanna tell us about that scar?

30:16.417 --> 30:18.018
Baker's right.
Maybe we just, um,

30:18.919 --> 30:19.987
we keep quiet.

30:21.623 --> 30:22.657
Okay.

30:27.729 --> 30:28.996
Oh.

30:29.063 --> 30:30.864
Come on, don't be
a fuckin' litterbug, Garraty.

30:30.931 --> 30:32.600
-Go fuck yourself, Olson.
-It's bad for
the motherfuckin' ozone layer.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.101
Shit! Shit!

30:34.168 --> 30:35.903
-Goddamn it. Hey, hey, hey.
-Oh, God.

30:35.969 --> 30:38.072
It's all right.
You're gonna get more rations.
You're fine.

30:38.138 --> 30:39.440
Yeah, but...

30:40.642 --> 30:43.110
that was it for me today,
'cause...

30:43.177 --> 30:45.714
well, I'm allergic to the SPAM.
I gave all that shit away.

30:47.348 --> 30:48.949
Fuck.

30:49.016 --> 30:50.552
Fuckin' hungry.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.188
Here you go, Hank.

40:44.245 --> 40:46.113

41:34.996 --> 41:36.163
-That's it.
-Okay.

41:36.897 --> 41:38.366

41:38.432 --> 41:40.167

41:50.945 --> 41:51.979
Top of the hill.

41:52.980 --> 41:54.015

41:55.082 --> 41:57.418
No, no, no! Don't slow down.

41:57.485 --> 41:58.919
Do not slow down.

41:58.986 --> 42:00.221

42:00.287 --> 42:01.622
You'll catch your breath.

42:05.493 --> 42:07.094
Pete, I didn't mean
what I said back there, okay?

42:07.161 --> 42:08.763
-Forget it, man.
-No, I owe you an apology.

42:08.829 --> 42:11.098
-Forget it.
-Pete, I owe you...

42:11.165 --> 42:13.601

42:13.667 --> 42:15.636
-It's all right.

42:15.703 --> 42:16.937
It's all right.

42:17.004 --> 42:18.039
Okay.

42:19.340 --> 42:21.809
Hey, you know
I didn't mean it, right?

42:21.876 --> 42:23.310
It's all good.

42:23.377 --> 42:25.146
It's all good. Let it out.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.247
Okay.

42:26.313 --> 42:28.382
-Don't be fucking dumb.
-Okay.

42:28.449 --> 42:30.718
-Keep the pace.
-Okay.

42:30.785 --> 42:32.186
-Keep the pace.
-Okay.

42:34.221 --> 42:35.623
What about the rest of them?

42:35.689 --> 42:37.391
The Musketeers?

42:38.492 --> 42:39.760
Musketeers are all good.

42:39.827 --> 42:40.861
Okay.

42:46.801 --> 42:48.335
Keep moving.

42:48.402 --> 42:49.804
Keep moving.

42:49.870 --> 42:51.272
You got it.

42:51.338 --> 42:52.373
You got it.

43:07.188 --> 43:08.489
All he needs

43:08.557 --> 43:10.291
is a pitchfork.

43:14.529 --> 43:16.297
Talk to me, Pete. I'm fading.

43:18.499 --> 43:19.967
You think you'll win, Ray?

43:21.102 --> 43:23.104
Uh, I, uh...

43:23.904 --> 43:24.939
I need to.

43:25.940 --> 43:27.775
We all do.

43:27.842 --> 43:29.877
Yeah... Yeah, to survive.
I get it, but...

43:30.945 --> 43:33.013
I need to for other reasons.

43:33.080 --> 43:35.149
Okay. But you think you will?

43:37.218 --> 43:38.285
No, Pete.

43:39.086 --> 43:40.121
No, I don't.

43:42.189 --> 43:43.224
How about you?

43:44.526 --> 43:46.227
I stopped thinking
I had any real chance

43:46.293 --> 43:47.596
around 11 last night.

43:49.363 --> 43:51.065
You know, I had an idea

43:51.132 --> 43:54.168
that when
the first guy fell off,

43:54.235 --> 43:56.203
the soldiers were pointing
their guns,

43:56.270 --> 43:58.072
and when they pulled
the triggers,

43:58.139 --> 44:01.510
little pieces of paper
with the word "bang"
will pop out.

44:01.576 --> 44:03.177
The Major would go
"April Fools,"

44:03.244 --> 44:05.547
and we'll all go home.

44:05.614 --> 44:07.681
Do you know what I'm saying?

44:07.748 --> 44:09.750
Yeah, Pete, I do.

44:10.651 --> 44:12.319
Yeah.

44:12.386 --> 44:15.456
Yeah, it took me
a while to realize
the real gut truth of this.

44:16.190 --> 44:17.825
This is walk or die...

44:18.759 --> 44:19.960
simple as that.

44:21.128 --> 44:22.696
Not survival
of the physically fittest.

44:22.763 --> 44:24.865
If it was, I'd have
a good chance, but...

44:27.101 --> 44:29.604
There are mothers
who'd lift a fucking car

44:29.670 --> 44:31.672
if their kid
was pinned underneath.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.376
The brain, Garraty.

44:36.810 --> 44:38.345
Not man or God,

44:38.412 --> 44:40.481
it's something
in the fucking brain.

44:42.651 --> 44:43.817
I don't have that.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.956
I don't want
to beat people that badly.

44:49.023 --> 44:51.660
And I think,
when the time comes,

44:52.693 --> 44:54.728
when I'm tired enough,

44:54.795 --> 44:56.463
I think I'll just sit down.

44:58.199 --> 45:00.067
I hope that's not true, Pete.

45:04.506 --> 45:05.973
I'll outlast Barkovitch, though.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.877
Ah! That I can do at least.

45:09.944 --> 45:12.246
We can both do that.

45:13.981 --> 45:16.317
How many people are left?

45:16.383 --> 45:19.320
Word came up,
we lost 14 last night.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.188
Which means 18 left, I think.

45:22.356 --> 45:23.592
It's thinnin' out, Ray.

45:24.992 --> 45:26.827
More than 5% chance now.

45:47.748 --> 45:49.116
Did you walk off
your warnings?

45:49.183 --> 45:50.784
Yes, I did.

45:50.851 --> 45:52.987
Ray, you know
it's true morning now.

45:53.053 --> 45:54.288
You gonna tell me?

45:56.023 --> 45:58.593
What a dipshit state this is.

45:58.660 --> 46:01.630
Fucking trees and one-horse
towns everyplace.

46:01.696 --> 46:03.864
Is there a city
in this whole fucking place?

46:03.931 --> 46:05.132
You know, it's funny, Collie,

46:05.199 --> 46:07.334
we like to breathe
fresh air instead of smog.

46:07.401 --> 46:10.804
Ain't no smog
in Sioux Falls,
you fucking hick.

46:10.871 --> 46:12.373
Ah! Right. No smog,
just a lot of,

46:12.439 --> 46:14.208
-what is it, hot air?
-Now, now, boys.

46:14.275 --> 46:16.143
Come on. Let's settle this
like gentlemen.

46:16.210 --> 46:17.378
First one to get
his head blown off

46:17.444 --> 46:18.513
has to buy
the other one a beer, huh?

46:18.580 --> 46:20.147
-How about that?
-I... I don't like beer.

46:21.516 --> 46:22.651
Fuckin' bumpkin.

46:24.918 --> 46:26.554
He's buggy.

46:26.621 --> 46:28.322
You know,
you seem buggy too, Ray.

46:28.389 --> 46:29.624
-Hmm.
-Fuck me.

46:29.691 --> 46:32.393
Is everyone buggy this morning?

46:32.459 --> 46:34.562
I bet Olson's got bugs too.
Hey, Olson.

46:35.796 --> 46:36.897
- Hey, Hank!
- Hey, come on,

46:36.964 --> 46:38.866
come on, McVries.
Leave him alone, man.

46:38.932 --> 46:40.000
He ain't had a good night.

46:40.067 --> 46:41.168
He ain't doing so well, either.

46:41.235 --> 46:43.705
Hey, how'd you sleep today? Huh?

46:43.772 --> 46:45.839
'Cause I slept
just fucking great.

46:45.906 --> 46:47.474
Hey, Olson.

46:47.542 --> 46:48.643
You wanna go for a walk?

46:49.410 --> 46:50.444
Go to hell.

46:51.613 --> 46:52.846
Come on. What?

46:52.913 --> 46:55.215
-What'd you say?
-Go to hell. I said fucking...

46:55.282 --> 46:56.518
Go to hell!

46:59.587 --> 47:00.888
Just trying
to keep it interesting.

47:00.954 --> 47:03.390
- Hmm.

You're too emotional, Garraty.

47:53.173 --> 47:54.308
That'll get you in the end.

47:54.375 --> 47:55.610
You know, you hardly talk,

47:55.677 --> 47:57.077
it's just fucking garbage!

I think a fucking

like that would just probably
win the whole thing.

48:02.717 --> 48:03.852
Harkness, man.

48:04.853 --> 48:06.086
Poor ol' Harkness.

48:06.153 --> 48:08.455
Why don't you write him
a fucking poem, then?

48:08.523 --> 48:09.791
Actually, you know what?

48:09.858 --> 48:12.459
You should write him
a song, songwriter.

48:12.527 --> 48:14.061
Why don't you kiss
my ass, killer?

48:14.128 --> 48:15.963
Hey, don't fucking say
that shit, man.

48:16.029 --> 48:17.431
You're fucking wrong
to say that, man.

48:17.498 --> 48:19.567
I'm not fucking wrong.
You're fucking wrong, man.

48:19.634 --> 48:21.536
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

48:23.705 --> 48:26.006
I got plans for you,

48:26.073 --> 48:27.107
Okay?

48:39.754 --> 48:41.121
That's good, Ray.

48:42.389 --> 48:44.958
Remember, we can't
have it both ways.

48:48.596 --> 48:50.832
Hey, Hank.

48:50.899 --> 48:52.801
I'm sorry
for busting your balls, man.

48:54.401 --> 48:55.570
I really am.

49:00.842 --> 49:04.044
Give yourselves due kudos, boys.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.479
Let's hear it.

49:05.547 --> 49:07.782
You made it 100 miles.

49:07.849 --> 49:10.217
That's a goddamn accomplishment!

49:13.187 --> 49:16.089
Keep on. The prize awaits.

49:18.459 --> 49:21.028
I mean, how the heck
he always look so fresh?

49:21.094 --> 49:22.229
He even human?

49:23.096 --> 49:24.632
It's not a trick.

49:24.699 --> 49:27.401
The Major sleeps at night,
after supper.

49:27.468 --> 49:28.903
He even showers.

49:30.037 --> 49:31.506
That ain't fair.

49:31.573 --> 49:33.140
It's not about fair.

49:35.209 --> 49:37.478
How are ya, fucking fuckhead?

49:37.545 --> 49:39.246
You goddamn bag.

49:41.716 --> 49:44.251
You gettin' sick, Stebbins?

49:44.318 --> 49:46.186
Oh, wouldn't you
like that, Garraty?

49:47.421 --> 49:48.656
Just allergies.

49:50.090 --> 49:51.893
I get 'em every spring.

49:51.960 --> 49:54.729
Oh, shit! He's running for it!

49:54.796 --> 49:56.598
<i>- Warning, 31.</i>
- Oh, boy! Come on, now!

50:00.234 --> 50:01.936
Fuck, man, that just woke me up!

50:16.316 --> 50:17.785
Ooh!

50:17.852 --> 50:20.822
Boy, I'd kill
for a foot massage right now.

50:22.757 --> 50:24.424
If I win this,

50:24.491 --> 50:26.561
if I win, I swear to God,

50:26.628 --> 50:28.028
I might be tempted
to use my wish

50:28.095 --> 50:30.030
for a foot massage
right there on the road.

50:30.999 --> 50:32.065
You serious, Baker?

50:32.132 --> 50:33.801
No, man. Of course not.

50:35.269 --> 50:38.071
I'm asking
to have one of them, uh...

50:38.138 --> 50:39.541
What you call 'em?

50:39.607 --> 50:41.709
- One of them space rockets.
- Huh.

50:41.776 --> 50:43.645
Yeah, those space rockets
take me to the moon.

50:43.711 --> 50:45.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I always wanted

50:45.212 --> 50:46.648
to go to the moon.

50:46.714 --> 50:48.917
Anywhere's better than here.

50:48.983 --> 50:51.351
Hey, you know,
that's not a bad wish, Baker.

50:51.418 --> 50:54.454
Remember that one kid that,
uh, well, he wished for, uh...

50:54.522 --> 50:55.957
I think it was a pet elephant?

50:56.024 --> 50:57.491
Yeah.

50:57.559 --> 50:58.560
Yeah, and they gave it to him.

50:58.626 --> 50:59.928
Uh-huh.

50:59.994 --> 51:01.461
They brought it out
with a saddle and everything,

51:01.529 --> 51:02.830
and he just rode it home.

51:02.897 --> 51:03.932
Yeah.

51:05.567 --> 51:07.434
They really will give you
anything you want.

51:09.236 --> 51:11.639
That's why
I'm asking to go to the moon.

51:11.706 --> 51:13.675
I gonna wish
for 10 naked ladies.

51:13.741 --> 51:16.343
Oh, shit. There he is.
I thought we lost you.

51:17.077 --> 51:19.179
Well, I'm fine.

51:19.246 --> 51:21.148
The fuck you gonna do
with 10 naked ladies?

51:21.214 --> 51:23.250
Uh, you said you were
gonna be nice, McVries.

51:23.317 --> 51:24.852
That's a stupid
fucking wish, Olson.

51:24.919 --> 51:26.353
How is that
a stupid fucking wish?

51:26.420 --> 51:27.822
You fruity or something?

51:27.889 --> 51:28.957
No, that's not the point, Olson.

51:29.023 --> 51:30.024
All I'm saying
is that when you win,

51:30.123 --> 51:31.124
you get like
a gazillion dollars.

51:31.191 --> 51:32.827
You can pay for 10 naked ladies

51:32.894 --> 51:34.529
to come over to your house
whenever you'd like.

51:34.596 --> 51:37.264
It's just, you know,

51:37.331 --> 51:38.800
when you win,
you should wish for something

51:38.866 --> 51:39.934
that you can't pay for.

51:40.001 --> 51:42.269
No. I don't wanna
have to fucking pay

51:42.336 --> 51:44.204
for my naked ladies.
That's gross.

51:44.271 --> 51:46.373
Hey, you do realize
if you get your wish,

51:46.440 --> 51:47.942
someone's gonna
have to pay the 10 ladies

51:48.009 --> 51:49.443
- to get naked for you, right?
- Mm-hmm.

51:52.279 --> 51:53.313
Okay, I never thought
about that. Wow.

51:53.380 --> 51:55.182
-No, you didn't.
-Shit.

51:57.085 --> 51:58.753
What would you
wish for, McVries?

52:00.120 --> 52:01.823
I had a wish for a long time,

52:01.889 --> 52:03.256
for years, actually, but...

52:04.525 --> 52:07.361
I've changed my wish
in the last couple days.

52:07.427 --> 52:11.465
From now on, I'm gonna wish
that Long Walk has two winners.

52:11.532 --> 52:14.736
'Cause then...
then in years to come,

52:14.802 --> 52:18.039
people can have hope
that maybe their friends
just might make it.

52:18.106 --> 52:20.307
Ah, they'll
never allow that shit.

52:20.374 --> 52:23.044
Well, hell if I don't try.

52:23.111 --> 52:25.245
-That's beautiful, Pete.
-Oh, fuck off, man.

52:25.312 --> 52:27.715
No, I'm not fucking with you.
I'm dead serious.

52:27.782 --> 52:29.651
That's really
fucking goddamn beautiful.

52:29.717 --> 52:32.185
I still think
10 naked ladies
is a fucking no-brainer.

52:32.252 --> 52:35.188
- Oh, Jesus.
- How about you, Garraty?

52:35.255 --> 52:36.490
Uh, no, I'm not saying.

52:36.557 --> 52:37.959
It's like a birthday wish,
you know?

52:38.026 --> 52:38.960
- Oh, come on, man.
- I'm not trying to jinx it.

52:39.027 --> 52:41.062
Come on. Come on, Garraty.
Come on.

52:41.129 --> 52:42.830
The chances it's gonna be you,

52:42.897 --> 52:45.165
or any one of us
for that matter,

52:45.232 --> 52:47.267
is slim to none.
What's the harm?

52:47.334 --> 52:49.369
Chances are getting
better and better.

52:49.436 --> 52:50.505
And, you know,

52:50.571 --> 52:52.205
I'm feeling
pretty good today, so...

52:52.272 --> 52:53.941
Ooh!

52:54.008 --> 52:56.443
-Look at you.
-There you go.

52:56.511 --> 52:58.178
But, uh, I don't know.
How many of us are left?

52:58.245 --> 53:00.048
Well, one, two, three,
four, five, six.

53:00.114 --> 53:03.183
There's around 15, probably.
I don't know.

53:03.250 --> 53:04.786
Those are no longer bad odds.

53:07.588 --> 53:10.290
This ain't enjoyable
at all anymore.

53:10.357 --> 53:12.225
There's no fucking flavor.

53:12.292 --> 53:13.561
Talking about the piece of gum?

53:13.628 --> 53:15.563
-Oh, God. Spit it out, man.
-That's so gross.

53:15.630 --> 53:16.864
Oh, what can I say?

53:16.931 --> 53:18.700
I'm a superstitious
motherfucker.

53:19.834 --> 53:22.970
I got this feeling
in the depth of my gut.

53:23.037 --> 53:25.640
As long as this gum lasts,
so do I.

53:25.707 --> 53:27.709
When she goes, I go.

53:27.775 --> 53:30.144
We gotta make it
through this thing together,
me and the gum.

53:30.210 --> 53:32.245
That's as beautiful
as it is disgusting, Olson.

53:32.312 --> 53:33.413
No, no, no. Don't change

53:33.480 --> 53:35.149
-the subject now, Garraty.
-No, I'm not.

53:35.215 --> 53:36.951
You ain't here
for the money, right?

53:37.018 --> 53:38.418
Give us a nibble.
What you here for?

53:39.554 --> 53:41.055
Listen, I'll tell you this.

53:41.122 --> 53:43.124
I want my wish to change things.

53:43.191 --> 53:45.126
You know? Maybe stop
this whole thing altogether.

53:45.193 --> 53:46.426
"You can't wish for things

53:46.493 --> 53:48.428
"that cause changes in a state's

53:48.495 --> 53:49.731
- "policies and procedures."
- Oh, my God, Olson.

53:49.797 --> 53:50.998
-No, that's not what...
-That's rule number...

53:51.065 --> 53:52.299
...I'm talking about, my man.
I'm just saying,

53:52.365 --> 53:53.768
I'm not wishing
for something to change.

53:53.835 --> 53:57.105
My wish, if I get it,
might enact change.

53:57.171 --> 53:59.306
-You know, indirectly.
-Fuck are you hiding, Garraty?

53:59.372 --> 54:01.341
Ain't these supposed to be
your best fucking friends?

54:01.408 --> 54:04.277
Hey, shut the fuck up,
killer, huh?

54:04.344 --> 54:05.780
Go find your own circle, man.

54:05.847 --> 54:07.081
Hey, gotta be careful

54:07.148 --> 54:09.416
saying that kinda stuff
out loud, man.

54:09.483 --> 54:10.752
The Major have you shot

54:10.818 --> 54:12.319
for talking
about ideas like that.

54:12.385 --> 54:13.755
No, I know.

54:13.821 --> 54:14.856
Just, um...

54:17.024 --> 54:18.760
I don't know. I figure,
within the next two days,

54:18.826 --> 54:21.796
I'm either gonna be
dead or the winner.

54:21.863 --> 54:23.698
Might as well speak while I can.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.168
Hey, he's right.

54:27.235 --> 54:28.736
You know, you right, Garraty.

54:30.037 --> 54:32.507
-Fuck the Long Walk.
-There you go, Pete.

54:32.573 --> 54:35.843
-Hey, fuck the Major!
-There you go.

54:35.910 --> 54:37.512
- Fuck the Long Walk!
- Fuck the Long Walk!

54:37.578 --> 54:39.680
- Hell, yeah, Collie!
- Fuck the Major!

54:39.747 --> 54:41.381
-Come on, Baker, what you got?
-Fuck the Long Walk!

54:41.448 --> 54:42.683
What you got, boy?

54:42.750 --> 54:44.018
-Screw the Walk, man.
-Fuck the Walk.

54:44.085 --> 54:45.520
-Screw the Walk.
-Yeah, screw the Walk.

54:45.586 --> 54:47.789
-Guys, guys, come on!
-There you go, baby!

54:47.855 --> 54:50.558
Oh, come on.
Olson, don't be
a fucking pussy now.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.325
The Major isn't a smart target.

54:52.392 --> 54:53.795
Fuck the Major!
Fuck the Long Walk!

54:53.861 --> 54:54.962
Oh, shit, Stebbins.

54:55.029 --> 54:56.831
Well, he gon' have
to fuckin' shoot me.

54:56.898 --> 54:58.199
Is that what he gonna do?

54:58.266 --> 55:00.067
- Fuck the Long Walk!
- Yeah. Fuck the Walk.

55:00.134 --> 55:01.869
Fuck the Major and fuck
those fucking soldiers!

55:01.936 --> 55:03.204
There you go.

55:03.271 --> 55:04.572
- Fuck you, man!
- Yeah! Fuck the Long Walk!

55:04.639 --> 55:06.040
Fuck the Long Walk!

55:06.107 --> 55:07.474
- Yes.
- Fuck the Long Walk!

55:07.542 --> 55:10.144
-Fuck the Walk!
-Yeah! Fuck the Long Walk!

55:12.379 --> 55:13.480
Fuck the Long Walk!

55:13.548 --> 55:14.916
-Fuck the Walk!
-Fuck the Walk!

55:14.982 --> 55:17.084
- Fuck the Walk!
- Fuck yeah! Yeah!

55:17.151 --> 55:18.351
Fuck the Major!

55:19.921 --> 55:21.222
-Fuck the Long Walk!
-There he is!

55:21.289 --> 55:22.857
-Fuck the Long Walk!
-Yeah, fuck the Long Walk!

55:22.924 --> 55:24.491
Major, look! Fuck you!

55:46.814 --> 55:50.017
Oh, Pete.

55:51.418 --> 55:53.187
You...
you wanna get some sleep?

55:53.254 --> 55:54.288
You want me to...

55:56.157 --> 55:57.191
Nah.

55:58.192 --> 55:59.627
That's all you.

56:01.262 --> 56:02.296
Thanks, Pete.

56:25.219 --> 56:27.088
All right,
stay right there, Pete.

56:30.423 --> 56:31.826
Ah, fuck me.

56:31.893 --> 56:33.493
All right, don't drop it,
all right?

56:33.561 --> 56:34.795
- We playing ball?
- Ready?

56:34.862 --> 56:36.030
- Hit me.
- All right.

56:36.631 --> 56:37.899
There you go.

56:37.965 --> 56:39.834
<i>- Warning, number six.</i>
- Nice. There you go.

56:39.901 --> 56:41.434
- Whoa.
- Whoa, Art. Whoa!

56:41.501 --> 56:43.104
- Easy, Art. Damn.
- Jesus.

56:43.170 --> 56:45.139
Don't take long now.

56:45.206 --> 56:46.874
- Come on.
- You gotta go.

56:47.975 --> 56:49.744
- Is he good?
<i>- Second warning,</i>

56:49.810 --> 56:51.012
-No, he's not up yet.
<i>-...number six.</i>

56:51.078 --> 56:52.113
Get up, Art.

56:52.179 --> 56:54.248
Fucking nasty.

56:54.315 --> 56:56.183
Pinch it off, my man.

56:56.250 --> 56:58.753
Ain't so easy with a...
gun on my...

57:02.422 --> 57:03.624
What, you need a gun
to your head

57:03.691 --> 57:05.293
to get up from a shit? Jesus.

57:05.359 --> 57:06.594
Goddamn!

57:08.195 --> 57:09.764
Fastest crap I ever took.

57:09.830 --> 57:12.033
You should have brought an issue
of <i>The New Yorker</i> with you.

57:13.901 --> 57:15.536
Never could go long
without a crap.

57:16.537 --> 57:19.340
See, most guys, they...

57:19.407 --> 57:21.876
they crap once a week.

57:21.943 --> 57:24.444
Me? I'm a once-a-day
type of guy, you know?

57:24.512 --> 57:26.314
If I don't crap once a day, I...

57:26.380 --> 57:28.416
I take a laxative.

57:28.481 --> 57:31.786
There are three great truths
in the world.

57:33.287 --> 57:34.855
A good meal,

57:34.922 --> 57:36.557
a good screw,

57:36.624 --> 57:37.892
and a good shit.

57:39.026 --> 57:40.161
And that's all.

57:41.862 --> 57:43.496
Olson's a smart man.

57:43.564 --> 57:44.665
You keep saying "crap," though.

57:44.732 --> 57:45.766
What's up with that?

57:47.268 --> 57:48.803
It's always sounded
a little less vulgar to me

57:48.869 --> 57:51.072
than the... than the S-word.

57:51.138 --> 57:54.342
Well, I ain't never heard
of the Bible forbidding
the word "shit."

57:54.408 --> 57:55.676
How about you, Ray?

57:55.743 --> 57:57.378
Not me.

57:57.445 --> 57:59.647
Yeah, well, it's not...
it's not that it's a rule
or anything.

57:59.714 --> 58:01.481
It's just, you know...

58:01.549 --> 58:03.250
the idea is the Bible...

58:03.317 --> 58:04.352
-...the Bible says...
-Can you... Can you...

58:04.418 --> 58:06.821
Sorry, can you break off?

58:06.887 --> 58:08.856
You stink.

58:11.125 --> 58:13.493
Listen, it's not your fault.
You didn't have time to wipe.

58:13.561 --> 58:15.863
But we shouldn't all be
fucking paying for it.

58:15.930 --> 58:17.765
You know what I mean?

58:17.832 --> 58:19.266
-Sorry, Art.
-I love you. I love you.

58:19.333 --> 58:20.434
-Yeah, we love you, Art.
-Thank you.

58:20.500 --> 58:22.903
Just keep it...
you know, just, like...

58:22.970 --> 58:25.373
Just run, like, two miles
up the road. Okay?

58:27.274 --> 58:29.510
-Ugh.
-Well, Ray, we're alone.

58:31.579 --> 58:32.613
How 'bout it?

58:36.417 --> 58:38.352
It's just gotta stay
between us, Pete.

58:39.854 --> 58:42.556
You have my word, <i>compadre,</i>
and that means something.

58:46.093 --> 58:48.529
Um...

58:50.131 --> 58:52.500
My dad, uh, you know...

58:57.304 --> 58:59.040
My dad was my hero.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.576
And, um...

59:02.643 --> 59:05.479
you know, he always
wanted to show me things

59:05.546 --> 59:08.416
that honestly could have
gotten him jailed.

59:08.482 --> 59:10.217
You know, he wanted
to show me books by,

59:10.284 --> 59:12.420
you know,
Nietzsche and Kierkegaard,

59:12.486 --> 59:14.722
Mark Twain and Camus,
and show me music,

59:14.789 --> 59:16.557
real fucking uninhibited music.

59:16.624 --> 59:17.858
-Yeah.
-And just...

59:17.925 --> 59:19.226
you know,
that was the kinda guy he was.

59:19.293 --> 59:20.761
He was uninhibited,

59:20.828 --> 59:21.929
and just, uh...

59:23.631 --> 59:25.266
you know, I don't know.
I wanted to know the old way,

59:25.332 --> 59:26.734
so he showed it to me.

59:26.801 --> 59:28.335
And all that shit's illegal now.

59:28.402 --> 59:30.271
Yeah, I think he thought
he had a system.

59:30.337 --> 59:31.540
He thought he was being
careful, but...

Dad, do you mind

59:47.421 --> 59:48.923
grabbing the baseball?

59:48.989 --> 59:51.025
It's right next
to the sewing machine.

59:51.092 --> 59:53.027
It's right... Thank you.

59:53.094 --> 59:54.595
Thanks.

59:57.665 --> 59:58.666
Mmm.

01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:03.337
-Dad? Dad?
-William, what did you do?

01:00:03.404 --> 01:00:04.605
What did you do?

01:00:04.672 --> 01:00:06.508
- Dad?
- What's happening?

01:00:06.575 --> 01:00:08.342
William?

01:00:08.409 --> 01:00:10.611
William,
what's happening?

01:00:10.678 --> 01:00:12.680
He says things he doesn't mean!

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.949
He says things he doesn't mean!

01:00:15.015 --> 01:00:17.051
Mr. William Garraty,

01:00:17.118 --> 01:00:19.019
you've been accused
and convicted,

01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:21.222
for high crimes
of possession and teaching,

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:24.024
of banned materials and ideas.

01:00:24.091 --> 01:00:25.860
Do you pledge allegiance
to the state,

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:27.728
-the system, and the squads...
-Please.

01:00:27.795 --> 01:00:29.497
...here and now
on the street

01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:30.731
before your family,

01:00:30.798 --> 01:00:33.501
or immediate deactivation?

01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:38.205
There's still time
to be an example for your son.

01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:41.610
Still time for you
to make the honorable choice.

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:45.913
It's your decision.

01:00:50.585 --> 01:00:51.685
No, sir.

01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:52.920
Oh, my God.

01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:55.557
I will pledge
no such allegiance.

01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:57.191
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:00:57.258 --> 01:00:59.827
- Luck to you, Mr. Garraty.
- No!

01:00:59.894 --> 01:01:01.362
- May God show mercy.
- No!

01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:02.863
Never forget who you are, Ray.

01:01:05.065 --> 01:01:06.100
God.

01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:09.970
I'm so sorry.

01:01:11.238 --> 01:01:12.740
It's all right. I'm all right.

01:01:12.806 --> 01:01:14.975
No, Ray, it's not all right.

01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:21.215
Yeah, you're right, it's not.

01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:23.317
And that's why
I'm gonna kill him.

01:01:26.086 --> 01:01:28.923
- No.
- Yep.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:31.025
How? Ray, you can't
wish him dead.

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:32.326
-I have a wish.
-A wish that will give me

01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:34.128
the ability to do it
once I'm the winner.

01:01:34.195 --> 01:01:35.863
Once I'm close enough to him.

01:01:36.864 --> 01:01:37.898
What?

01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:43.871
I'm gonna wish
for the carbine.

01:01:43.938 --> 01:01:45.005
The gun?

01:01:46.774 --> 01:01:47.875
And they'd have
to give it to you.

01:01:47.942 --> 01:01:49.578
Yeah, and that's how I'd do it.

01:01:49.644 --> 01:01:50.811
Right fucking there.

01:01:52.179 --> 01:01:53.582
But you gotta win first.

01:01:53.648 --> 01:01:54.715
Yeah, but, Pete,
I'll tell you this,

01:01:54.782 --> 01:01:55.816
nobody wants it more than me.

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.184
Nobody here wants it
more than I do.

01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:58.587
Yeah, I'm not arguing
with that, <i>compadre,</i> but...

01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:00.721
Listen, my dad was
the last true good person

01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:03.224
on this planet.
I swear to fucking God.

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.959
And he was willing
to risk everything

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:06.160
in order to show me
the old ways.

01:02:06.227 --> 01:02:07.928
This is my chance to do my part,

01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:09.797
change things
the way he wanted to.

01:02:09.863 --> 01:02:10.998
-Yeah, but, Ray...
-Pete, my chance...

01:02:11.065 --> 01:02:12.567
to cut off the fuckin' head
of the dragon.

01:02:12.634 --> 01:02:14.268
Ray...

01:02:14.335 --> 01:02:16.571
he chose to leave you.

01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:17.838
How's that good?

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:21.976
Garraty, do you have any idea

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:24.178
how hard it is
to fucking kill a man?

01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:25.946
I've killed a deer,
and that's hard enough.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:28.015
Like, killing a man is only easy

01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:30.251
for a certain kind of person.

01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:31.418
I'll become that kinda person.

01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:32.953
That'd be fucking sad.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.488
Those kinda people
can't see the beauty

01:02:34.556 --> 01:02:35.956
-in this world.
-What fucking beauty?

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:38.125
The sky, the trees, the birds.

01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:39.594
Fuck, man, everything.

01:02:40.595 --> 01:02:41.996
Do you know
what else is beautiful?

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.864
Us.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:46.267
'Cause we're real friends,
aren't we?

01:02:47.669 --> 01:02:49.638
Pete, what does it matter?

01:02:49.704 --> 01:02:52.139
Whether we have three hours,
three days, or three decades,

01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:54.808
this moment,
this fucking moment,

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.143
it matters, man.

01:02:56.844 --> 01:02:58.580
Say it.

01:02:58.647 --> 01:03:00.314
This matters.
This moment matters.

01:03:00.381 --> 01:03:02.916
Yeah. Goddamn right, Musketeer.

01:03:05.853 --> 01:03:07.154
But it doesn't really matter,
does it, Pete?

01:03:07.221 --> 01:03:09.223
Because when this moment's over,

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.358
I'm still gonna
fucking kill him.

01:03:11.425 --> 01:03:13.528
Fair enough.

01:03:13.595 --> 01:03:15.796
But realize,
even if you pull it off,

01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:18.165
-they'll fucking kill you.
-You don't know that shit.

01:03:18.232 --> 01:03:20.267
I'll be the winner.
That's uncharted territory.

01:03:21.636 --> 01:03:22.803
What about your mom?

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.071
Don't fucking bring up
my mom, Pete.

01:03:24.138 --> 01:03:25.740
What about your mom?

01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:27.542
-Does she know?
-No, she doesn't.

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:29.109
This thing's bigger
than me and my mom.

01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:37.851
Pete, look at that bunch
of fucking pigs.

01:03:37.918 --> 01:03:39.253
They wanna see
our fucking brains

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.488
on the concrete, man.
They'd just as soon see yours.

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.792
All how you fucking see it.

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.160
Look harder.

01:03:46.226 --> 01:03:48.929
You see that? That's a family,
and they love each other.

01:03:49.631 --> 01:03:50.898
We can't get mad at them

01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:52.066
for being conditioned
to think that this is okay

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:54.536
when... when we're
the fuckin' same.

01:03:58.238 --> 01:03:59.873
You know what, Ray?

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.509
Your wish means nothing

01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:03.377
if you don't believe
in that family over there.

01:04:04.612 --> 01:04:05.780
If you don't believe
they're worth being saved,

01:04:05.846 --> 01:04:07.047
you may as well
sit down right now,

01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:09.116
and let them riddle you
with bullets, because...

01:04:09.983 --> 01:04:11.218
vengeance, Ray...

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:14.321
vengeance is not enough.

01:04:21.629 --> 01:04:22.797
See that?

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:29.002
That's something
to be grateful for.

01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:36.477
You ever had a brother, Ray?

01:04:37.945 --> 01:04:39.246
No.

01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:40.347
Neither have I.

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:45.486
You wanna walk with me a while?

01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:47.822
Yeah.

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:48.989
Yeah, I do, Pete.

01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:54.562
<i>Warning, number 47.</i>

01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:57.030

My feet. Please, help.

01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:30.565
Please.

Who the fuck is that?

01:05:56.858 --> 01:06:00.093
It's Tressler.
He's the kid with the radio.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.564
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Third warning, 24.</i>

01:06:22.049 --> 01:06:23.050

-Fuck.

01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:24.586
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:25.920
I wanna go home.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:07.494
Garraty.

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:11.699
You tired, Garraty?

01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:15.402
Am I tired?

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:17.705
Ye...
Yeah, I'm a little tired.

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:18.973
Exhausted?

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.475
I'm getting there.

01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:24.311
No.

01:07:25.178 --> 01:07:26.614
You're not exhausted.

01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:29.651
Not yet.

01:07:29.717 --> 01:07:31.586
I don't know why I bother
talkin' to you, man.

01:07:31.653 --> 01:07:34.522
It's like talking
to fucking smoke.

01:07:35.322 --> 01:07:37.525
Olson's exhausted.

01:07:37.592 --> 01:07:39.326
He's almost through now.

01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:42.630
You got balls talkin'
about Olson,

01:07:42.697 --> 01:07:44.032
looking the way you look.

01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:47.167
Shit himself.

01:07:47.234 --> 01:07:48.836
You smell that?

01:07:48.903 --> 01:07:49.938
Even I can.

01:07:50.004 --> 01:07:51.606
The fuck are you
driving at, man?

01:07:51.673 --> 01:07:54.308
Why don't you ask
your hick friend, Art Baker?

01:07:54.374 --> 01:07:55.643
The mule doesn't like to plow,

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.344
but it sure does like
the tasty carrots.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.715
Watch Olson.

01:08:00.782 --> 01:08:02.050
He doesn't quite know it yet,

01:08:02.115 --> 01:08:04.519
but he's lost his appetite
for the carrot.

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:07.254
Olson?

01:08:08.188 --> 01:08:09.222
Hank?

01:08:10.692 --> 01:08:11.859
Olson?

01:08:11.926 --> 01:08:13.260
Olson, talk to me, man.
What's goin' on?

01:08:13.327 --> 01:08:14.428
Hey, hey.

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.296
Talk to me, Hank.

01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:18.332
Stebbins is talking
about carrots and donkeys.

01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:20.635
I don't know
what's happening, but...

01:08:20.702 --> 01:08:21.736
You okay?

01:08:23.337 --> 01:08:24.371
You all right?

01:08:24.438 --> 01:08:25.707
Talk to me.

01:08:27.508 --> 01:08:29.577
God's garden.

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:36.216
It's full of weeds.

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:39.854
- Hank. Hank!
<i>- Warning, 46.</i>

01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:41.022
- Hey.
- Hey, keep walking,

01:08:41.089 --> 01:08:42.155
-Hank!
-Hey, Hank!

01:08:42.222 --> 01:08:43.223
Olson, come on.
Just keep walking.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.491
Keep walking,
man, come on!

01:08:44.559 --> 01:08:45.727
-Olson, get that fucker!
-Please!

01:08:48.062 --> 01:08:49.897
Come on. No!

01:08:51.264 --> 01:08:53.067
No, no, no.

01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:55.937
<i>- Second warning, 46.</i>
- Art!

01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:01.375
Hank! Hank!

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:02.543
<i>- Warning, number six.</i>

01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:04.344
-Art! Get back here, Art!
-Art, get fucking

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:06.146
- back here now!
- Art, he's dead.

01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:07.815
Why the hell
don't they just finish him?

01:09:07.882 --> 01:09:09.216
- They gut-shot him.
- Art, get back here!

01:09:09.282 --> 01:09:10.585
They're gonna let him bleed out.

01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:12.152
It's deliberate
to discourage any of us

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:14.321
from doing the old
Charge-of-the-Light-Brigade
number.

01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:16.557
Hank. Hank. Hank, buddy.

01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:19.727
- Buddy, buddy. No, no, no.
<i>- Second warning, six.</i>

01:09:19.794 --> 01:09:21.062
Why...

01:09:21.129 --> 01:09:22.162
Hey, come on. Why'd you do this?

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:23.430
<i>Warning, 47.</i>

01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:25.332
Ray! Ray!

- Art...
- Why'd you do this?

01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:29.336
- I did it wrong.
- Art, get the fuck up!

01:09:29.403 --> 01:09:30.505
I did it all wrong.

01:09:30.571 --> 01:09:32.372
- Why?
- I did it all wrong.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:33.508
No, I'm here.
I'm here, buddy.

01:09:33.574 --> 01:09:34.676
He's dead.
Art, I need you...

01:09:34.742 --> 01:09:35.777
I need you
to get the fuck up right now!

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:36.944
Shoot me! Hank, no, you can't!

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:38.178
Come on. He's dead. He's dead!

01:09:38.245 --> 01:09:39.514
No, no!

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:40.682
I'm sorry, Olson.

01:09:43.151 --> 01:09:44.852
I did it wrong!

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:46.120
-What?
-I'm sorry!

01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:47.454
-He was dead! He's dead!
-I did it wrong!

01:09:47.522 --> 01:09:49.389
What? I'm gonna lose you too?

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:54.629
I did it all wrong!

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:56.964
Garraty, I couldn't
save him, man.

01:09:57.031 --> 01:09:58.099
I know, I know, I know.

01:09:58.166 --> 01:09:59.399
-I couldn't save him, Garraty!
-I know.

01:09:59.466 --> 01:10:02.369
- Art! I did it wrong!
- I know, I know.

01:10:02.436 --> 01:10:03.538
I'm sorry.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.108
-Couldn't save...
-I know.

01:10:07.175 --> 01:10:08.810
-Couldn't save him!
-Stop.

01:10:08.876 --> 01:10:10.011
Stop, it's okay.

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.616
You did a good thing.

01:10:15.683 --> 01:10:17.484
-No, man.
-You did a good thing.

01:10:21.055 --> 01:10:23.323
- He called my name.
- I know. Stop.

01:10:24.025 --> 01:10:25.126
He needed me.

01:10:25.193 --> 01:10:26.359
I know, I know.

01:11:03.664 --> 01:11:06.868
I wish he would've shot
one of those fuckers.

01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:09.036
Still can't get over
the pure fucking
idiocy of Olson.

01:11:09.103 --> 01:11:11.239
Why don't you keep his name
out your fucking mouth?

01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:13.440
He didn't go out quietly,

01:11:13.508 --> 01:11:15.408
and I respect
the hell out of him for that.

01:11:17.745 --> 01:11:19.881
-I respect it, as well.
-So, what of it?

01:11:21.115 --> 01:11:22.282
He was married.

01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:25.052
Oh, that's...
that's a load of bullshit.

01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:26.319
It's the truth.

01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:29.724
Told a few of us
at the drop off.

01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:31.559
Got a lot of
ball-busting for it.

01:11:32.593 --> 01:11:33.594
He's the only one.

01:11:34.862 --> 01:11:36.496
The only one
with a fucking wife.

01:11:37.765 --> 01:11:39.167
Get this.

01:11:39.233 --> 01:11:40.735
Her name's Clementine.

01:11:40.802 --> 01:11:41.903
Like the song.

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:43.971
Okay, fellas,

01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:45.940
let's make a promise right now,

01:11:47.241 --> 01:11:49.644
whoever wins has to do
something for his wife.

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.812
How about that?

01:11:50.878 --> 01:11:53.014
That's exactly
fucking right, Pete.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.081
Do what? I'm not the fuckwad

01:11:54.148 --> 01:11:55.348
who decided
to widow a, you know...

01:11:55.415 --> 01:11:57.585
Listen, just money or something,

01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:00.154
just to make sure
she's okay, all right?

01:12:01.388 --> 01:12:02.523
Sounds like some bleeding-heart

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:04.324
-bullshit to me.
-Fucking, come on, Parker.

01:12:04.391 --> 01:12:05.560
Come on.

01:12:05.626 --> 01:12:07.261
I know you got
a heart in there somewhere.

01:12:10.798 --> 01:12:12.967
Fucking say I never did
anything for you, McVries.

01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:15.303
My man.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.138
And what about you, Baker?

01:12:17.205 --> 01:12:19.273
<i>- Warning, number 23.</i>
- Yeah?

01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:21.075
Yeah.

01:12:21.142 --> 01:12:22.510
Come on. Yeah.

01:12:23.678 --> 01:12:25.146
What about you, Stebbins?

01:12:26.614 --> 01:12:27.648
Why not?

01:12:28.448 --> 01:12:30.952
Go team.

01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:32.720
You feeling okay?

01:12:32.787 --> 01:12:34.121
No, I'm not feeling okay.

01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:36.157
It's a hell of a thing.

01:12:37.592 --> 01:12:39.827
I haven't been sick in 10 years,

01:12:39.894 --> 01:12:41.028
and my body decides to do it

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:42.462
during this exact
stretch of days.

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.131
Like some cruel fucking joke.

01:12:44.198 --> 01:12:45.600
It's called irony.

01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:48.236
Yeah,
I know what irony is.

01:12:48.903 --> 01:12:50.638
Won't stop me, though.

01:12:50.705 --> 01:12:52.372
Still fucking winning this shit.

01:12:52.439 --> 01:12:54.976
Fuck! Mmm.

01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:00.480
Hey, um.

01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:03.751
Why didn't your buddy ask me

01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:06.386
if I wanted to help
Hank's girl out, you know?

01:13:07.188 --> 01:13:08.656
I mean, um,

01:13:08.723 --> 01:13:10.725
you know, I wanted to be asked.

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:11.792
You didn't hear me say

01:13:11.859 --> 01:13:12.994
I didn't wanna
be asked, did you?

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.562
No, I... I didn't hear
you say that. No.

01:13:17.632 --> 01:13:19.567
Shit, man.

01:13:19.634 --> 01:13:22.402
I think I just got off
on the wrong foot
with you boys, you know?

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:25.006
Like, I'm a good enough guy
if you get to know me.

01:13:25.072 --> 01:13:26.173
I just...

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.608
I don't really have
a crowd, you know?

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:29.110
I never had a crowd in school,

01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:30.511
I guess,
is what I'm trying to say.

01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:32.313
You know, I was always
getting off on the wrong foot,

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.981
-but, um...
-Okay.

01:13:34.048 --> 01:13:35.850
Fuck, man. I mean...

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:39.020
guy's gotta have
a couple buddies
on... on a fucked-up thing

01:13:39.086 --> 01:13:40.888
- like this, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:42.857
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:45.359
Listen, man, um...

01:13:47.395 --> 01:13:48.629
that Rank kid.

01:13:48.696 --> 01:13:49.730
-Yeah.
-Man.

01:13:51.065 --> 01:13:54.335
I... I didn't wanna
see him go, you know?

01:13:54.402 --> 01:13:57.437
I... I... I would never,
you know...

01:13:57.505 --> 01:13:58.773
Fuck, man, I just...

01:13:59.874 --> 01:14:02.510
I can't stop fucking
hearing it and seeing it

01:14:02.576 --> 01:14:03.978
in my mind
over and over again, man.

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:06.314
I can't fucking do it
anymore, man. I just gotta...

01:14:07.381 --> 01:14:09.016
I'm just...
I'm fucking sorry, man,

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.284
-and I...
-Yeah.

01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:11.686
I can't think
it's my fucking fault, right?

01:14:11.752 --> 01:14:12.820
-Yeah.
-It's not my fault, right?

01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:14.355
It's not. It's not.

01:14:14.422 --> 01:14:15.690
-Okay.
-It's not. Okay?

01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:17.191
So... so what...
what do you want, Gary?

01:14:17.258 --> 01:14:18.993
You wanna be a... you wanna be

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.328
-a part of the deal?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:14:20.394 --> 01:14:21.395
-that's what I was saying.
-Okay. Okay.

01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:22.863
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:25.032
I'll tell that,
I'll tell that bitch,

01:14:25.099 --> 01:14:26.667
she can have enough bread
to stay on Fifth Avenue

01:14:26.734 --> 01:14:28.903
-the rest of her fucking life.
-Okay, man.

01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:32.406
And if you don't mind
telling your buddy,

01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:33.574
just that I'm a part of it now.

01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:35.242
-I can tell Pete, yeah.
-Thanks, man.

01:14:35.309 --> 01:14:36.377
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:38.145
Oh, shit, man.

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:40.581
Guy's gotta have
a couple buddies, man.

01:14:40.648 --> 01:14:41.916
That's what my daddy
always used to say.

01:14:41.983 --> 01:14:43.584
Fuck! Fuck!

01:14:43.651 --> 01:14:45.886
Oh, shit, man. I'm sorry, man.

01:14:45.953 --> 01:14:48.189
-I just... I don't wanna go...
-It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

01:14:48.255 --> 01:14:50.490
And I don't wanna die
hated, you know?

01:14:50.558 --> 01:14:51.726
You gotta die.

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:53.227
And that's the fucked-up thing
about all this

01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:55.596
is that we all gotta go,
you know?

01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:57.898
It just doesn't have
to be like this

01:14:57.965 --> 01:14:59.000
right now, you know?

01:14:59.066 --> 01:15:00.067
Doesn't have to be
like this, but...

01:15:00.134 --> 01:15:03.204
-Yeah.
-Fuck! Fuck, man.

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:04.872
-Hey.
-Can't fucking stop it, man.

01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:05.973
Hey, you okay?

01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:08.075
The fuck did you just say?

01:15:08.142 --> 01:15:09.410
The fuck did you just say, man?

01:15:09.477 --> 01:15:10.678
Asking if you're
fucking good.

01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:11.612
I didn't fucking mean
to kill that kid, man!

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.080
I didn't fucking mean it, okay?

01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:14.749
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm fucking sorry, man.

01:15:14.815 --> 01:15:16.117
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:18.386
Hey, Gary. Come on, man.
It's all right.

01:15:18.452 --> 01:15:19.553
We're all right.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.955
We're all just friends
right now, man.

01:15:21.022 --> 01:15:22.123
We're all just walking together

01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:23.691
-as friends, okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:26.293
You got us. You got us.
You got your pack.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.529
All right? Come on.

01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:30.131
There you go. Just like that.

01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:31.399
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:33.734
- So, we're gonna keep walkin'.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:33.801 --> 01:15:35.202
I'm gonna go tell Pete that...

01:15:36.837 --> 01:15:38.105
I'm gonna go tell Pete
you wanna be part

01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:40.074
-of the plan, all right?
-Thanks, man.

01:15:40.141 --> 01:15:41.175
All right.

01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:43.377
All right.

01:15:43.444 --> 01:15:44.879
All right. Keep walking, please.

01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:45.980
Okay.

01:15:47.448 --> 01:15:48.883
Fuck, is he okay?

01:15:48.949 --> 01:15:50.317
He said he wants
to be a part of it.

01:15:51.786 --> 01:15:53.320
No, no, no.

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.423
No, no, no.

01:15:55.489 --> 01:15:58.426
Oh, fuck, man. I gotta go, man.

01:15:58.492 --> 01:16:00.394
-Gotta fucking go, man.
-Hey, Barkovitch. Barkovitch.

01:16:00.461 --> 01:16:01.462
-Gary.
-Hey!

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:02.963
It's all right, Gary.
Just keep...

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:05.733
- Fuck, man.
- Hey, Barkovitch.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.268
Hey. Barkovitch.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:09.070
Ah, Pete, just let him walk.
Come on.

01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:13.674
- Keep walking, Gary.

Oh, God.

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:25.953
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Why'd he do that?

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.822
Why the fuck
did he do that? Fuck!

-What?
-To your mom?

01:18:21.035 --> 01:18:23.871
Oh, yeah, it shouldn't be...
it shouldn't be long now.

01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:29.343
You're one lucky
son of a bitch, Garraty.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.381
Get to see your mom.

01:18:37.985 --> 01:18:40.354
Who the hell am I gonna see
between now and the end, huh?

01:18:41.789 --> 01:18:44.024
No one but the fucking pigs
who come and stare.

01:18:47.662 --> 01:18:49.463
I'm homesick,

01:18:49.531 --> 01:18:51.566
and I'm fucking scared.

01:18:51.633 --> 01:18:54.969
Hey, I'm scared, too, Collie.

01:18:55.035 --> 01:18:58.005
If it makes you feel
any better
I think we're all homesick.

01:18:59.373 --> 01:19:00.407
You know?

01:19:01.442 --> 01:19:03.077
Fucking easy for you to talk.

01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:05.913
This is your home state.

01:19:07.181 --> 01:19:08.482
You're the only one
who gets to see family.

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:10.451
I don't know.

01:19:10.518 --> 01:19:12.920
I think maybe
it might make it worse.

01:19:12.987 --> 01:19:14.922
The fuck are you butting in for?

01:19:17.358 --> 01:19:19.628
I think he's got it harder
than either of us.

01:19:20.562 --> 01:19:22.296
I think it might throw him off.

01:19:25.332 --> 01:19:26.701
Oh, fuck off.

01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:29.036
You're both crazy.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.209
You really think
it's gonna be harder?

01:19:39.847 --> 01:19:42.850
I just want you
to keep on walking.

01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:03.904
We made it to Freeport, Pete.

01:20:05.707 --> 01:20:08.942
Mile 286.

01:20:09.943 --> 01:20:11.579
We live to fight another day.

01:20:14.214 --> 01:20:15.382
Fuck!

01:20:15.449 --> 01:20:16.817
Damn bottom of my shoe fell off.

01:20:16.884 --> 01:20:19.853
Gotta get rid
of them both, Garraty.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.791
Or else some nails
will start poking through.

01:20:22.856 --> 01:20:25.292
Plus, you work harder
when you're off balance.

01:20:26.927 --> 01:20:28.763
<i>Warning, number 47.</i>

01:20:50.117 --> 01:20:51.885

01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:04.031

-how sorry I am.
-It's okay.

01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.540
Mom, please...
I just wanna hug. Please.

01:21:12.607 --> 01:21:13.708
You're going to get
yourself killed. Ray, come on!

01:21:13.775 --> 01:21:14.576

I know I fucked up.

01:21:21.115 --> 01:21:22.383
Keep walking!

01:21:22.449 --> 01:21:23.551
It's okay!

01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:25.720
It's okay!

01:21:25.787 --> 01:21:27.087
Think about you father.

01:21:27.154 --> 01:21:28.556
I don't wanna
think about it.

01:21:28.623 --> 01:21:30.157
I'm so sorry, Mom!

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:32.326
Just don't do this
in front of her.

01:21:32.393 --> 01:21:33.828
Don't do this in front of her!

01:21:33.927 --> 01:21:35.129
Fuck you!

01:21:35.195 --> 01:21:36.930
You fucking
twisted piece of shit!

01:21:36.997 --> 01:21:40.134
You were right.
I did what my dad did! I...

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.804
Pete, I have made
such a fucking
massive mistake.

01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:44.506
I should've just stayed
in the fucking car.

01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:45.607
-I should've just gone home.
-Ray.

01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:46.907
-I'm...
-Ray. Ray, you still wanna

01:21:46.974 --> 01:21:48.275
know how I got
this fucking scar, huh?

01:21:48.342 --> 01:21:49.343
-She's still there, Pete.
-Ray?

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:50.477
-Please.
-Yeah. Ray, you've been

01:21:50.545 --> 01:21:52.146
walking for five days.

01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:54.047
I've been walking
my whole fucking life.

01:21:56.885 --> 01:21:58.520
You know,

01:21:59.353 --> 01:22:01.155
my parents both died,

01:22:01.221 --> 01:22:02.857
in the big war when I was...

01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:04.291
when I was little.

01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:06.460
And, you know,
the damnedest thing...

01:22:06.528 --> 01:22:08.128
I don't remember
a single thing about 'em.

01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:13.400
A drunk uncle took me in.

01:22:14.234 --> 01:22:15.870
He beat the shit outta me,

01:22:15.936 --> 01:22:18.372
and died in a pool
of his own puke when I was 10.

01:22:19.607 --> 01:22:20.742
After that...

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:24.378
-I met kids sorta like me.
-Uh-huh.

01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:25.713
No parents.

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:27.448
Or parents
who didn't give a fuck.

01:22:30.184 --> 01:22:31.418
-Yeah?
-I lived on...

01:22:32.687 --> 01:22:35.456
couches and in basements.

01:22:35.523 --> 01:22:38.560
I slept in fields and ditches.

01:22:38.626 --> 01:22:39.861
It took years
before I was finally caught

01:22:39.928 --> 01:22:41.563
by the state.

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:43.765
But nothing was as bad
as how I was living.

01:22:45.299 --> 01:22:47.067
Picking fights,

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:48.736
stealing shit.

01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:50.204
Picking more fights.

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:52.740
Until, one day, I picked a fight
with the wrong guy.

01:22:53.908 --> 01:22:55.743
Yeah.

01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:57.545
A guy who knew his way
around a hunting knife.

01:22:59.714 --> 01:23:01.048
He cut me.

01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:03.785
He cut me fucking good.
You see this, Ray?

01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:04.985
Have a look at that.
You see that?

01:23:05.052 --> 01:23:06.386
-Jesus, Pete.
-You see it, yeah?

01:23:06.453 --> 01:23:08.890
-Yeah, I do.
-Yeah.

01:23:08.957 --> 01:23:11.225
He left me for dead.

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:13.393
I woke up in the hospital,
and you know what?

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.629
You know what, Ray?

01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:17.998
I wasn't even upset,

01:23:18.065 --> 01:23:20.000
because it wasn't his fault.
It was mine.

01:23:22.002 --> 01:23:23.270
You know,
so at that moment, I said

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:25.940
I'll always choose
to find sunlight

01:23:26.006 --> 01:23:28.710
in all this fucking darkness.

01:23:28.776 --> 01:23:30.612
'Cause what's the point
of a second chance if not?

01:23:32.514 --> 01:23:34.381
You do find the light, Pete.
You do.

01:23:34.448 --> 01:23:35.449
-I don't have that...
-Yeah.

01:23:35.517 --> 01:23:36.551
...in me, though.
I would have been

01:23:36.618 --> 01:23:37.619
fucking dead
if it wasn't for you.

01:23:37.685 --> 01:23:39.554
Ray, you think
this shit is easy?

01:23:39.621 --> 01:23:42.624
Huh? No, Ray, it's fucking hard!

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:44.893
I try fucking hard.

01:23:44.959 --> 01:23:45.994
Yeah.

01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:48.428
I don't have much to lose,

01:23:48.495 --> 01:23:50.932
but I have everything to gain,
and that's why I'm here.

01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:52.466
Yeah.

01:23:52.534 --> 01:23:55.168
I want that prize
so I can do something good.

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:58.272
Maybe help some children who...

01:23:58.338 --> 01:23:59.373
who are like me.

01:24:01.141 --> 01:24:03.243
But you know what
I could've used, Ray?

01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:04.344
What?

01:24:04.979 --> 01:24:06.014
A brother.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.118
Ray, listen to me.
If you make this,

01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:12.787
if...

01:24:12.854 --> 01:24:15.155
I suggest you choose love.

01:24:15.222 --> 01:24:17.291
I suggest you take that prize,

01:24:17.357 --> 01:24:18.560
and go home to your mom.

01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:19.994
Because, Ray, Ray,

01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:23.497
you're a good fucking kid...

01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:25.667
-Thanks, Pete. Thanks, Pete.
-...and you deserve it.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.535
Yeah.

01:24:52.026 --> 01:24:53.427
Hey, listen.

01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:55.763
I've been thinking...

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:58.032
We all got to get together
on something.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.367
What?

01:25:00.434 --> 01:25:02.135
We all gotta make an agreement

01:25:02.937 --> 01:25:04.504
that from here on out

01:25:04.572 --> 01:25:06.239
no help for anyone.

01:25:06.306 --> 01:25:08.275
You either do it on your own,
or you don't do it.

01:25:08.342 --> 01:25:10.678
The fuck's that supposed
to mean, Stebbins, huh?

01:25:10.745 --> 01:25:12.446
What the fuck's that
supposed to fucking mean, huh?

01:25:12.513 --> 01:25:14.214
No, Pete, I think
he might be right.

01:25:16.116 --> 01:25:17.819
You can't keep saving me.

01:25:21.221 --> 01:25:22.557
But what about the Musketeers?

01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:23.992
Fuck your Musketeers.

01:25:24.058 --> 01:25:26.995
It's better for all of us,
and you know it.

01:25:29.731 --> 01:25:31.532
My nose.

01:25:31.599 --> 01:25:32.967
I ain't had
a nosebleed in years.

01:25:33.034 --> 01:25:35.837
Ain't nobody give a shit
about your nosebleed, Baker.

01:25:35.903 --> 01:25:38.138
We've all got our issues,
if you couldn't tell.

01:25:38.205 --> 01:25:39.339
What'd you say?

01:25:39.406 --> 01:25:41.509
Oh, shut up. Parker?

01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:44.846
Collie Parker, are you in?

01:25:48.082 --> 01:25:49.483
Collie?

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.585
Fuck it.

01:25:52.419 --> 01:25:54.221
Goddamn motherfucker!

01:25:54.287 --> 01:25:56.156
- No!
- McVries!

01:25:56.223 --> 01:25:57.659
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.

01:25:59.226 --> 01:26:03.497
Fuck. Fuck. God.

01:26:40.968 --> 01:26:42.737
No, no. No, don't turn.

01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:44.605
Just keep walking. You okay?

01:26:44.672 --> 01:26:46.273
You okay?

01:26:46.339 --> 01:26:48.576
My nose... it's bleeding.

01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:49.677
I know.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.562
Hey. Hey, my nose.

01:27:08.295 --> 01:27:09.964
My nose won't stop.

01:27:10.031 --> 01:27:11.933
My nose won't stop bleeding.

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.602
It ain't that bad,
though, is it?

01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:15.803
- No.
- Huh?

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:17.572
-No, no. It's not that bad.
-No.

01:27:17.638 --> 01:27:19.974
It's an internal hemorrhage.
Pretty common.

01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:21.776
Stebbins, please. Come on.

01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:25.412
My grandma,

01:27:25.479 --> 01:27:28.149
- used to put ice on my nose...
- Uh-huh.

01:27:28.216 --> 01:27:30.551
every time I have a nosebleed.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.022
I wish I had
some ice to put on it.

01:27:35.089 --> 01:27:37.357
Yeah.
Let's get you some ice.

01:27:39.026 --> 01:27:40.528
Just keep walking.

01:27:43.664 --> 01:27:45.700
I'm gonna die now, boys.

01:27:45.767 --> 01:27:48.468
No. Just keep walking
a little longer, okay?

01:27:48.536 --> 01:27:51.038
No, no. I can't. I can't.

01:27:51.105 --> 01:27:52.305
Please.

01:27:52.372 --> 01:27:53.875
I can't, buddy.

01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:56.611
I'm sorry. I'm going home.

01:27:56.677 --> 01:27:58.378
-Don't apologize.
-I'm going home.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:27:59.947
-Don't apologize, Art.
-I'm going home.

01:28:01.883 --> 01:28:04.085
Keep your head up, buddy.
You gave this your all.

01:28:05.787 --> 01:28:06.988
-I did?
-Yeah.

01:28:07.054 --> 01:28:08.956
-I did.
-Like fuck, you did.

01:28:09.023 --> 01:28:10.525
-I did.
-Yeah.

01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:12.292
And you know what?

01:28:12.359 --> 01:28:13.828
Even made some friends.

01:28:15.362 --> 01:28:16.831
That's goddamn right.

01:28:18.065 --> 01:28:19.534
Hey, Art,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.903
you've been
a hell of a fucking friend.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.171
-Truly.
-Yeah.

01:28:24.772 --> 01:28:26.174
Thanks.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.276
-Thanks, both of y'all.
-Of course.

01:28:29.644 --> 01:28:31.279
Could y'all do something for me?

01:28:31.344 --> 01:28:33.346
- Absolutely.
- Anything, <i>compadre.</i>

01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:46.727
Could you give this
to my grandma, if you make it?

01:28:46.794 --> 01:28:47.829
Of course.

01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:50.363
Of course.

01:28:55.435 --> 01:28:56.904
Promise me one thing.

01:28:56.971 --> 01:28:58.039
Yeah.

01:28:59.974 --> 01:29:01.408
Don't watch 'em do it.

01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:03.077
-Okay.
-Okay? Promise me. Promise me.

01:29:03.144 --> 01:29:04.245
-I promise.
-Promise me!

01:29:04.312 --> 01:29:06.147
I promise. I promise.

01:29:11.085 --> 01:29:12.119
Thanks.

01:29:15.089 --> 01:29:16.791
I'm going home.

01:29:16.858 --> 01:29:18.292
I'm going home.

01:29:18.358 --> 01:29:19.594
Just a little longer.

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:20.962
-I'm going home.
-Just a little longer.

01:29:21.028 --> 01:29:22.395
I'm going home.

01:29:22.462 --> 01:29:24.098
- I can't, man.
<i>- Warning.</i>

01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:26.466
<i>-Second warning, six.</i>
-I just...

01:29:26.534 --> 01:29:28.368
I fucking can't, man.

01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:37.377
Do you know what I want
more than anything?

01:29:37.444 --> 01:29:40.147
- What, Pete?
<i>- Third and final warning.</i>

01:29:40.214 --> 01:29:41.749
An Orange Julius.

01:30:01.836 --> 01:30:04.171
You're in the homestretch.

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:06.908
For better or for worse,

01:30:06.974 --> 01:30:08.175
there's going to be wheat,

01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:11.444
and there's going to be chaff.

01:30:11.512 --> 01:30:14.916
You choose, boys.
Remember, you choose.

01:30:14.982 --> 01:30:16.984
Shut the fuck up!

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:19.153
Holy shit!

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.188
Suck a dick, will you?
I mean, just...

01:30:21.255 --> 01:30:22.790
You fucking lotus-eater.

01:30:22.857 --> 01:30:24.825
You old sack of shit. Shut up!

01:30:24.892 --> 01:30:27.361
- That's the spirit, my boy.
- Oh, my God.

01:30:27.427 --> 01:30:29.997
That's a killer
fuckin' instinct.

01:30:30.064 --> 01:30:31.832
Take no prisoners.

01:30:31.899 --> 01:30:35.870
Flex that sac
and go get that prize.

01:30:35.937 --> 01:30:39.307
<i>- Warning, 23 and 47.</i>
- Fuck.

01:30:39.373 --> 01:30:41.208
<i>-Second warning, 38.</i>
-I'm done.

01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:43.644
What would happen

01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:47.014
if we slowed
at the exact same time, huh?

01:30:47.081 --> 01:30:49.884
There's no way any three humans

01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:51.986
could measure exactness
like these instruments.

01:30:52.053 --> 01:30:54.155
They have it down to a science.

01:30:54.221 --> 01:30:56.057
Increments.

01:30:56.123 --> 01:30:57.358
How the fuck do you know so much

01:30:57.425 --> 01:30:58.993
about the Long Walk, anyway?

01:31:00.861 --> 01:31:02.630
It's all on record.

01:31:02.697 --> 01:31:03.998
You ever read a book?
It ain't too hard.

01:31:04.065 --> 01:31:05.366
Come on. Come on. No, come on!

01:31:05.433 --> 01:31:06.667
Come on, man.

01:31:06.734 --> 01:31:08.569
It's almost over.

01:31:08.636 --> 01:31:10.404
Say something real.

01:31:14.809 --> 01:31:17.244
-I'm the rabbit.
-Huh?

01:31:18.279 --> 01:31:19.981
I'm the fucking rabbit.

01:31:21.582 --> 01:31:23.217
You've seen them.

01:31:23.284 --> 01:31:25.553
Those little gray
mechanical rabbits

01:31:25.619 --> 01:31:28.089
that the greyhounds chase
at the dog races.

01:31:29.724 --> 01:31:31.425
'Cause no matter
how fast the dogs run,

01:31:31.491 --> 01:31:34.161
they never can quite catch up
to the rabbit,

01:31:34.228 --> 01:31:36.364
because the rabbit
isn't flesh and blood.

01:31:38.299 --> 01:31:40.401
Maybe you're right, Garraty.

01:31:40.468 --> 01:31:43.371
Maybe we should stop
being rabbits and pigs,

01:31:44.305 --> 01:31:46.574
and goats and sheep and...

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.209
just be people.

01:31:49.677 --> 01:31:51.112
Real people...

01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:52.947
who bleed.

01:31:54.915 --> 01:31:56.217
You wanna know
how I know so much

01:31:56.283 --> 01:31:57.551
about the Long Walk?

01:32:00.187 --> 01:32:02.156
The Major's my father.

01:32:03.824 --> 01:32:05.393
I'm his bastard.

01:32:06.994 --> 01:32:09.563
I didn't think
he knew I was his son.

01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:11.399
That's where I made my mistake.

01:32:12.299 --> 01:32:13.868
He's got dozens of us.

01:32:17.138 --> 01:32:18.472
For my wish,
I was gonna ask to be taken

01:32:18.539 --> 01:32:19.907
into my father's home.

01:32:22.043 --> 01:32:23.477
To be invited for tea.

01:32:28.449 --> 01:32:30.584
But I guess this rabbit
is flesh and blood.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.555
And this flesh and blood
is failing me now.

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:37.725
I can feel my liver going,

01:32:37.792 --> 01:32:39.693
my lungs filling with fluid.

01:32:41.028 --> 01:32:43.130
And I'd like to end this shit

01:32:43.197 --> 01:32:45.266
with my head held high,

01:32:46.267 --> 01:32:48.302
instead of crawling on my belly,

01:32:48.369 --> 01:32:50.671
like a reptile choking
on my own mucus.

01:32:54.875 --> 01:32:56.410
Think it'll rain tonight, boys?

01:33:00.047 --> 01:33:02.616
I don't know,
but it looks that way.

01:33:04.218 --> 01:33:05.886
I always loved the rain.

01:33:07.688 --> 01:33:08.722
Hey.

01:33:10.658 --> 01:33:11.759
I'm sorry.

01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:21.836
There's gonna be crowds.

01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.504
They allow them
when there's two.

01:33:23.572 --> 01:33:24.605
The real diehards.

01:33:24.672 --> 01:33:26.307
The ones who will walk with you.

01:33:26.373 --> 01:33:29.376
The ones that wanna see
the Major do the final kill.

01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:31.912
Just keep walkin', okay?

01:33:33.747 --> 01:33:35.116
I'm glad it's you two.

01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:38.919
Nice walking with you, Stebbins.

01:33:40.287 --> 01:33:41.322
An honor.

01:33:42.456 --> 01:33:43.724
Good luck.

01:33:45.759 --> 01:33:49.063
<i>Third warning, 38.</i>
<i>Final warning.</i>

01:33:52.066 --> 01:33:53.100
Come on.

01:33:53.801 --> 01:33:54.835
Do me.

01:33:57.539 --> 01:33:59.306
50% chance now, Pete.

01:33:59.373 --> 01:34:01.742
Fucking do me!

01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:24.431
Pete, can I tell you something?

01:34:25.266 --> 01:34:26.333
Sure.

01:34:28.102 --> 01:34:30.437
When I was a kid, right,

01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:32.373
I never really thought
about death.

01:34:33.674 --> 01:34:35.442
You know, I don't think
most kids do

01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:37.444
until you're confronted by it.

01:34:37.512 --> 01:34:39.648
But once I was,
I was scared shitless.

01:34:40.515 --> 01:34:42.883
I was so afraid of it.

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:45.452
But there's something
about being with these boys.

01:34:47.121 --> 01:34:48.523
I don't know, it reminded me

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:51.192
that the only guarantee
you have as a human being

01:34:51.258 --> 01:34:52.893
is that you are going to die.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.263
And if you're lucky,
you get to choose

01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:58.465
how to spend those last moments.

01:34:59.767 --> 01:35:02.136
And, you're right, Pete,
this moment matters.

01:35:02.203 --> 01:35:03.837
Every moment matters.

01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:06.907
Especially at the end.

01:35:08.976 --> 01:35:10.744
I don't know why that calms me.

01:35:14.549 --> 01:35:16.183
But I'm not afraid anymore.

01:35:53.555 --> 01:35:54.888
Make way, make way.

01:35:59.159 --> 01:36:00.761
Back it up, please.
Back it up.

01:36:00.828 --> 01:36:02.263

off the street.

01:36:51.312 --> 01:36:52.346
Okay.

01:37:12.366 --> 01:37:13.735
What'd you do? Ray, Ray.

01:37:13.802 --> 01:37:16.170
I can't. I can't see it,

01:37:16.236 --> 01:37:17.371
but you can.

01:37:18.238 --> 01:37:19.306
