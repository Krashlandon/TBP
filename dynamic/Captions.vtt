WEBVTT

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000
Mozart!

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.480
Mozart!

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280
Forgive your assassin!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.440
I confess, I killed you!

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.680
Si, I killed you, Mozart.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.240
Mozart, pietá!
Forgive your assassin!

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.840
Forgive me, Mozart!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.760
Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.280
Signore, we have
something special for you.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.600
Something you're going to love.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.680
Is that good!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.720
Signore, believe me. . .

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.320
. . .this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.400
Really, you don't know
what you're miss--

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.120
Signore, if you don't
open this door. . .

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.200
. . .we're gonna leave nothing
for you.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.640
And I'm never gonna come
see you again!

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.840
Good morning, Father.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.320
Herr Salieri?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.760
Leave me alone.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.920
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.240
Do you know who I am?

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.600
That makes no difference.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.040
All men are equal in God's eyes.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.600
Are they?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.120
Offer me your confession.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.280
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.560
How well are you trained in music?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.960
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.480
-Where?
-Here in Vienna.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.720
Then you must know this.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.760
I can't say that I do.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.200
What is it?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.560
It was a very popular tune in its day.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.000
I wrote it.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.440
Here, how about this?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.200
This one brought down the house
when we played it.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.160
Well?

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.480
I regret it is not too familiar.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.920
Can you recall no melody of mine?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.120
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.000
I wrote 40 operas alone.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.440
Here!

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.000
What about this one?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.480
Yes, I know that!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.280
That's charming!

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.480
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.120
I didn't.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.560
That was Mozart.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.560
Wolfgang. . .

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.560
. . .Amadeus Mozart.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.480
The man you accuse yourself
of killing.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.080
You've heard that?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280
Is it true?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.000
For God's sake, my son. . .

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.880
. . .if you have something to confess,
do it now.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.000
Give yourself some peace.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.680
He. . .

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.000
. . .was my idol.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.280
Mozart.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.080
I can 't think of a time
when I didn 't know his name.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.080
I was playing games...

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.560
... when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.480
Even the pope in Rome.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.680
I admit, I was jealous...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.120
... when I heard the tales
they told about him.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.680
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.880
...but of his father,
who had taught him everything.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.480
My father, he did not care for music.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.560
When I told him. . .

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.280
. . .how I wished I could be
like Mozart. . .

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.960
...he would say, "Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
You'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?"

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.200
How could I tell him. . .

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.160
. . .what music meant to me?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.480
While my father
prayed earnestly to God...

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.320
... to protect commerce...

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.720
...I would offer up...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.080
...secretly...

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.840
... the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.360
"Lord, make me a great composer.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.560
Let me celebrate your glory
through music...

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.560
...and be celebrated myself.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.640
Make me famous through the world.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.560
Make me immortal.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.320
After I die...

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.360
. . .let people speak my name
with love for what I wrote.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.760
In return. . .

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.880
. . .I will give you my chastity. . .

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.480
. . .my industry. . .

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.840
. . .my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.960
Amen. "

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.640
And do you know what happened?

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.000
A miracle!

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.520
My life changed forever.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.000
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.440
One minute I was a frustrated boy. . .

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.520
. . .in an obscure little town.
The next I was here. . .

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.840
. . .in Vienna, city of musicians. . .

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.720
...and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.920
In a few years, I was his court
composer. Isn 't that incredible?

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.360
Every night I sat with
the emperor of Austria...

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.400
...playing duets with him...

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.240
...correcting the royal sight-reading.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.120
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.520
But what did it matter?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.080
He adored my music.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.760
Tell me. . . .

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
If you had been me. . .

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.520
. . .wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.680
And believe me, I honored it.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.560
I was a model of virtue.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.120
I kept my hands off women.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.800
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.200
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.040
Work, that was all my life.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.360
And it was wonderful.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.080
Everybody liked me.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.320
I liked myself.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.880
Until he came.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.240
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music. . .

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.960
. . .at the residence
of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.600
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.840
That night...

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.880
...changed my life.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.760
As I wandered through the salon...

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.680
...I played a little game with myself.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.320
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4...

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.480
...his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.160
Did it show?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.520
Is talent like that...

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.520
... written on the face?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.440
Which one of them...

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.400
...could he be?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.480
Mozart is not here.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.960
-Stop it!
-I am.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.600
-Stop it!
-I am stopping it.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.840
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.560
There. You see? I've stopped.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.760
-Now we're going back.
-No!

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.600
Yes! You don't know where you are.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.360
Here, everything goes backwards.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.720
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.760
-That's stupid.
-Why? People fart backwards.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.640
Ssa-ym-ssik!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.760
Ssa-ym-ssik!

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.280
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.960
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.480
Ssa-ym-ssik.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.960
Ssik, kiss.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.720
Ym, my. Ssa.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.480
Kiss my ass.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.760
Em-yrram!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.640
-I'm not playing!
-Say it, it's serious.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.240
It's very serious.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.960
Yrram.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480
Marry me.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.360
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.960
Uoy-evol-l-tub.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.400
Tub.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.480
But I. . .

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.160
. . .Iove. . . .

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.880
But I love you?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
-Tihs-ym-tae.
-What?

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.400
-Eat.
-Eat.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.600
-Ym, my.
-My.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.600
Tihs. Eat my shit.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.360
You filthy fiend!

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.480
You filthy--!

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.040
My music.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.760
They've started without me.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.400
That was Mozart!

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.840
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.360
-I think that went well, don't you?
-Indeed.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.040
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.360
Certainly.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.040
Your Grace.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.480
Ah, Mozart.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.600
-Why?
-Why what, sir?

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.760
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests. . .

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.280
. . .by one of my own servants?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.040
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.200
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.480
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.600
-Your father is waiting for you there.
-No, Your Grace!

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.120
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.720
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service. . .

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.600
. . .and learn your place.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.880
On the page it looked....

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.880
Nothing!

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.160
The beginning simple, almost comic.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.960
Just a pulse.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.840
Bassoons, basset horns. . .

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.040
. . .like a rusty squeezebox.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.560
And then, suddenly. . .

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.960
. . .high above it. . .

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.960
. . .an oboe.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.440
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.480
Until. . .

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.600
. . .a clarinet took it over. . .

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.440
. . .sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.680
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.880
This was a music I had never heard.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.640
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.040
It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.520
Excuse me.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.760
But why?

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.560
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.280
It was not to be believed.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.120
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.920
It better be.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.360
How good is he, this Mozart?

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.160
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.800
-Idomeneo, King of Crete.
-That?

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.120
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.040
Tiresome?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.280
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.840
Too much spice.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.200
Too many notes.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.080
Majesty. . .

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.800
. . .it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.640
Then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.200
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.080
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say. . .

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.320
. . .an opera in German
for our National Theater.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.760
Excellent, sire!

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.760
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.360
Italian is the proper language
for opera.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.280
All educated people agree on that.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800
What do you think, chamberlain?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.680
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.360
Plain German for plain people.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.920
Kapellmeister?

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.720
Majesty. . .

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.160
. . .I must agree with Herr Direttore.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.880
German is. . .

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.800
. . .too brute for singing.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.720
Court composer. . .

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.600
. . .what do you think?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.680
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.640
It should infuriate the archbishop. . .

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.920
. . .if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.600
You are cattivo, court composer.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.840
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.080
Well, there it is!

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.960
This is a beautiful wig for you.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.120
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.600
The other one.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.080
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.080
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.960
-How do you like it?
-They're all so beautiful!

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.920
Why don't I have three heads?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.360
This is funny!

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.880
Three heads!

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.400
Gentlemen.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.560
-Good morning.
-Morning, Your Majesty.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.120
What do you have for me today?

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.440
-Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
-Yes, what about him?

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.640
He's here.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.840
Well, there it is. Good!

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.560
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.800
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.400
Just a. . . .

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.280
Just a trifle, of course.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.840
May I try it?

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.400
Let's have some fun.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.040
Delightful, court composer!

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.000
May I play it when he comes in?

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.720
-You do me too much honor.
-Bring in Herr Mozart.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.600
But slowly.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.440
I need a minute to practice.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.240
Good, continue.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.960
G, Majesty.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.000
Excellent!

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.880
Good, Majesty.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.560
Continue. Very good.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.440
Very good, Majesty.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.200
Tempo! Up.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.120
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.960
Again.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Bravo, Majesty!

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.920
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.640
No, please. It's not a holy relic.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.360
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.480
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.760
As he got off the stool, he fell.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.880
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.000
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.720
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.680
-I'm a great admirer of yours.
-Thank you.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.560
Kapellmeister Bonno.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.800
My pleasure.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.640
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.040
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.520
Here is our
illustrious court composer. . .

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.640
. . .Maestro Salieri.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.480
At last, such immense joy!

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.280
I know your work well.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.080
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.240
-Really? Which one?
-"Mio Caro Adone. "

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.840
I'm flattered.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.160
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.240
And now he has returned
the compliment.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.040
Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.920
Really?

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.760
Well, there it is.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.320
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.400
What do you say?

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.120
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.040
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.280
Did we?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.320
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.880
-German. Please let it be German.
-Why so?

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.120
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.600
Have I seen it?

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.360
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.920
-I'll show it to you immediately.
-I think you'd better.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.520
Well. . .

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.080
. . .tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.280
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.200
It's set--
The whole thing is set in a. . . .

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.320
Yes? Where?

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.560
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.120
-You mean in Turkey?
-Yes, exactly.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.640
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.400
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.600
No, my dear fellow, the language
is not finally the point.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.360
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.560
Why not? It's charming.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.040
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their. . . .

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.120
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.120
It's full of proper German virtues.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.720
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.840
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.600
Well, tell him, Mozart.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.360
Name us a German virtue.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.560
-Love, sire.
-Oh, love!

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.320
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about love.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.320
No, I don't think you do.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.120
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching. . .

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:13.320
. . .stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.040
Majesty, you choose the language.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.800
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.600
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.200
This is yours.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.120
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.560
What? On one hearing only?

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.040
I think so, sire. Yes.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.120
Show us.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.840
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.520
That doesn't really work, does it?

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.040
Did you try. . .?

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.840
Shouldn't it be a bit more. . .?

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.920
Or this?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.120
This. Yes.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.320
Better? What do you think?

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.600
Grazie, Signore.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.040
All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.560
He gave me that longing. . .

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.320
. . .and then made me mute. Why?

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.600
Tell me that.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.560
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music. . .

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.560
. . .why implant the desire. . .

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.800
. . .like a lust in my body?

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.720
And then deny me the talent?

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.600
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.560
Maestro.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.280
Well. . .?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.600
How do you like it?

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.520
It's Turkish.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.280
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.320
Does he?

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.600
What else did he tell you today?

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.360
Come, come! Give me some gossip.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.800
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.520
News travels fast in Vienna.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.320
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.320
-Yes.
-Is there a part in it for me?

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.200
-No.
-How do you know?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.120
-Do you know where it's set, my dear?
-Where?

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.120
In a harem.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.360
-What's that?
-A brothel.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.960
Come.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.840
Let's begin.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.840
-What does he look like?
-Mozart?

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.720
-You might be disappointed.
-Why?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.920
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.960
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.360
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.120
Shall we continue?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.920
There she was.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.120
I don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.720
On stage, for all to see.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.920
Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.360
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.720
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.920
Understand, I was
in love with the girl.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.920
Or at least in lust.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.360
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.040
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.120
Least of all, "the creature. "

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.520
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.040
Your Majesty.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.640
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.560
Well, decidedly that.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.480
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something. . .

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.400
-. . .quite new tonight.
-It is new.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.200
-It is, isn't it, sire?
-Yes, indeed.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.800
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Well, of course I did! It's very good!

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.280
Of course, now and then,
just now and then. . .

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.040
. . .it seemed a touch. . . .

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.360
What do you mean, sire?

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.800
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have. . . .

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.000
How shall one say. . .?

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.120
How shall one say, direktor?

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.880
-Too many notes, Majesty?
-Exactly. Very well put.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.280
-Too many notes.
-I don't understand.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.040
There are just as many notes
as I required, neither more nor less.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.920
My dear fellow, there are in fact. . .

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:00.040
. . .only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.320
I think I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.760
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.000
This is absurd!

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.440
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.320
It's quality work.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.080
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.560
Which few did you have in mind?

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.280
Wolfgang!

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.080
Wolfgang, my dear!

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.800
-Wolfgang!
-Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.520
She's my landlady.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.640
-Enchanted, madame.
-Sire, such an honor!

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.520
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.520
-She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
-Really?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.160
How charming. Please.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.240
Well. . .

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.160
. . .when do you marry?

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.880
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.120
Not entirely. Not altogether.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.480
-Excuse me, but how old are you?
-26.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.480
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady. . .

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.000
-. . .and stay with us in Vienna.
-You see?

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.320
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.360
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful. . .

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.280
. . .such royal advice. May I. . .?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.440
Well, there it is.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.360
Wolfie, will you get some water?

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.000
Will you get some water, please?

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.600
Wolfie, get some water!

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.320
Did you know?

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.800
-What?
-The marriage.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.040
What does it matter to you?

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.080
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.320
How was I?

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.640
You were sublime.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.960
And what did you think of the music?

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.480
Extremely clever.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.560
Katerina, l--

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.320
Excuse me.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.720
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:40.320
-No, she's fine.
-Oh, I'm so relieved.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.080
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.680
-Did you like it then?
-How could I not?

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.800
It's the best music
in Vienna today, don't you agree?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.120
She must be dazzling in bed.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.840
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.920
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.920
Come in.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.560
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.440
-Can we go home?
-Yes.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.880
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.840
This is his night.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.640
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.520
Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.200
At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt...

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.480
...he'd had her.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:43.240
The creature had had my darling girl.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.600
It was incomprehensible!

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.760
What was God up to?

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.280
Was it possible I was being tested?

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.960
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness. . .

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.960
. . .in the face of every offense?

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.000
No matter how painful?

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.240
It's very possible.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.920
But why him?

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:25.160
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.680
My heart was filling up. . .

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.000
. . .with such hatred
for that little man.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.280
For the first time in my life,
I began to know. . .

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.200
. . .really. . .

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.960
. . .violent thoughts.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:47.240
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.080
Lord. . .

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.760
. . .please. . .

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.680
. . .send him away. . .

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.640
. . .back to Salzburg.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.800
For his sake. . .

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.080
. . .as well as mine.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.080
-No! I won't have him back.
-But, Your Grace--

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:17.680
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.080
Yes, sir. . .

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.000
. . .that is the truth.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.480
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.640
I was too indulgent with him.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.160
Please, Your Grace?

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.200
Give him one more chance?

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.880
You have leave to try.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.240
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.400
I thank you!

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.520
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.600
Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.920
As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours...

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.080
...do as I bid, and await my coming.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.440
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.240
Those whom God hath joined together. . .

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.520
. . .let no man put asunder.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.440
Beloved father:

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:55.160
You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.160
With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.840
... you'll live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.080
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.560
Your Highness.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.080
She's asked me to recommend
a music instructor.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.040
-I've come up with an excellent idea.
-Your Majesty!

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.200
It would be such a tremendous honor!

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.680
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.480
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but. . . .

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.400
Yes?

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.240
My concern is to protect you. . .

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.320
. . .from any hint of favoritism.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.400
Favoritism.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.240
-What is this?
-What is what?

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:04.320
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl?

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.280
Because His Majesty wishes it.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.720
Is the emperor angry with me?

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:15.360
-Quite the contrary.
-Then why not appoint me to the post?

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.760
You are not
the only composer in Vienna.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.280
No. But I'm the best.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.120
Mozart.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.000
A little modesty
might suit you better.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120
Who is on this committee?

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.160
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.920
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.920
They're all musical idiots!

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.360
-And you want them to judge my music?
-Young man. . .

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.560
. . .the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position. . .

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:07.200
. . .you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.280
Must I?

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.840
Well, I won't.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.240
How are we supposed to live?

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.680
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.920
Don't be stupid.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.720
-All they want to see is your work.
-Shit.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.840
-What's wrong with that?
-Shut up! Just shut up.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:35.360
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.760
They'll come anyway.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.960
-No, they won't.
-They love me here.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.960
-I know how things work in this city.
-You know everything, don't you?

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.160
-Yes?
-Excuse me, sir.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.320
-A lady insists on talking to you.
-Who?

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.080
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.440
Excuse me, my dear.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.000
Your Excellency.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.800
How can I help you?

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.840
-Frau Mozart?
-I've come on behalf of my husband.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:53.680
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.440
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.000
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.840
I understand.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.520
I will look at them the moment I can.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.120
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:23.720
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to look at them now?

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.680
-While I wait.
-I'm afraid I'm not at leisure. . .

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.440
. . .this precise moment.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.560
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.600
I really cannot do that, sir.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.720
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.920
Then he didn't send you?

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.760
No, sir. This was my own idea.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.880
-I see.
-Sir, we're desperate.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.920
We really need this job.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.720
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:09.240
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.880
It's just that he's not practical.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.440
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.280
Let me offer you some refreshment.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.800
Do you know what these are?

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.920
Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.920
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.680
They're quite surprising.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.480
They're wonderful!

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.440
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.320
Don't keep calling me that.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.800
Keeps me at such a distance.

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.640
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.960
I'm from a small town.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.320
Just like your husband.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.640
Are you sure you can't. . .

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.520
. . .leave this and come back again?

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.600
It's very tempting, sir.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.120
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.720
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.760
You see, they're all originals.

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.040
-Originals?
-Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.560
These. . .

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.240
. . .are originals?

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.200
Astounding!

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.200
It was actually--
It was beyond belief.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.600
These were first and only. . .

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.360
...drafts of music.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:45.240
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.360
He had simply written down music...

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.560
. . .already finished in his head.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.360
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.080
And music. . .

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.320
. . .finished as no music
is ever finished.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.080
Displace one note. . .

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.160
. . .and there would be diminishment.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.640
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.840
It was clear to me...

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.400
... that sound I had heard
in the archbishop 's palace...

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.560
...had been no accident.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.400
Here again
was the very voice of God.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.280
I was staring through the cage. . .

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.160
. . .of those meticulous ink strokes. . .

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480
. . .at an absolute beauty.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.320
Is it not good?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.480
It is miraculous.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.880
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.480
So you will help us?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.600
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.280
One word from me and the post is his.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.280
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.080
Come back tonight.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.800
-Tonight?
-Alone.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.640
What for?

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.000
Some service
deserves service in return.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.360
No?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.600
-What do you mean?
-Isn't it obvious?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.720
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.920
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.120
I'm a married woman, sir.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.000
Then don't.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.480
It's up to you.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.320
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.800
There is no God of mercy, Father.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.040
Just a God of torture.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.240
Evening came.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.000
I sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.480
I prayed as I had
never prayed before.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.760
Dear God...

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.320
...enter me now.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.160
Fill me with one piece of true music.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.680
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.880
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.680
I will get him the royal position.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.880
Enter me.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.000
Please.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.520
Please!

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.440
Yes?

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.480
That lady is back, sir.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.120
Show her in.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.480
Well?

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.880
I'm here.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.840
My husband has gone to a concert.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.520
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.080
Well, where shall we go?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.040
Should we stay here?

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.240
Well. . . .

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.640
Do you still want to look at these?

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.680
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.480
Suppose we don't, really.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.560
Show this woman out.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.640
Stanzi.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.200
Stanzi.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.920
What is it?

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.280
What's the matter? Tell me.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.440
Tell me.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.160
I love you.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.280
I love you.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.280
From now on, we are enemies.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.040
You and I.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.200
Because you choose
for your instrument...

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.240
...a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.360
...and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.960
Because you are unjust...

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.040
...unfair...

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.240
...unkind...

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.240
...I will block you.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.200
I swear it.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.480
I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.040
...as far as I am able.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.960
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.720
Of course not.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.040
I have to tell you.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.280
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.360
Really?

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.640
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer. . .

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.880
. . .Maria Theresa Paradis. . .

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.280
. . .told me she was. . . .

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.040
Well. . . .

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.280
Well, what?

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.440
Molested, Majesty.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.960
Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.040
There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.880
-Whom did they choose?
-Herr Zummer.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.360
Herr Zummer?

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.240
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.280
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.440
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760
Excellency, please.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.960
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor. . .

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.360
. . .and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.640
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.240
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.840
Look. . .

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.880
. . .I must have pupils.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.960
Without pupils, I can't manage.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.880
You don't mean
you're living in poverty?

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.440
No, but I'm broke.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.760
Well, how is this possible?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.960
I hear your concerts are
quite successful.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.280
They're stupendously successful.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.280
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.280
They want to hear me play. . .

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.280
. . .but they won't let me teach
their daughters, as if I was a fiend.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480
Seriously. . .

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.160
. . .is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.040
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.480
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.440
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.480
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.040
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.240
You name the terms.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.640
Well, how exciting.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.240
Tell me more.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.880
-It's a bit of a secret.
-Come, come. I'm interested.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.720
This is delicious. What is it?

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.480
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar. . .

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.040
. . .suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.880
Italian.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.480
Forgive me. We all have
patriotic feelings of some kind.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.680
Two thou--

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.280
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.880
A hundred.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.640
Fifty.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.840
What exactly are you working on?

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.720
Really, I can't say.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.480
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.240
However. . .

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.640
. . .I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and. . .

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.040
. . .he has a daughter.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.640
Quiet! Quiet!

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.880
Herr Mozart.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.840
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they're impossible.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.280
I treat them just like
my own children.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.040
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.680
That's funny.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.160
You're a funny fellow.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.840
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.040
Of course it'll be
to his satisfaction.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.200
Come, we're going to listen
to some music. Come!

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840
Good boy.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.960
Now.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.440
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.480
Anything will do.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.240
Just go ahead.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.280
Just as if we weren't here.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.480
Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.280
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.480
We're both a little shy.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.040
Play.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.440
-I said play!
-Michael, please.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.960
Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fräulein.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.760
Why don't you let me try?

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.440
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.480
We've got to break him of that habit.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.200
We've got to break them
of their habit!

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.680
Play. Please.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.360
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.880
That's it. That's it.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.200
Keep playing!

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160
Keep playing! That's it!

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.840
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.880
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, let me know.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.840
Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.880
Papa?

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.440
Papa!

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.280
Why are you here?

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.240
Am I not welcome?

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.040
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:50.440
You're very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.960
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.760
-Is she not here?
-No, she had to help her mother.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.760
She's like that.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.040
Her mother's a very
sweet woman, you'Il--

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.040
I didn't know you were home.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.440
Stanzi, this is my father.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.200
We'll wait. We'll wait.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.240
Why don't you get up now, my darling?

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.040
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.160
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.040
Don't you have a maid?

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.880
Oh. No. We could if we wanted. . .

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.480
. . .but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.200
How is your. . .

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.480
. . .financial situation?

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.840
Couldn't be better.

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.720
That's not what I hear.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.880
What do you mean? It's wonderful.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.440
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.760
They say you have debts.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.680
Who?

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.240
Who says that?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.760
That's a malicious lie!

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.200
Do you have pupils?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.760
I don't want pupils!

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.440
They get in the way.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.360
I have to have time for composition.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.680
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.840
That one will.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.280
What's that?

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.480
It's a secret.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.720
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.480
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.840
You'll be so proud of me.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.480
It'll be the best thing I've
ever done. The best thing anyone--

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.240
There she is!

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.640
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.480
-Could you want a prettier daughter?
-Stop it, Wolfie!

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.440
I look dreadful.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.040
Are you. . .

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.480
. . .expecting?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.680
-Yes, I am.
-Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.040
-May I offer you some tea?
-Who wants tea? Let's go out!

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.040
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.480
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.040
How can you be so boring? Tea!

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.240
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.240
Here we go. Good day.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.440
Now!

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.720
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.280
And the penalty is. . . .

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.480
-Give her a good one!
-Show us your legs!

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.240
Come on, come on!

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.440
It's just a game, Papa.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.880
Thank you.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:03.840
Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.040
Yes, Papa. Name it.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.840
Name it. I'll do anything
you say. Anything.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.160
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.840
The penalty must be
performed in the room.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.040
I'm tired of this game.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.960
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.720
I name a penalty!

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.960
The penalty is. . .

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.720
. . .you shall play our tune. . .

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.480
. . .in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:18.360
-Turn him over!
-Over?!

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.040
Now you play it backwards!

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.040
-Another one! Give me another one!
-Play it like Gluck!

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.960
-Boring. Another!
-Handel!

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.640
I don't like him! Another one!

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.280
Play Salieri.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.720
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.880
Please! Please!

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.280
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.160
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.960
That was God.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.840
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.640
Go on, Signore. Laugh.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.040
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.280
One day I will laugh at you.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.280
Before I leave this earth. . .

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.280
. . .I will laugh at you.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.720
-Wolfie?
-What?

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.720
There's a young girl here to see you.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.440
What does she want?

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.200
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.040
Damn.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.280
Yes?

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.040
-Are you Herr Mozart?
-That's right.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.720
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.920
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.320
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain. . .

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.480
. . .anonymous.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.040
Is this your idea, Papa?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.240
Mine?

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.800
-Are you playing a trick on me?
-I've never seen this girl.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.320
-Is this some kind of joke?
-Not at all, sir.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.920
Young woman, this won't do.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.560
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous. . .

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.240
-. . .unless he knows who's behind it.
-I can't tell you that, sir.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.680
-This is ridiculous!
-What is ridiculous?

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.600
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.560
People send us gifts all the time.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.800
You cannot accept her
without references.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.960
Well, this is none of your business.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.960
-Whoever sent you is going to pay?
-That's right.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.520
Splendid! Now we're going
to let a stranger into our house.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.920
Who is we? Who is letting who--?

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.400
-Could you please wait outside?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.960
Look, old man!

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.680
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.120
-And now--
-Stanzi!

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.840
No! It's right that he should hear!
I'm sick to death of it.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.560
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.600
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.480
I'm leaving.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.800
-No, Papa.
-I won't stay and be a burden.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.960
No one calls you that.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.600
She does. She says I sleep all day.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.640
And so you do!

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.080
The only time you come out is to eat.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.600
Well, what do you expect?

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.640
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.640
-So now I'm a bad housekeeper!
-So you are. It's a pigsty.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.040
When can you start?

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.480
-Right away, ma'am.
-Good.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.360
They're out every night, sir.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760
Thank you, sir.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.520
Do any pupils come to the house?

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.600
Not that I've seen.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.600
Then how does he pay for all this?

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.920
Does he work at all?

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:26.080
Yes, sir. All day long. He never
leaves the house till evening.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.320
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.320
Really?

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.960
What is it he's writing?

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.480
I wouldn't know that, sir.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.520
Of course not.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.720
You're a good girl.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.320
You're very kind to do this.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:52.160
The next time you're sure they'll
be out of the house, let me know.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.720
Thank you, sir.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.320
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.720
Yes? What?

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:52.880
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.440
And now look.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.760
There's only one left.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.240
Where does he work?

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.960
In there, sir.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.800
Gentlemen, I've just
heard some news. . .

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.360
-. . .that may interest you.
-What?

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.960
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.560
Italian?

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.600
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.000
The Marriage of Figaro.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.760
He's setting that play to music?

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.480
Yes.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:23.120
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.800
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.240
It has been banned by the emperor.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.520
You're absolutely sure?

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.400
Herr Mozart.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.520
Gentlemen, sit down.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.960
Mozart.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.480
Are you aware that I have declared
the French play Figaro...

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.560
. . .unsuitable for our theater?

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.560
Yes, sire.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.880
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.760
Who told you this, Majesty?

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.600
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.800
Yes, I. . . .

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.560
I admit it is.

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.200
Would you tell me why?

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.720
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.720
What you think is scarcely the point.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.680
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.040
But, Your Majesty--

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.120
Mozart. . .

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.560
. . .I am a tolerant man.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.720
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.560
Figaro is a bad play.

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.880
It stirs up hatred between classes.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.120
In France, it has caused
only bitterness.

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.680
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.480
I swear, there's nothing
like that in the piece.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.600
I've taken out everything that could
give offense. I hate politics.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.360
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.720
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our people. . .

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.200
. . .simply over a theater piece.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.520
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.680
"Love. " Again!

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.720
And it's new!

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.040
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.440
I have scenes. . . .

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.680
The end of Act II, for example.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.960
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.280
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.280
Duet turns into trio.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.400
Then the husband's valet comes in.

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.440
Trio turns into quartet.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.600
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.760
And so on, on and on.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.560
Sextet, septet, octet.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.560
How long do you think
I can sustain that?

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.800
I have no idea.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.400
Guess.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.800
Guess, Your Majesty.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.000
Imagine the longest time
it could be sustained, then double it.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.480
Well. . . .

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.400
Six. . .

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.520
. . .seven minutes?

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.680
-Eight minutes?
-Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.200
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.080
Sire, only opera can do this.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.240
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once. . .

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.400
. . .it's just noise.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.160
But with opera, with music. . .

01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.480
. . .you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.720
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.240
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.800
No one doubts your talent. It's your
literary judgment that's in question.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Even with the politics taken out,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.080
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:26.360
Surely you can choose more
elevated themes.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.720
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.680
I am fed to the teeth with these. . .

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.160
. . .elevated things. Old dead legends.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.480
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends?

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.640
Because they do.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.640
They go on forever.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.360
At least what they represent:
the eternal in us.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.360
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.120
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.680
"Bello, bello, bello. "
Come on now, be honest!

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:12.600
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser
than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.840
People so lofty, they sound
as if they shit marble!

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.360
What!

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.760
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.080
Forgive me, Majesty.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.640
I'm a vulgar man. . .

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.080
. . .but I assure you, my music is not.

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.920
You are passionate, Mozart. . .

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.080
. . .but you do not persuade.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.480
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.960
Do you know how much work
went into it?

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:04.600
His Majesty has been
more than patient, Signore.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.040
How can I persuade if I can't show it?

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.240
That will do, Herr Mozart.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.000
Just let me tell you how it begins.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.080
May I just do that, Majesty?
Show you how it begins? Just that?

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.000
Please.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.800
Look. . . .

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.520
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.200
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.440
Do you know what for?

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.360
His bed. His wedding bed.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.840
To see if it will fit!

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.120
Late.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.680
Late!

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.720
On the beat.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.520
Good!

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.240
Yes!

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.400
Early!

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.440
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.760
In that case, gentlemen, I think. . . .

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.080
I think we should help
Mozart all we can.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:45.600
And protect him against
the emperor's anger.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.680
What anger?

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.080
About the ballet.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.120
What ballet?

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.760
Excuse me. . .

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.280
. . .but didn't His Majesty specifically
forbid the ballet in his opera?

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.640
-Herr Mozart!
-Yes?

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.960
-A word with you.
-Certainly, Herr Direktor.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.120
Now, Herr Mozart!

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.920
Five minutes, please.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.480
Five minutes!

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.360
Yes?

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:59.320
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.400
-It's not a ballet, it's a dance.
-Exactly. A dance.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:09.280
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.960
It's dangerous to interpret his
edicts. Give me your score, please.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.600
Thank you.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:31.760
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.560
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.440
Please. Please!

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.280
I have no one else to turn to.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.160
-What is it?
-It's unbelievable.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.480
The direktor has torn up
a huge section of my music.

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:52.920
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.040
But it's perfect as it is.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.560
I can't. . .

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.280
. . .rewrite what's perfect.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.520
Please.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.080
Can't you talk to him?

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:07.840
Please.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:10.840
Why bother?
He's no friend of yours.

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.720
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.920
I threw the entire score into
the fire, he made me so angry.

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:26.400
-You burned the score?
-No, my wife took it out in time.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.360
Thank God.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:36.120
It's unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work!

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:40.800
But there are those
who have power over him.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.840
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.320
Excellency. . .

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.760
. . .would you?

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.280
With all my heart, Mozart.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.840
Thank you.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:04.080
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic. "

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.000
I don't need to tell you I said
nothing, whatever, to the emperor.

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.960
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything. . .

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.160
... when suddenly,
in the middle of the third act...

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.560
... to my astonishment, the emperor...

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.320
... who never attended rehearsals,
suddenly appeared.

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.160
What is this?

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.600
I don't understand.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.000
Is it modern?

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.800
Majesty. . .

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.760
. . .the Herr Direktor...

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:05.880
. . .he has removed un balletto...

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.560
. . .that would have occurred
at this place.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.000
Why?

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.440
It is your regulation, sire.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.680
No ballet in your opera.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.200
Salieri.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.320
Do you like this?

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.480
It's not a question
of liking, Majesty.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.760
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.760
Well, look at them!

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.080
No! This is nonsense!

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.400
-Let me see the scene with the music.
-But, sire!

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.040
Oblige me!

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.320
Yes, Majesty.

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.600
Can we see the scene
with the music, please?

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.200
Certainly! Certainly, Herr Direktor!

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.560
Bring the palace set back in, please.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.320
The restored third act. . .

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.920
. . .was bold, brilliant.

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.760
The fourth. . .

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.200
. . .was astounding.

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.720
I saw a woman...

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.680
...disguised in her maid's clothes
hear her husband speak the first...

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.360
... tender words he has
offered her in years.

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:34.280
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.360
I heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater...

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.080
...conferring on all who sat there,
perfect absolution.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.040
God was singing through
this little man...

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.800
... to all the world.

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.400
Unstoppable.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:00.000
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.960
And then, do you know what happened?

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.720
A miracle!

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.200
With that yawn...

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.520
...I saw my defeat
turn into a victory.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.120
Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.840
Three yawns...

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.040
. . .and the opera
would fail the same night.

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:14.640
Two yawns, within a week at most.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.800
With one yawn, the composer
could still get. . . .

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.320
Nine performances! Nine!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.800
I know, I know.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.760
It's outrageous.

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.200
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work. . .

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.080
. . .one has to accept
the fact gracefully.

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.280
But what is it that they don't like?

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.240
I can speak for the emperor.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.640
You make too many demands
on the royal ear.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.200
The poor man can't concentrate for
more than an hour. You gave him four.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.360
What did you think of it yourself?

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.000
Did you like it at all?

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.200
I thought it was marvelous.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:13.160
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:15.000
I know it!

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.600
Why didn't they come?

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:26.160
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, friend.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:29.920
You didn't give them a bang
at the end of songs. . .

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.600
. . .to let them know when to clap.

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:35.800
I know, I know.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.440
Maybe you should give me
some lessons in that.

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.960
I wouldn't presume.

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.160
Nevertheless,
at the risk of imposing. . .

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:52.400
. . .I'd like you to see my new piece.

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.800
It would be an honor for me.

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:58.720
No, the honor would be all mine.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.520
I believe. . . .

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.760
I believe. . .

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:33.880
. . .it is the best opera
yet written, my friends.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.640
Salieri!

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.080
You are the brightest star
in the musical firmament.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.800
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.800
Herr Mozart!

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.840
-It was good of you to come.
-How could I not?

01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.040
Bravo, maestro.

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.040
Did my work please you?

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:30.400
I never knew that music
like that was possible.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:34.360
-You flatter me.
-No.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:37.640
One hears such sounds. . .

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.280
. . .and what can one say but: Salieri!

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:54.240
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
Bravo! Well, I've got some more.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.200
You remember my good
friend Schikaneder. Come in.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:59.680
Don't be shy.

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.120
-This is a very nice girl, and this--
-Wolfie?

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.160
Yes, my love?

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.240
-These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
-Salzburg?

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.320
We were just talking about Salzburg.

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.120
Your father is dead.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.120
So rose the dreadful ghost. . .

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.720
. . .from his next and blackest opera.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:59.440
There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.200
I knew. . .

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.160
. . .only I understood. . .

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:06.720
. . .that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold. . .

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.560
. . .raised from the dead!

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:42.160
Wolfgang had actually
summoned up his own father. . .

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.080
. . .to accuse his son
before all the world!

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.320
It was. . .

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.960
. . .terrifying and wonderful to watch.

01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.520
And now. . .

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.120
. . .the madness began in me.

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.920
The madness of a man
splitting in half.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.120
Through my influence, I saw to it. . .

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.200
...Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:28.080
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.160
Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.

01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:23.320
And as I stood there,
understanding how...

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:27.160
. . .that bitter old man was
still possessing his poor son. . .

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.040
...even from beyond the grave...

01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.160
...I began to see a way...

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.200
...a terrible way...

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.240
. . .I could finally triumph. . .

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.360
. . .over God.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.120
Herr Mozart?

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.200
I have come to commission
work from you.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.000
-What work?
-A Mass for the dead.

02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.160
What dead?

02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.600
Who is dead?

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:12.480
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass
and never got one.

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:16.240
-Who are you?
-I am only a messenger.

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.720
Do you accept?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.360
You will be well paid.

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:31.160
Do you accept?

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.280
Work fast.

02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:46.240
And be sure tell no one what you do.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.920
You will see me again soon.

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.840
Wolfie?

02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.880
My plan was so simple. . .

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:44.360
. . .that it terrified me.

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.440
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then. . .

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:55.440
. . .I must achieve his death.

02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.600
What?

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.560
His funeral!

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.640
Imagine it!

02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.000
The cathedral,
all Vienna sitting there.

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:12.560
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:14.960
And then. . .

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:17.840
. . .in that silence. . .

02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:22.000
. . .music.

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.600
A divine music. . .

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.720
. . .bursts out over them all.

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.000
A great Mass of death.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:38.280
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:42.720
Composed by his devoted friend. . .

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.920
. . .Antonio Salieri.

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.600
What sublimity!

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.360
What depth!

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:54.680
What passion in the music!

02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:59.320
Salieri has been touched
by God at last. . .

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.120
. . .and God forced to listen!

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:07.120
Powerless to stop it!

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:10.800
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him!

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:22.560
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.160
How does one do that?

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:28.640
How does one kill a man?

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:31.840
It's one thing. . .

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.480
. . .to dream about it.

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:37.960
Very different when you. . . .

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.680
When you have to do it. . .

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:47.640
. . .with your own hands.

02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.960
Come in!

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:20.040
I've come to dinner

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:23.080
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:26.720
I only ever dine
with people of my own height!

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.680
Stop it!

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.480
Be careful
Be careful

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:34.640
Hold tight

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.360
I'm a famous...

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.360
...horseman

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:44.880
And we're a famous horsy

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.840
Give me a hoof, my darling

02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:56.240
And I'll give you my heart

02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:00.960
Take me to your stable

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.440
And never more we'll part

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:14.600
Kill me
Kill me

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.720
We're going to make a soprano stew

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.600
We're going to make a soprano stew

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.640
And when you make a soprano stew

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.720
Shut up!

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.640
I'm sick to death of that tune!

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.160
Give me some hay, my darling

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.920
And I'll give you my heart

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.360
Leporello! Some hay!

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:16.280
We hope...

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.760
... you're contented

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.640
With what...

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:28.960
... we've presented

02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:36.520
And love our dove of peace

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.440
-What did you think?
-It was wonderful!

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.880
-He liked the little people.
-It's all in good fun.

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.280
I liked the horse.

02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:26.840
I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here. . .

02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:30.280
. . .you would've had
a wonderful success.

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:32.200
You belong here.

02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.680
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:41.680
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: fantasy.

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:45.040
You write a proper part for me. . .

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.600
. . .a couple of catchy songs. . .

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.160
. . .I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:56.920
-What do you say?
-How much will you pay him?

02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.440
Well! I see you brought
your manager with you.

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:06.440
Well, madame. . .

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:09.840
. . .how about half the receipts?

02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:11.840
Half the receipts!

02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:14.320
-Stanzi!
-I'm talking about now.

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:18.000
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.

02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:20.200
Down payment?

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:24.840
Who do you think I am, the emperor?

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:27.400
I have to go.

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:30.680
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:33.640
You won't do this.

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:36.240
-Why not? Half the house!
-When?

02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.480
We need money now! He pays
you now, or you don't do it.

02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:42.320
I don't trust that man.

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.120
I don't like what he did
with your opera. It was common.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:49.360
You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.120
Half the house.

02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.400
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.280
-I'll put it here in your hand.
-Shut up!

02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.400
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money!

02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:09.240
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of
anyone who can do something for him?

02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:13.880
I'm afraid Mozart
is a lost cause, baron.

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:18.720
He has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of Vienna.

02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:20.800
He never pays his debts.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.080
I can 't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.480
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.960
What can I do for you?

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:38.760
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.120
Your pupil is married
and living in Mannheim, young man.

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.480
Really?

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:58.560
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.360
What is it, Mozart?

02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:04.240
What's the matter with you?

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.000
Well. . .

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.000
. . .since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services. . .

02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.000
. . .could you favor me
with a little money instead?

02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:19.400
What for?

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.200
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:31.680
That's hardly the way to go about it.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.920
You are right, sir. You are right.

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.640
But you see, I am endowed
with talent, and you with money.

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.720
If I offer mine. . .

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.640
. . .you should offer yours.

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.960
I'm sorry, no.

02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:55.400
Please.

02:14:57.320 --> 02:14:59.880
My answer is no, Mozart.

02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.000
Please.

02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.400
Please!

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.440
Don't answer it.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.920
Why?

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.880
Tell him. . . .

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.240
Tell him I'm not here.

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:06.520
Tell him. . . .

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:10.120
Tell him I'm working on it.

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.240
Come back later.

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:32.280
-Am I interrupting something?
-No.

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.280
Good. Where's our friend?

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:37.560
He's not here.

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:41.520
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:44.480
Is that it?

02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.760
Is he happy with it?

02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.880
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:03.280
-You think I'm in the funeral business?
-Leave that alone!

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.880
-Put it down! It's nothing for you!
-I'm sorry.

02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:10.160
What have you got for me?

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.880
Finished?

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.880
-What?
-The vaudeville, what do you think?

02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:21.000
Yes.

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:23.480
-Can I see it?
-No.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.680
Why not?

02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.560
Because there's nothing to see.

02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:39.480
Look. . .

02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:46.280
. . .I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.

02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:52.040
-Well, we can.
-So let me see it. Where is it?

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:54.520
Here.

02:17:55.480 --> 02:18:01.040
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.

02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.000
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.520
-Like a drink?
-Look, you little cunt!

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:13.280
Do you know how many
people I've hired?

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:16.080
-Leave him alone!
-I'm paying them!

02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.600
-He's doing his best.
-Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:24.280
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.720
Only an idiot would ask him
to work on that!

02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:30.480
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:33.560
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:36.680
Money. Money.

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.280
You're mad.

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:43.480
She's mad.

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.080
-Oh, yes?
-Wolfie, write it down.

02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.160
Just write it down.

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.480
On paper.

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:55.880
It's no use to anybody in your head.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.280
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:07.000
-I won't work there anymore.
-What happened?

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:11.160
You don't know what it's like.

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.280
Herr Mozart frightens me.

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.480
He drinks all day. . .

02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:20.280
. . .then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.080
Is he working?

02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:26.960
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:32.080
-When he speaks, he makes no sense.
-Is he working?

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.200
I suppose so.

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:41.280
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:44.880
-Opera?
-Don't ask me to go back again.

02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.280
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:51.680
Are you sure it's an opera?

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:37.760
I don't have it yet.

02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:41.480
Are you neglecting my request?

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:45.280
No. No, I. . . .

02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.280
I promise you. . .

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:52.560
. . .I'll give you a wonderful piece,
the best I ever--

02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:59.720
This is my wife, Stanzi.

02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:03.880
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.120
Yes, sir. He's all right.

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:09.480
And he's working on it very hard.

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:14.280
Give me two more weeks. Please.

02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:18.920
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward.

02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:21.200
Work.

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.600
Wolfie.

02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:37.040
I think you really are going mad.

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:43.120
You slave for that idiot actor
who won't give you a penny!

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:46.120
And here,
this is not a ghost!

02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:50.280
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:55.280
Why on earth won't you finish it?

02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:00.160
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:04.280
It's killing me.

02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:10.520
You're drunk, aren't you?

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.760
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:21.280
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.

02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:25.160
I do everything I can to help you.

02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:29.800
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:32.480
Go back to bed!

02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:43.280
Please.

02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:48.280
Let me. . . .
Let me sit here.

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:53.280
Let me stay here with you.

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.800
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:34.000
"Leave! " I said. "Right away.
Take the child with you!

02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:38.680
Go to the spa and get
your health back. " I was shocked.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.680
Shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.280
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:48.960
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:51.880
You and your music. I warned her.

02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:54.920
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.

02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:00.200
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in. " You selfish thing!

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.280
Selfish, that's what you are.
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:49.720
Pick him up.

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.680
Pick him up!

02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:56.120
Be careful. Come with me.

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:58.160
You, follow me.

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:29.280
-Is it over?
-Yes, it's over. It's over.

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.280
Go!

02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:16.000
Go, go. go.

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:18.920
Go! Go!

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:49.720
Where is your wife?

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.280
Where is your wife?

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:01.880
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:05.520
You are so good to me.

02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:09.080
Truly. Thank you.

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:11.280
Please!

02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:16.160
No, I mean to come to my opera.

02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:21.280
You. You are the only colleague
of mine who came.

02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:26.280
Mozart.

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:31.080
I would never miss anything
you had written.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:35.080
-It's just a vaudeville.
-No, no!

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.280
It's a sublime piece.

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:40.560
The grandest operone!

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:51.480
I tell you. . .

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.960
. . .you are the greatest composer
known to me.

02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:01.280
Do you mean it?

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:09.160
-It's him!
-Who?

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:11.480
The man.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.760
He's here.

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:18.800
Tell him to go away.

02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:23.280
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:26.280
No, no. Wait!

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.680
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.

02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:34.280
Tell him if he would,
it will help me to finish it.

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.680
-Salieri?
-Yes.

02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:01.480
-Can we come in?
-Better not. He's sleeping.

02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:06.160
-He's all right, though?
-Yes, he's just exhausted.

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.480
He became dizzy, that's all.

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:14.200
-Well, tell him we came by, won't you?
-Of course.

02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:17.920
Give him this. That's his share.

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.480
-That should cheer him up.
-Indeed!

02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:25.080
And now, good night to you all.
It was. . .

02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:27.160
. . .perfection, truly.

02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:28.920
Thank you.

02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.280
What happened?

02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:52.280
He said to give you this.

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.560
And if you finish by tomorrow night. . .

02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:00.520
. . .he will pay you
another hundred ducats.

02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.680
Another. . .?

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:06.560
That's too soon. Tomorrow night. . . .

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:10.280
It's impossible.

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:16.720
-Did he say a hundred?
-Yes.

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280
It's too soon.

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:28.280
Can I. . .?

02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:30.720
Could I help you?

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.120
Would you?

02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:50.560
-I want to go.
-Where?

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:54.120
-I want to go back to Vienna.
-Now?

02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.920
-Yes.
-Why?

02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.080
I feel wrong.

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.120
I feel wrong being here.

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:10.600
-Where did I stop?
-The end of the Recordare.

02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:12.480
So now Confutatis....

02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:21.720
How would you translate that?

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.760
"Consigned to flames of woe. "

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.680
-Do you believe in it?
-What?

02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:35.000
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:37.560
Oh, yes.

02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:40.920
Possible.

02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:46.480
-Come, let's begin.
-We ended in F major.

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:50.040
-Yes.
-So, now, A minor.

02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:00.880
-A minor.
-Yes.

02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.680
Confutatis. A minor.

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:10.920
Start with the voices.

02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:14.280
-Basses first. Second beat of the--
-Time?

02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:18.200
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.520
On A.

02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:25.680
Second measure, second beat.

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:27.680
You see?

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.680
-Yes. G-sharp?
-Of course.

02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:33.160
Second beat
of the third measure, on E.

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.480
Do you have me? Show me.

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:04.800
Good. Good.

02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:06.600
Now the tenors.

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.080
Fourth beat
of the first measure, on C.

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.560
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:20.160
-All right?
-Yes, continue.

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.680
Second beat
of the fourth measure, on F.

02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.480
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,
bass trombones, basses.

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:37.160
Identical notes and rhythm.

02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.480
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.160
-You go too fast.
-Do you have it?

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.560
-Bassoon to trombone what?
-With the tenors.

02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:00.200
-Identical?
-The instruments doubling the voices.

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.080
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.

02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:06.760
-I don't understand!
-Listen!

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:11.280
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,
first and third beats.

02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:14.480
It goes with the harmony!

02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.280
Yes. Yes, yes!

02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:34.760
I understand. And that's all?

02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:38.280
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:41.280
Ostinato, on A. Like this:

02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:46.120
Next measure is rising.

02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:50.280
Do you have it? Show me.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:01.040
-It's wonderful!
-Yes, yes. Go on.

02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.720
-Write that down!
-Yes, yes.

02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:16.680
"Call me among the blessed. "

02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:18.680
C major.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.560
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.080
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:45.000
And on dictus. And underneath,
just violins. Arpeggios.

02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:48.920
Scale in eighth notes,
then back to ostinato.

02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.280
-Do you have it?
-You go too fast.

02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:54.720
-Do you have it?
-One moment, please!

02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.520
Good. Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:08.280
Do you want to rest a bit?

02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:10.880
No, I'm not tired at all.

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:19.520
We'll stop for a moment.

02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.760
-Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
-I can keep going. I assure you.

02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:28.520
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:32.280
I'm not leaving you.

02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:42.080
I'm so ashamed.

02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:45.280
Of what?

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.280
I was foolish.

02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:53.120
I thought you did not care
for my work, or me.

02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:58.760
Forgive me.

02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:05.480
Forgive me.

02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.680
What are you doing here?

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.120
Your husband took sick.

02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:14.280
I brought him home.

02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.800
Why you?

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:22.160
Because, madame, I was at hand.

02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:29.280
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:33.880
He needs me, ma'am.

02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:36.040
No, he doesn't.

02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.280
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.

02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:44.040
-He asked me to stay.
-And I'm ask--

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:16.080
I'm back.

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:22.120
I missed you so much.

02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:27.720
If you'd just. . .

02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:32.120
. . .show me that you need me.

02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:41.280
And I'll try to do better too.

02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:54.880
What is this?

02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.480
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.880
You're not to work on this ever again.

02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:12.760
I've decided.

02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:19.280
This is not his handwriting.

02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:22.800
It's mine.

02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:26.120
I was assisting him.

02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.200
He's not to work on this anymore.

02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:32.680
-It's making him ill.
-But--

02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:37.600
Good night.

02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:44.680
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:47.800
Please respect my wish and go.

02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:49.880
Madame. . .

02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.600
. . .I will respect his.

02:52:57.120 --> 02:52:59.920
Your merciful God.

02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:08.480
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity. . .

02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:12.680
. . .share in the smallest part
of his glory.

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:15.760
He killed Mozart.

02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:19.560
And kept me alive to torture.

02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:21.920
Thirty-two years of torture.

02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:27.760
Thirty-two years of slowly
watching myself become extinct.

02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:30.280
My music. . .

02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:32.280
. . .growing fainter.

02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:35.480
All the time fainter. . .

02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:38.520
. . .till no one plays it at all.

02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:40.720
And his. . . .

02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:47.280
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:52.520
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:55.880
Fresh sugar rolls.

02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:58.480
I will speak for you, Father.

02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:01.920
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:05.080
I am their champion.

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:08.040
I am their patron saint.

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:21.280
Mediocrities everywhere. . .

02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:25.280
. . .I absolve you.

02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:28.560
I absolve you.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.280
I absolve you.

02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:37.280
I absolve you.

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:41.080
I absolve you all.
