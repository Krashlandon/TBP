WEBVTT

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.750
(theme music punctuated by gunshots)

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:41.111
(dog howls)

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.836
(door bangs in the wind)

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.310
(gunfire)

00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:37.318
You're from Baker?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.581
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:54.794
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

00:10:54.877 --> 00:10:57.797
I know nothing about that case of coins.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.260
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

00:11:03.344 --> 00:11:06.972
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:09.308
They couldn't uncover any more.

00:11:09.392 --> 00:11:12.269
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

00:11:12.353 --> 00:11:15.815
Go back and tell him that.

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:20.611
Word's around you had a visitor.

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:23.322
And Baker knows it.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.243
Name of Jackson.

00:11:29.912 --> 00:11:31.455
Well?

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:33.999
Jackson was here.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:38.587
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:47.722
He's not wrong.

00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:52.560
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:55.771
about the cash box.

00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:01.694
That's not what I'm being paid for.

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:09.827
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:15.166
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:18.210
I would have found him already.

00:12:18.294 --> 00:12:21.672
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:24.842
That's why they pay me.

00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:31.515
What is Baker paying you?

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.938
That your family?

00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:47.656
Yes.

00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:51.243
Nice family.

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:55.539
What does he pay you for murdering me?

00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:02.296
500 dollars, to get the name.

00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:10.638
The name.

00:13:19.563 --> 00:13:22.274
Carson... Bill Carson.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.903
That's what he calls himself now.

00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:58.811
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

00:14:02.773 --> 00:14:05.275
A thousand dollars?

00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:11.281
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:17.287
But when I'm paid...

00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:20.499
I always see the job through.

00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:24.688
(snoring)

00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:35.657
It's you. Any information?

00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:40.621
Too much.

00:15:40.704 --> 00:15:43.665
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:46.460
And one or two things that interested me.

00:15:46.543 --> 00:15:48.712
Such as?

00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:52.716
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

00:15:55.594 --> 00:15:58.597
That's your bit.

00:15:59.848 --> 00:16:01.934
Keep talking.

00:16:02.017 --> 00:16:05.896
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:08.941
which just happened to disappear.

00:16:09.024 --> 00:16:10.943
That's my bit.

00:16:11.026 --> 00:16:13.153
Anything else?

00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:15.489
Not enough for you, eh?

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:19.660
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

00:16:20.244 --> 00:16:22.454
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.749
Here... Here you are.

00:16:25.832 --> 00:16:29.294
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

00:16:29.378 --> 00:16:31.880
Worth 500 dollars.

00:16:31.964 --> 00:16:34.091
(coughs weakly)

00:16:34.174 --> 00:16:37.386
Yeah. I almost forgot.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:39.930
He gave me a thousand.

00:16:40.013 --> 00:16:43.183
I think his idea
was that I kill you. (chuckles)

00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:55.153
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:57.030
You know that.

00:16:57.114 --> 00:16:59.908
No! Angel Eyes!

00:17:19.928 --> 00:17:21.763
(chuckles)

00:17:30.063 --> 00:17:32.315
(gun cocking)

00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:46.204
No. No pistol, amigo.

00:17:46.288 --> 00:17:50.459
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:06.308
Hey, amigo...

00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:11.646
You know you got a face beautiful enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.523
(laughter)

00:18:13.607 --> 00:18:16.485
(new voice) Yeah...

00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:20.739
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

00:18:27.204 --> 00:18:29.915
A couple of steps back.

00:19:23.718 --> 00:19:25.804
Thank you.

00:19:34.562 --> 00:19:36.898
How much are you worth now?

00:19:36.982 --> 00:19:38.984
How much?

00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:41.903
2,000 dollars.

00:19:43.571 --> 00:19:46.074
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:48.868
2,000 dollars. (chuckles)

00:19:54.499 --> 00:19:58.628
!Hijo de puta que te parió!
You'll pay for this!

00:19:58.712 --> 00:20:01.214
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

00:20:01.298 --> 00:20:04.301
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:09.264
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

00:20:09.347 --> 00:20:12.309
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

00:20:12.392 --> 00:20:14.811
Cut me loose!

00:20:15.854 --> 00:20:20.817
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.986
Let me go.

00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:27.824
I feel sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

00:20:27.907 --> 00:20:32.829
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

00:20:33.872 --> 00:20:36.624
(dirty laugh)

00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:40.128
You swine!

00:20:40.211 --> 00:20:43.673
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

00:20:43.757 --> 00:20:47.302
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:50.138
Come back and fight.

00:20:50.221 --> 00:20:52.098
You bastard.

00:20:53.058 --> 00:20:56.936
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.690
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

00:21:00.774 --> 00:21:03.068
I'm innocent of everything.

00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:06.905
So you're an honest farmer?

00:21:06.988 --> 00:21:09.532
You recognise this man?

00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:12.494
Yeah, it's you.

00:21:12.577 --> 00:21:16.581
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

00:21:16.664 --> 00:21:20.960
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

00:21:21.044 --> 00:21:24.589
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

00:21:24.672 --> 00:21:28.092
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:33.556
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.727
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:39.687
You know who you are?

00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:42.148
Want to know whose son you are?

00:21:42.232 --> 00:21:44.692
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:48.321
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

00:21:48.404 --> 00:21:51.199
And your mother, she's...

00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:53.660
You bastard!

00:21:53.743 --> 00:21:58.373
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

00:21:58.456 --> 00:22:04.546
Wanted in 1 4 counties of this state,
the condemned is found guilty

00:22:04.629 --> 00:22:11.719
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery
of citizens, state banks and post offices,

00:22:11.803 --> 00:22:15.723
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

00:22:15.807 --> 00:22:20.603
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:23.189
inciting prostitution, kidnapping,

00:22:23.273 --> 00:22:27.777
extortion, receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.949
passing counterfeit money, and,
contrary to the laws of this state,

00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:37.495
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards...

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:41.666
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

00:22:41.749 --> 00:22:44.752
we sentence the accused here before us,

00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:48.631
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez...

00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:51.843
Known as "The Rat".

00:22:53.594 --> 00:22:55.680
..to hang by the neck until dead.

00:22:55.763 --> 00:22:59.309
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

00:23:25.335 --> 00:23:27.378
Five for you.

00:23:27.462 --> 00:23:31.632
One, two, three, four... five for me.

00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:38.181
Five for you and five for me.

00:23:38.264 --> 00:23:40.600
Know how much you're worth now?

00:23:40.683 --> 00:23:44.145
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:47.065
(gratified grunt)

00:23:47.982 --> 00:23:50.902
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

00:23:50.985 --> 00:23:55.490
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

00:23:55.573 --> 00:24:00.453
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

00:24:00.536 --> 00:24:04.248
So the next time I want more than half.

00:24:04.332 --> 00:24:08.961
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

00:24:10.004 --> 00:24:14.258
If we cut down my percentage...

00:24:14.342 --> 00:24:16.594
Cigar?

00:24:17.637 --> 00:24:20.056
..Iiable to interfere with my aim.

00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:26.187
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.274
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

00:24:30.358 --> 00:24:34.320
he understands nothing about Tuco.

00:24:34.403 --> 00:24:36.489
Nothing.

00:24:39.617 --> 00:24:41.786
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

00:24:41.869 --> 00:24:45.581
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:49.126
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.214
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

00:24:53.297 --> 00:24:58.302
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:01.764
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:03.432
derailing a train...

00:25:03.516 --> 00:25:06.143
Hey, Angel Eyes.

00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:15.653
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

00:25:15.736 --> 00:25:19.949
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

00:25:20.032 --> 00:25:24.954
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:27.582
What wasn't saved was the coins.

00:25:27.665 --> 00:25:31.627
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:34.547
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.801
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

00:25:38.884 --> 00:25:43.681
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:46.559
Where is Carson?

00:25:46.642 --> 00:25:49.854
All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

00:25:49.937 --> 00:25:54.275
He lives with a girl called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

00:25:54.358 --> 00:25:57.612
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

00:25:57.695 --> 00:25:59.488
Someplace fairly near.

00:26:01.907 --> 00:26:03.326
Santa Ana.

00:26:06.454 --> 00:26:09.582
Adios, half-soldier.

00:26:13.127 --> 00:26:15.212
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

00:26:15.296 --> 00:26:17.548
..and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:20.718
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

00:26:20.801 --> 00:26:23.054
and, after receiving payment in advance,

00:26:23.137 --> 00:26:26.599
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

00:26:26.682 --> 00:26:30.519
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

00:26:30.603 --> 00:26:35.191
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:39.362
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:50.206
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:54.126
(judge) For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.755
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

00:26:57.838 --> 00:27:00.716
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

00:27:16.232 --> 00:27:19.360
Let's get the hell out of here!

00:27:49.807 --> 00:27:52.685
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

00:27:52.768 --> 00:27:54.812
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

00:27:54.895 --> 00:27:58.274
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

00:27:58.357 --> 00:28:03.654
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

00:28:05.573 --> 00:28:07.741
Yeah. You're right.

00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:10.494
It's getting tougher.

00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:17.167
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:18.544
What do you mean?

00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:22.548
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

00:28:23.382 --> 00:28:25.593
What do you mean?

00:28:25.676 --> 00:28:28.512
I mean our partnership is untied.

00:28:29.597 --> 00:28:31.599
Oh, no, not you.

00:28:31.682 --> 00:28:33.475
You remain tied.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:36.562
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:40.774
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

00:28:40.858 --> 00:28:43.861
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

00:28:44.945 --> 00:28:48.157
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

00:28:48.782 --> 00:28:49.992
Adios.

00:28:50.075 --> 00:28:53.287
You filthy bastard! Come here!

00:28:53.704 --> 00:28:58.751
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

00:28:58.834 --> 00:29:02.087
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

00:29:02.171 --> 00:29:07.176
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:09.803
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

00:29:09.887 --> 00:29:11.764
(tsks)

00:29:11.847 --> 00:29:16.226
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:23.901
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

00:29:23.984 --> 00:29:26.945
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:30.866
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

00:29:30.949 --> 00:29:34.370
!Hijo de una gran puta!

00:29:34.453 --> 00:29:37.539
(echoes into theme music)

00:29:43.962 --> 00:29:46.924
(drunken singing)

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.098
(laughter)

00:29:55.057 --> 00:29:58.268
I believe madam is home.

00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:00.437
Sweet dreams.

00:30:11.323 --> 00:30:14.034
You filthy rats!

00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:31.969
(man, quietly) Maria?

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:41.145
Is that you, Bill?

00:30:41.228 --> 00:30:43.147
Bill!

00:30:44.314 --> 00:30:46.108
Arh!

00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:54.158
Who are you?

00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:56.201
What do you want with me?

00:30:56.285 --> 00:30:59.621
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

00:30:59.705 --> 00:31:02.416
I don't know him.

00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:05.752
You were calling to him in the dark.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.716
Where is he?

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:13.135
What are you gonna do to him?

00:31:14.511 --> 00:31:16.722
I'll ask the questions.

00:31:18.515 --> 00:31:20.934
Where is he?

00:31:27.691 --> 00:31:29.568
Where is he? Where?

00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:32.362
Where? Where?

00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:34.740
Where?

00:31:37.534 --> 00:31:39.620
That's enough.

00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:44.166
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

00:31:44.249 --> 00:31:47.586
and went away with his unit. They all left.

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:49.838
Which company? Where did they go?

00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:53.884
Hm?

00:31:53.967 --> 00:31:58.889
3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

00:31:59.973 --> 00:32:03.185
That's all I know. I swear.

00:32:56.738 --> 00:32:59.032
(pained gasp)

00:33:28.603 --> 00:33:30.689
But... but...

00:33:34.818 --> 00:33:37.529
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

00:33:37.612 --> 00:33:39.281
Mm-hm.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.045
(chuckles)

00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:19.613
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

00:34:23.241 --> 00:34:25.118
Revolvers.

00:34:25.202 --> 00:34:29.456
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:36.880
Here, Remington, Colt,

00:34:36.963 --> 00:34:39.758
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:44.137
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.431
another Remington, and this one...

00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:47.974
That's enough.

00:35:31.309 --> 00:35:33.645
Cartridges.

00:35:41.444 --> 00:35:45.699
- You wanna try the pistol, step out back.
- Let's go.

00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:52.831
Move, move.

00:36:41.171 --> 00:36:43.715
(chuckles)

00:37:07.655 --> 00:37:09.741
Cartridge.

00:37:17.624 --> 00:37:20.752
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:24.839
(chuckles) No.

00:37:27.508 --> 00:37:30.595
Fifty dollars.

00:37:30.678 --> 00:37:35.141
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

00:37:37.268 --> 00:37:41.356
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

00:37:41.439 --> 00:37:43.524
Here.

00:38:02.502 --> 00:38:05.004
Come here.

00:38:11.094 --> 00:38:12.762
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:18.518
- (chuckles) Heh?
- Mm-hm.

00:38:23.106 --> 00:38:28.319
(Tuco) If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:11.946
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:40.475
Potatoes.

00:39:41.184 --> 00:39:44.479
You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.

00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:47.523
Really poor.

00:39:47.607 --> 00:39:51.152
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

00:39:53.404 --> 00:39:56.282
The world is divided into two parts:

00:39:56.365 --> 00:40:02.371
those who have friends,
and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

00:40:03.998 --> 00:40:08.878
You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.

00:40:09.795 --> 00:40:13.382
Chico and Ramón, his two brothers,
were my friends too.

00:40:16.844 --> 00:40:20.139
But who knows where they are now?

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.685
Ah, it's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:27.063
I had a good deal for you.

00:40:29.315 --> 00:40:33.277
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got 4,000 dollars.

00:40:34.195 --> 00:40:39.700
4,000 dollars.
And I know where to find it.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:47.500
If they would help me catch him,
I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.

00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:51.295
1 ,000 dollars each. Hm?

00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:11.607
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

00:41:14.402 --> 00:41:16.946
And rich. Like you're going to be.

00:41:17.029 --> 00:41:19.949
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

00:41:20.032 --> 00:41:22.285
And people talk bullshit.

00:41:25.997 --> 00:41:29.333
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:32.753
And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.

00:41:32.837 --> 00:41:34.922
Vamos.

00:41:51.105 --> 00:41:53.232
This morning I heard the whole thing.

00:41:53.315 --> 00:41:58.487
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

00:41:58.571 --> 00:42:01.282
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

00:42:01.365 --> 00:42:04.827
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.789
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

00:42:08.873 --> 00:42:14.170
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

00:42:14.253 --> 00:42:16.630
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

00:42:16.714 --> 00:42:19.592
And they're going to beat the South.

00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:24.889
Look. See that one with the white beard,
General Sibley? He looks dead.

00:42:24.972 --> 00:42:26.974
He's finally getting out of our hair.

00:42:27.057 --> 00:42:31.937
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

00:42:35.649 --> 00:42:38.736
Where's the owner of that horse?

00:42:38.819 --> 00:42:41.989
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:47.077
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

00:42:47.161 --> 00:42:52.249
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:55.211
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

00:42:55.294 --> 00:42:58.881
You stay quiet, old hen.

00:42:58.964 --> 00:43:03.135
Upstairs in room four, señor.

00:43:08.224 --> 00:43:10.518
Hear that?

00:43:15.147 --> 00:43:19.151
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

00:43:21.529 --> 00:43:24.448
(rumble of wagons outside)

00:45:23.358 --> 00:45:25.444
(chink of spurs)

00:45:31.075 --> 00:45:33.660
(distant cannon fire)

00:46:32.803 --> 00:46:35.389
Your spurs.

00:46:43.438 --> 00:46:45.524
(Tuco chuckles)

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.406
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

00:46:52.489 --> 00:46:57.953
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

00:46:58.036 --> 00:47:01.164
Take off that pistol belt.

00:47:07.629 --> 00:47:09.089
It's empty.

00:47:11.717 --> 00:47:15.012
- Mine isn't.
- (closer cannon fire)

00:47:19.975 --> 00:47:23.770
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

00:47:27.107 --> 00:47:29.484
That could be cannon fire.

00:47:29.568 --> 00:47:34.114
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

00:47:35.615 --> 00:47:39.536
You ever see this before, my friend?

00:47:47.502 --> 00:47:51.173
Throw it over the roof beam.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.300
That's it.

00:48:04.978 --> 00:48:07.064
Now get on that.

00:48:16.907 --> 00:48:18.784
That's right.

00:48:18.867 --> 00:48:21.369
Now make sure the rope is tight.

00:48:21.453 --> 00:48:24.581
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

00:48:30.879 --> 00:48:34.382
Now put the rope around your neck.

00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:43.058
That's very good.

00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:46.978
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

00:48:47.062 --> 00:48:51.316
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

00:48:52.234 --> 00:48:56.446
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stool.

00:49:00.992 --> 00:49:03.078
Adiós.

00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.227
Welcome, my friend.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.814
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

00:52:17.897 --> 00:52:21.401
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

00:52:21.484 --> 00:52:23.361
(laughter)

00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:25.572
And the attractions don't stop there.

00:52:25.655 --> 00:52:29.868
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

00:52:29.951 --> 00:52:32.036
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.622
Our government has spared no expense.

00:52:34.706 --> 00:52:37.584
As you can see, we are treated very well.

00:52:37.667 --> 00:52:41.254
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

00:52:41.337 --> 00:52:46.509
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

00:52:46.593 --> 00:52:50.930
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

00:52:51.014 --> 00:52:54.100
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

00:52:54.183 --> 00:52:57.103
And you ask me if I know someone.

00:52:57.186 --> 00:53:01.357
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

00:53:12.118 --> 00:53:16.289
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the 3rd.

00:53:18.041 --> 00:53:22.086
If he's with the 3rd...
They've already left.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.796
For Glorietta.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.092
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

00:53:28.176 --> 00:53:34.098
And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

00:53:34.182 --> 00:53:36.726
And what if they were still alive?

00:53:39.062 --> 00:53:41.314
Worse.

00:53:41.397 --> 00:53:45.068
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:51.032
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

00:53:51.115 --> 00:53:53.618
Keep it. It's yours.

00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:22.433
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

00:56:22.516 --> 00:56:25.102
guilty of the following crimes:

00:56:25.186 --> 00:56:29.774
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

00:56:44.205 --> 00:56:46.040
And Shorty?

00:56:50.795 --> 00:56:51.962
No.

00:56:53.172 --> 00:56:55.800
No?

00:56:56.092 --> 00:56:59.845
..alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck until dead.

00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:03.224
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.399
Sorry, Shorty.

00:57:12.817 --> 00:57:15.528
Move. Come on, let's go.

00:57:40.136 --> 00:57:43.180
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

00:57:43.264 --> 00:57:49.145
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

00:58:12.501 --> 00:58:16.338
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

00:58:17.339 --> 00:58:19.717
Where are we going?

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.302
Where?

00:58:21.385 --> 00:58:23.846
Where I'm going, amigo.

00:58:23.929 --> 00:58:25.723
Over that way.

00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:29.643
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

00:58:29.727 --> 00:58:32.396
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

00:58:32.479 --> 00:58:35.065
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

00:58:35.149 --> 00:58:38.319
Canby's men are coming here.

00:58:38.402 --> 00:58:42.364
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

00:58:42.448 --> 00:58:45.159
Except you and me.

00:58:46.327 --> 00:58:49.705
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

00:58:52.249 --> 00:58:55.711
What was it you told me the last time?

00:58:56.962 --> 00:59:01.759
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

00:59:02.927 --> 00:59:07.389
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

00:59:08.599 --> 00:59:12.102
Very slowly, old friend.

00:59:16.148 --> 00:59:17.942
After you, please.

00:59:18.025 --> 00:59:20.110
Start walking.

01:01:04.423 --> 01:01:06.508
(Tuco laughs)

01:01:15.684 --> 01:01:18.020
Taking a rest?

01:01:18.479 --> 01:01:22.858
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:27.905
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

01:01:27.988 --> 01:01:30.532
That's not too bad.

01:01:31.575 --> 01:01:32.910
Come on.

01:02:09.988 --> 01:02:12.491
(chuckles heartily)

01:02:16.912 --> 01:02:18.789
Whoa...

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.022
OK, let's eat.

01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:29.860
That is, I'll eat.

01:03:31.611 --> 01:03:35.866
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.334
You want some water?

01:03:50.088 --> 01:03:51.840
Drink.

01:03:57.846 --> 01:04:00.056
Come on.

01:04:41.056 --> 01:04:44.434
Well, Blondie... So long.

01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:54.129
And so, Blondie...

01:05:55.755 --> 01:05:58.258
it's goodbye.

01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:01.261
(rumble of hooves)

01:06:54.105 --> 01:06:56.357
Whoa, whoa...

01:07:01.154 --> 01:07:02.781
Easy, easy.

01:07:02.864 --> 01:07:05.617
Easy. Attaboy.

01:09:23.546 --> 01:09:25.882
(creaking)

01:09:34.599 --> 01:09:36.684
Water...

01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:49.030
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:54.911
What's that you say?

01:09:54.994 --> 01:09:58.748
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

01:09:58.831 --> 01:10:02.251
My name is Bill Carson now.

01:10:02.335 --> 01:10:05.088
Surprise attack...

01:10:05.171 --> 01:10:09.717
AII dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:13.221
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

01:10:13.304 --> 01:10:19.018
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

01:10:19.101 --> 01:10:22.104
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:25.066
Baker has nothing.

01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:28.945
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

01:10:30.154 --> 01:10:33.074
Where? Here?

01:10:33.157 --> 01:10:37.245
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

01:10:37.328 --> 01:10:39.038
Which cemetery?

01:10:39.121 --> 01:10:42.792
The one on Sad Hill.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:45.127
There's a grave...

01:10:45.211 --> 01:10:48.256
Which grave? Have a name?

01:10:48.339 --> 01:10:53.135
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:56.264
There's... no number.

01:10:56.347 --> 01:10:58.891
There's a name.

01:10:58.975 --> 01:11:01.477
It's written...

01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.648
(croaks)

01:11:07.858 --> 01:11:10.778
- Water...
- (frustrated grunt)

01:11:11.821 --> 01:11:14.699
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

01:11:14.782 --> 01:11:17.910
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

01:11:17.994 --> 01:11:24.083
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1 ,000... 5,000...

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:31.632
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

01:11:31.716 --> 01:11:35.428
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

01:11:35.511 --> 01:11:38.472
Don't die until later, you son of a...

01:11:59.035 --> 01:12:01.495
(yells)

01:12:03.539 --> 01:12:06.667
Get away from there.

01:12:11.213 --> 01:12:13.382
He's dead.

01:12:16.677 --> 01:12:19.180
I'll kill you.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.061
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

01:12:25.144 --> 01:12:28.272
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:33.069
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

01:12:33.152 --> 01:12:36.280
What did he tell you?

01:12:36.364 --> 01:12:38.741
A name.

01:12:38.824 --> 01:12:43.120
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

01:12:56.509 --> 01:12:58.594
Blondie... Don't die.

01:12:58.677 --> 01:13:00.763
Blondie, don't die.

01:13:00.846 --> 01:13:03.557
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

01:13:03.641 --> 01:13:06.185
I'm your friend. Come on.

01:13:06.268 --> 01:13:07.853
Come on, eh?

01:13:07.937 --> 01:13:11.398
Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.

01:13:11.482 --> 01:13:14.443
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

01:13:14.527 --> 01:13:18.405
Don't die like that pig.

01:13:18.489 --> 01:13:20.574
Here's water, Blondie.

01:13:20.658 --> 01:13:24.286
Don't drink, it's no good for you.
Feel better?

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:28.582
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die.

01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:40.302
(Tuco) Hey, open up! Hurry!

01:13:40.386 --> 01:13:43.514
Settle down. Who's there?

01:13:44.849 --> 01:13:49.228
What do you mean, "who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

01:13:51.438 --> 01:13:55.401
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

01:13:55.484 --> 01:13:56.735
Come on.

01:13:56.819 --> 01:14:00.364
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

01:14:00.447 --> 01:14:06.287
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

01:14:07.705 --> 01:14:11.750
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:13.878
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:18.799
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and travelling papers.

01:14:19.925 --> 01:14:23.971
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:27.766
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

01:14:32.396 --> 01:14:34.857
Are you reading when this man is dying?

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.736
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

01:14:38.819 --> 01:14:42.948
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

01:14:43.616 --> 01:14:47.202
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

01:14:48.537 --> 01:14:50.998
Apache Canyon?

01:14:51.081 --> 01:14:53.584
Is a mission San Antonio around here?

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.836
18 miles south. Take him there.

01:14:55.919 --> 01:14:59.590
The brothers take care of any wounded,
whatever the colour of his uniform.

01:14:59.673 --> 01:15:02.676
And keep your eyes open -
the area is full of Yankees.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.345
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

01:15:04.428 --> 01:15:06.430
Take care.

01:15:25.115 --> 01:15:27.201
Whoa!

01:15:30.245 --> 01:15:33.499
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

01:15:33.582 --> 01:15:36.085
Let him have yours.

01:15:41.006 --> 01:15:45.135
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

01:15:45.219 --> 01:15:47.638
He should be back any day now.

01:15:47.721 --> 01:15:51.892
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

01:15:51.975 --> 01:15:53.811
And may God be praised.

01:15:53.894 --> 01:15:59.483
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

01:16:00.859 --> 01:16:04.822
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

01:16:04.905 --> 01:16:06.990
You're heavy.

01:16:17.793 --> 01:16:19.878
There.

01:16:48.615 --> 01:16:51.743
AII right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

01:16:52.703 --> 01:16:55.497
Put him in my cell.

01:16:55.581 --> 01:16:57.666
Easy.

01:17:00.043 --> 01:17:02.379
Out, soldier. Out you go.

01:17:02.462 --> 01:17:06.300
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

01:17:10.929 --> 01:17:12.931
Hey, Father, l...

01:17:20.397 --> 01:17:22.566
(mutters)

01:17:25.694 --> 01:17:29.448
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

01:17:58.352 --> 01:18:01.313
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

01:18:01.396 --> 01:18:03.148
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:08.445
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

01:18:08.528 --> 01:18:10.864
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

01:18:10.947 --> 01:18:13.659
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

01:18:13.742 --> 01:18:16.370
Thanks be to Jesus.

01:19:05.168 --> 01:19:06.461
Blondie?

01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:15.137
Hey, Blondie?

01:19:33.321 --> 01:19:37.701
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

01:19:37.784 --> 01:19:41.621
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

01:19:41.705 --> 01:19:45.292
Think if you'd been on your own.

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:50.755
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

01:19:50.839 --> 01:19:56.052
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

01:19:56.136 --> 01:20:01.808
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:04.811
Not even a mother.

01:20:05.353 --> 01:20:07.439
No-one?

01:20:07.522 --> 01:20:10.984
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

01:20:11.067 --> 01:20:13.820
We're all alone in the world.

01:20:13.904 --> 01:20:17.032
I have you, you have me.

01:20:18.742 --> 01:20:21.244
Only for a little while, I mean.

01:20:21.328 --> 01:20:26.583
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

01:20:26.666 --> 01:20:30.712
We could have all that money
in our hands.

01:20:34.799 --> 01:20:41.306
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

01:20:42.974 --> 01:20:46.186
It's all over for you now.

01:20:46.269 --> 01:20:50.148
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

01:20:51.566 --> 01:20:53.526
Oh, God, forgive me.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:56.738
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:09.876
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:13.588
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

01:21:13.672 --> 01:21:17.926
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

01:21:18.009 --> 01:21:21.554
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

01:21:21.638 --> 01:21:23.973
I would tell the name on the grave.

01:21:24.057 --> 01:21:28.645
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

01:21:28.728 --> 01:21:31.940
But you know how many graves
there are there?

01:21:32.023 --> 01:21:37.904
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

01:21:40.865 --> 01:21:44.244
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

01:21:44.327 --> 01:21:46.913
On... on the grave.

01:21:48.289 --> 01:21:52.752
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

01:21:52.836 --> 01:21:55.839
I'll always honour your memory.

01:21:55.922 --> 01:22:00.218
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:04.139
Come closer.

01:22:09.018 --> 01:22:11.104
Tell me.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.941
You dirty...

01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:19.237
I'll sleep better...

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.783
knowing my good friend is by my side...

01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:26.244
to protect me.

01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:37.338
"Tuco, water." Well, here's water.

01:22:37.422 --> 01:22:42.093
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

01:22:48.141 --> 01:22:50.977
AII right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.856
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

01:22:54.939 --> 01:23:00.320
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

01:23:00.403 --> 01:23:03.448
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

01:23:03.531 --> 01:23:08.411
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

01:23:08.494 --> 01:23:11.080
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.974
Hey, Pablo?

01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:39.275
Don't you recognise me?

01:23:40.818 --> 01:23:43.321
It's me. Tuco.

01:23:43.404 --> 01:23:46.532
Let me embrace you...

01:23:48.534 --> 01:23:51.746
I don't know the right thing.

01:23:55.917 --> 01:24:02.173
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

01:24:04.717 --> 01:24:07.053
Did I do wrong?

01:24:07.553 --> 01:24:10.056
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

01:24:10.139 --> 01:24:12.392
You have seen me, Tuco.

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:17.271
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.946
Ah, my uniform.

01:24:25.029 --> 01:24:27.115
It's a long story.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.618
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

01:24:30.702 --> 01:24:35.373
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:40.837
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

01:24:41.754 --> 01:24:44.799
Wh... What about our parents?

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:52.140
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

01:24:54.058 --> 01:24:56.936
Nine years?

01:24:57.019 --> 01:24:59.731
So it's nine years.

01:24:59.814 --> 01:25:01.399
Nine years.

01:25:02.066 --> 01:25:04.902
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.868
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

01:25:13.411 --> 01:25:15.913
He asked for you to be there.

01:25:15.997 --> 01:25:19.125
But there was only me.

01:25:25.006 --> 01:25:27.175
And you?

01:25:27.258 --> 01:25:31.471
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

01:25:31.554 --> 01:25:36.392
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:39.729
Not one. Lots of them.

01:25:39.812 --> 01:25:43.608
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

01:25:43.691 --> 01:25:48.112
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

01:25:48.196 --> 01:25:51.532
What good would that be?

01:25:51.616 --> 01:25:54.285
Just keep on the way you're going.

01:25:54.368 --> 01:25:56.787
Go away.

01:25:56.871 --> 01:25:59.457
- The Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go.

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.335
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

01:26:02.418 --> 01:26:07.715
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

01:26:07.798 --> 01:26:10.218
You think you're better than I am.

01:26:10.301 --> 01:26:15.223
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

01:26:15.306 --> 01:26:19.685
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

01:26:19.769 --> 01:26:22.063
You talk of our mother and father -

01:26:22.146 --> 01:26:24.815
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

01:26:24.899 --> 01:26:29.028
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

01:26:29.111 --> 01:26:33.241
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

01:26:33.324 --> 01:26:39.330
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

01:26:56.764 --> 01:26:58.432
Tuco.

01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:11.195
Please forgive me, brother.

01:27:22.456 --> 01:27:24.375
Haa!

01:27:40.224 --> 01:27:44.145
Ah, my belly's full.

01:27:44.228 --> 01:27:46.480
Nice guy, my brother.

01:27:46.564 --> 01:27:49.108
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:53.571
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

01:27:53.654 --> 01:27:58.909
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other."

01:27:58.993 --> 01:28:02.913
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."

01:28:02.997 --> 01:28:07.168
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:11.338
My brother, he's crazy about me.

01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:19.930
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

01:28:20.014 --> 01:28:25.102
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.

01:28:26.645 --> 01:28:29.315
Sure.

01:28:29.398 --> 01:28:34.195
Well, after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

01:29:23.994 --> 01:29:27.164
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

01:29:27.248 --> 01:29:30.459
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

01:29:30.542 --> 01:29:33.587
That sure is a long way.

01:29:33.671 --> 01:29:37.800
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

01:29:37.883 --> 01:29:40.052
- After that...
- Then what?

01:29:42.137 --> 01:29:46.934
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

01:29:48.978 --> 01:29:53.357
Those men aren't worried
about anything any more, are they?

01:29:55.192 --> 01:30:01.448
But since I'm alive and I've noticed
we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,

01:30:01.532 --> 01:30:04.785
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

01:30:04.868 --> 01:30:08.956
Towards 200,000 dollars.
Is that good enough for you?

01:30:17.798 --> 01:30:19.883
Whoa.

01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:22.720
(growls)

01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:30.227
Wake up, you.

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:33.772
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

01:30:40.195 --> 01:30:43.907
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

01:30:43.991 --> 01:30:47.870
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

01:30:47.953 --> 01:30:51.331
Hurrah! Down with General Grant!

01:30:51.415 --> 01:30:53.250
Hurrah for General...

01:30:53.333 --> 01:30:55.044
- What's his name?
- Lee.

01:30:55.127 --> 01:30:56.628
..Lee!

01:30:57.004 --> 01:31:02.092
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

01:31:02.176 --> 01:31:05.929
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

01:31:18.192 --> 01:31:22.279
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

01:31:22.362 --> 01:31:26.074
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

01:31:26.158 --> 01:31:29.411
Prisoners of war, forward...

01:31:30.537 --> 01:31:32.289
march.

01:31:32.372 --> 01:31:35.542
Hup, two, three, four...

01:32:28.679 --> 01:32:31.348
Left face.

01:32:34.184 --> 01:32:38.730
Form a single file. Move.

01:33:08.844 --> 01:33:12.055
(corporal takes prisoner roll call)

01:33:19.604 --> 01:33:22.983
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

01:33:29.114 --> 01:33:31.825
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

01:33:31.908 --> 01:33:35.829
- Nathaniel Sullivan.
- Present.

01:33:36.288 --> 01:33:39.416
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

01:33:40.042 --> 01:33:42.919
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

01:33:46.089 --> 01:33:48.175
Bill Carson.

01:33:50.886 --> 01:33:53.388
Bill Carson?

01:33:53.847 --> 01:33:56.308
I said Bill Carson.

01:33:56.391 --> 01:33:59.186
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:06.068
AII right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

01:34:06.151 --> 01:34:09.029
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

01:34:09.112 --> 01:34:10.781
Bill Carson!

01:34:10.864 --> 01:34:13.992
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.211
Please, Carson...

01:34:25.253 --> 01:34:27.339
answer "present".

01:34:28.715 --> 01:34:31.510
What, are you deaf?

01:34:36.389 --> 01:34:38.892
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

01:34:40.936 --> 01:34:46.024
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

01:34:46.107 --> 01:34:49.194
And sometimes they never get up.

01:34:49.986 --> 01:34:51.446
Wallace.

01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:54.699
That's enough.

01:34:57.577 --> 01:34:58.829
Sergeant.

01:35:00.956 --> 01:35:05.126
The captain wants to see you right away.

01:35:06.878 --> 01:35:10.423
Be sure these two get good treatment.

01:35:19.432 --> 01:35:23.395
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

01:35:25.689 --> 01:35:27.774
Yeah.

01:35:30.235 --> 01:35:33.780
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

01:35:33.863 --> 01:35:37.784
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

01:35:37.867 --> 01:35:40.829
No more brutality.

01:35:40.912 --> 01:35:44.624
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:46.793
I have to have respect.

01:35:46.876 --> 01:35:51.881
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

01:35:53.174 --> 01:35:55.760
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

01:35:55.844 --> 01:35:58.722
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

01:35:58.805 --> 01:36:05.478
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

01:36:06.187 --> 01:36:07.981
That an accusation?

01:36:08.064 --> 01:36:13.278
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

01:36:13.778 --> 01:36:17.282
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

01:36:17.365 --> 01:36:20.535
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

01:36:20.618 --> 01:36:23.830
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

01:36:23.913 --> 01:36:28.918
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

01:36:31.212 --> 01:36:32.756
Yes, sir.

01:36:32.839 --> 01:36:35.216
Just as long as you're the commandant.

01:36:36.885 --> 01:36:38.970
Yes, Sergeant.

01:36:41.097 --> 01:36:44.851
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

01:36:44.934 --> 01:36:51.608
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martial

01:36:51.691 --> 01:36:57.739
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

01:37:01.993 --> 01:37:04.704
I wish you luck.

01:37:38.404 --> 01:37:42.742
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

01:37:42.826 --> 01:37:47.080
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

01:37:56.923 --> 01:38:01.469
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:19.028
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

01:38:19.112 --> 01:38:24.409
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

01:38:24.909 --> 01:38:26.995
Get in.

01:38:30.582 --> 01:38:32.750
(door is locked)

01:38:35.044 --> 01:38:38.256
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

01:38:39.549 --> 01:38:42.677
There's no formalities here.

01:38:53.104 --> 01:38:55.732
It's been a long time.

01:38:55.815 --> 01:38:58.651
(Tuco's stomach rumbles)

01:38:58.735 --> 01:39:00.945
You're hungry.

01:39:01.029 --> 01:39:03.740
Sit down. Eat.

01:39:22.175 --> 01:39:25.637
I knew it, I knew it!

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.851
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."

01:39:32.852 --> 01:39:36.314
"I bet he got himself an easy job."

01:39:38.733 --> 01:39:41.444
"And he never forgets a friend."

01:39:41.527 --> 01:39:44.655
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

01:39:46.074 --> 01:39:47.658
Right.

01:39:47.742 --> 01:39:51.079
It's good to see old friends again.

01:39:51.162 --> 01:39:52.705
Good.

01:39:52.789 --> 01:39:56.209
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

01:39:56.292 --> 01:39:59.837
And have so much to talk about.

01:39:59.921 --> 01:40:03.299
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

01:40:05.593 --> 01:40:09.389
You were captured near Fort Craig?

01:40:13.559 --> 01:40:20.066
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

01:40:31.452 --> 01:40:36.999
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

01:40:37.083 --> 01:40:40.294
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:48.219
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:53.683
One name is as good as another.

01:40:53.766 --> 01:40:56.686
Not wise to use your own name.

01:40:56.769 --> 01:41:01.149
Like you.
I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

01:41:01.232 --> 01:41:04.193
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.246
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

01:41:15.329 --> 01:41:21.335
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

01:41:33.097 --> 01:41:35.391
So...

01:41:35.474 --> 01:41:39.520
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

01:41:43.482 --> 01:41:46.819
That fake, too?

01:41:46.903 --> 01:41:51.115
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

01:41:51.198 --> 01:41:56.037
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

01:41:58.456 --> 01:42:00.333
Aarh!

01:42:01.167 --> 01:42:04.170
(mournful tune)

01:43:18.911 --> 01:43:23.332
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

01:43:28.254 --> 01:43:30.548
What did he tell you about the money?

01:43:30.631 --> 01:43:33.259
I don't...

01:43:33.342 --> 01:43:36.053
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

01:43:54.446 --> 01:43:56.365
More feeling.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.470
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

01:44:18.554 --> 01:44:21.515
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

01:44:21.599 --> 01:44:25.144
So many of us
have had a session in there.

01:44:45.748 --> 01:44:49.168
How's your digestion now?

01:44:51.879 --> 01:44:57.259
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

01:45:23.619 --> 01:45:26.330
Play that fiddle, you.

01:46:01.615 --> 01:46:04.076
(screams)

01:46:09.915 --> 01:46:12.126
I'll talk... I'll talk...

01:46:21.593 --> 01:46:24.388
What did he say about the money?

01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:27.933
It's bu...

01:46:28.016 --> 01:46:31.520
It's buried in a grave.

01:46:31.603 --> 01:46:33.313
Where?

01:46:33.397 --> 01:46:34.815
Sad Hill...

01:46:34.898 --> 01:46:37.401
Sad Hill cemetery.

01:46:40.112 --> 01:46:42.072
Which grave?

01:46:42.156 --> 01:46:46.076
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

01:46:47.703 --> 01:46:49.663
Blondie...

01:46:49.746 --> 01:46:54.543
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

01:47:11.226 --> 01:47:14.354
The war's over for you.

01:47:16.315 --> 01:47:19.443
Put those clothes on.

01:47:22.654 --> 01:47:24.406
Why?

01:47:24.489 --> 01:47:27.451
We're going for a ride.

01:47:27.534 --> 01:47:31.538
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

01:47:31.622 --> 01:47:34.833
I know the name of the cemetery now.

01:47:34.917 --> 01:47:38.420
And you know the name of the grave.

01:47:57.481 --> 01:48:00.609
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

01:48:04.029 --> 01:48:05.989
Would you talk?

01:48:06.823 --> 01:48:08.575
No. Probably not.

01:48:10.327 --> 01:48:12.913
That's what I thought.

01:48:12.996 --> 01:48:15.374
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

01:48:15.457 --> 01:48:18.835
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

01:48:22.547 --> 01:48:25.759
And Tuco? Is he...

01:48:27.844 --> 01:48:30.931
No. Not yet.

01:48:31.014 --> 01:48:33.600
But he's in very good hands.

01:48:34.309 --> 01:48:37.813
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deal.

01:48:37.896 --> 01:48:40.440
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

01:48:41.775 --> 01:48:45.737
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

01:48:50.575 --> 01:48:52.661
Yeah.

01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:13.390
Hold it.

01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:16.268
That's it. Don't move.

01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:21.898
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

01:49:21.982 --> 01:49:25.277
Got it. Thank you.

01:49:39.875 --> 01:49:43.628
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

01:49:43.712 --> 01:49:47.340
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

01:49:47.424 --> 01:49:52.554
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

01:49:52.637 --> 01:49:56.391
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

01:50:01.521 --> 01:50:03.273
I told you once, friend.

01:50:03.356 --> 01:50:08.195
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

01:50:28.131 --> 01:50:30.342
You're a lot luckier than that one.

01:50:30.425 --> 01:50:33.011
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

01:50:33.094 --> 01:50:36.973
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

01:52:04.644 --> 01:52:07.313
(rustling)

01:52:18.074 --> 01:52:23.079
If your friends stay out in the damp,
they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?

01:52:23.163 --> 01:52:25.540
Or a bullet.

01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:33.047
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

01:52:44.267 --> 01:52:49.189
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

01:52:49.272 --> 01:52:51.733
One, two,

01:52:51.816 --> 01:52:53.860
three, four,

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.738
five, six.

01:52:57.197 --> 01:53:00.366
Six... Perfect number.

01:53:01.659 --> 01:53:04.621
Isn't three the perfect number?

01:53:05.747 --> 01:53:10.210
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

01:53:11.794 --> 01:53:13.880
(chuckles)

01:53:16.633 --> 01:53:18.927
(train whistle)

01:54:12.605 --> 01:54:17.277
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.073
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

01:54:22.156 --> 01:54:24.951
You smell like a pig already.

01:54:25.034 --> 01:54:27.870
Let's try not to make things any worse.

01:54:30.164 --> 01:54:32.250
Get going.

01:54:40.466 --> 01:54:44.137
I can't while you're watching me.

01:54:55.148 --> 01:54:57.108
Aaaarh!

01:55:06.576 --> 01:55:10.329
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

01:55:30.641 --> 01:55:34.604
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

01:55:59.212 --> 01:56:01.798
(train approaching)

01:57:18.749 --> 01:57:21.585
Squad, halt.

01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:24.547
Take your places.

01:57:34.724 --> 01:57:36.642
Ready.

01:57:36.726 --> 01:57:38.227
Aim.

01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:40.396
Fire.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:59.415
Clem, take care of the horses.

01:58:02.626 --> 01:58:05.129
(cannon fire)

01:58:21.937 --> 01:58:24.690
(whistle of cannonball)

02:01:30.459 --> 02:01:32.628
(splash of water)

02:01:45.974 --> 02:01:49.186
(Tuco sings quietly to himself)

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.423
I've been looking for you for eight months.

02:02:18.507 --> 02:02:23.095
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

02:02:23.178 --> 02:02:27.140
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

02:02:27.224 --> 02:02:33.063
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

02:02:47.035 --> 02:02:51.665
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

02:02:53.292 --> 02:02:56.378
Every gun makes its own tune.

02:02:56.461 --> 02:02:59.923
It's perfect timing, large one.

02:03:16.773 --> 02:03:19.318
Clem, follow him.

02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:54.936
(tsks)

02:04:05.238 --> 02:04:08.617
(banging on door)

02:04:16.375 --> 02:04:19.378
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

02:04:19.461 --> 02:04:23.215
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

02:04:40.315 --> 02:04:42.192
(gun cocks)

02:04:43.443 --> 02:04:46.988
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:57.124
Hey...

02:04:57.207 --> 02:05:01.878
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:07.801
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

02:05:08.301 --> 02:05:11.721
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

02:05:12.347 --> 02:05:17.102
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

02:05:18.395 --> 02:05:21.022
You... me...

02:05:21.148 --> 02:05:23.984
So only you know your half of the secret?

02:05:24.734 --> 02:05:26.278
Mm-hm.

02:05:27.404 --> 02:05:31.032
Ah, Blondie...

02:05:31.116 --> 02:05:35.495
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

02:05:35.579 --> 02:05:39.166
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

02:05:39.249 --> 02:05:43.295
I forgot to mention.

02:05:43.378 --> 02:05:48.133
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

02:05:48.216 --> 02:05:51.595
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:57.642
So that's why you came to Tuco.

02:05:59.728 --> 02:06:02.439
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

02:06:14.075 --> 02:06:17.287
They shot him at close range.

02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:19.664
(whistle of cannonball)

02:06:35.764 --> 02:06:40.727
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

02:06:42.729 --> 02:06:46.316
They'll come looking for us.

02:06:46.399 --> 02:06:48.610
Watch out.

02:06:48.693 --> 02:06:51.738
There's two of them.

02:06:51.821 --> 02:06:54.074
I want that blond alive.

02:07:02.916 --> 02:07:06.628
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

02:07:40.286 --> 02:07:42.622
Were you going to die alone?

02:08:57.488 --> 02:09:00.408
(whistle of cannonball)

02:09:07.707 --> 02:09:09.792
(coughing)

02:09:28.645 --> 02:09:29.729
(whistles)

02:09:32.982 --> 02:09:34.275
Ho!

02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:50.166
(noise above)

02:09:59.342 --> 02:10:02.428
Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.

02:10:02.512 --> 02:10:04.097
AII right.

02:10:43.428 --> 02:10:48.224
"See you soon, l... idi.."

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:50.893
"Idiots."

02:10:50.977 --> 02:10:53.271
It's for you.

02:11:17.503 --> 02:11:20.465
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

02:11:20.548 --> 02:11:24.218
Like a cemetery, for instance?

02:11:24.302 --> 02:11:27.221
There should be a bridge
across that river.

02:11:27.305 --> 02:11:32.935
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

02:11:33.019 --> 02:11:35.771
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

02:11:35.855 --> 02:11:39.901
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

02:11:44.947 --> 02:11:48.034
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

02:11:48.117 --> 02:11:51.454
Come along, now. Follow me.

02:12:37.124 --> 02:12:40.670
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:56.352
Where do you hail from?

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:57.853
IIlinois.

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:02.149
And you?

02:13:02.233 --> 02:13:04.110
I'm with him.

02:13:10.074 --> 02:13:13.452
Any reason for being around here?

02:13:13.536 --> 02:13:16.497
We want to enlist, General.

02:13:19.041 --> 02:13:21.377
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.546
I'm a captain.

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.675
Get the hell out.

02:13:27.758 --> 02:13:30.761
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

02:13:30.845 --> 02:13:32.930
Yes, sir.

02:13:37.727 --> 02:13:39.979
So you want to enlist?

02:13:40.896 --> 02:13:44.650
You've got to take a test to prove it.

02:13:52.616 --> 02:13:55.119
Well, show me.

02:14:13.053 --> 02:14:16.140
Hey... (chuckles)

02:14:17.892 --> 02:14:22.313
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.

02:14:22.396 --> 02:14:25.191
- Really?
- Sure.

02:14:25.274 --> 02:14:27.401
Like it says in the manual,

02:14:27.485 --> 02:14:32.865
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

02:14:32.948 --> 02:14:38.078
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war. (exhales)

02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:43.459
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

02:14:44.585 --> 02:14:46.670
Volunteers.

02:14:48.130 --> 02:14:52.593
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

02:14:52.676 --> 02:14:55.804
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

02:14:57.264 --> 02:15:00.726
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

02:15:09.193 --> 02:15:10.736
Eh?

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:19.328
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:23.457
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:29.964
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

02:15:30.047 --> 02:15:32.424
AII of us reek of alcohol.

02:15:40.224 --> 02:15:42.893
What did you say your name was?

02:15:42.977 --> 02:15:44.311
Uh...

02:15:45.145 --> 02:15:47.273
And you?

02:15:48.065 --> 02:15:49.149
Uh...

02:15:49.233 --> 02:15:51.235
"Uh." No.

02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.951
Names don't matter.

02:15:59.034 --> 02:16:04.623
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

02:16:04.707 --> 02:16:07.001
We have two attacks a day.

02:16:07.084 --> 02:16:09.753
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

02:16:09.837 --> 02:16:15.009
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

02:16:15.092 --> 02:16:18.220
Stupid, useless bridge.

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:21.557
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

02:16:22.599 --> 02:16:28.105
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

02:16:29.148 --> 02:16:31.316
Even if all of us are killed.

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:36.989
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

02:16:37.072 --> 02:16:41.785
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

02:16:41.869 --> 02:16:47.124
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

02:16:48.959 --> 02:16:53.297
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.760
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

02:16:57.843 --> 02:17:03.056
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:06.435
I've done a lot worse.

02:17:09.605 --> 02:17:14.109
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

02:17:14.193 --> 02:17:17.404
In here, I've destroyed it all.

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:23.577
It's a court-martial offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:29.291
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

02:17:30.751 --> 02:17:33.003
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

02:17:34.671 --> 02:17:38.050
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

02:17:38.133 --> 02:17:40.469
(laughs)

02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:44.598
I've been dreaming about it.

02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:50.562
I've even worked out a plan.

02:17:50.646 --> 02:17:52.648
I sure have.

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:56.860
The best time is after the attack,

02:17:56.944 --> 02:18:00.822
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

02:18:00.906 --> 02:18:05.911
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

02:18:05.994 --> 02:18:08.288
(soldiers shout)

02:18:10.874 --> 02:18:14.002
But what I lack is the guts.

02:18:19.216 --> 02:18:22.469
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

02:18:22.553 --> 02:18:25.931
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

02:18:26.014 --> 02:18:28.725
Be right there.

02:18:41.238 --> 02:18:43.365
Let's go.

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:45.367
AII right, friends.

02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:48.704
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

02:19:08.765 --> 02:19:11.560
(bugle call)

02:19:19.026 --> 02:19:21.528
Companies, report.

02:19:21.611 --> 02:19:24.406
Company B ready.

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.284
Company E ready.

02:19:27.367 --> 02:19:30.495
Company D ready.

02:19:35.375 --> 02:19:39.129
Companies, forward!

02:19:39.212 --> 02:19:41.465
(battle cries)

02:20:00.067 --> 02:20:04.029
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

02:20:04.112 --> 02:20:06.198
Yeah.

02:20:58.458 --> 02:21:02.837
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:26.820
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

02:21:30.115 --> 02:21:32.325
Blondie...

02:21:32.409 --> 02:21:35.036
The money's on the other side of the river.

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:38.039
Oh? Where?

02:21:40.375 --> 02:21:44.296
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

02:21:44.379 --> 02:21:48.925
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

02:21:49.009 --> 02:21:54.139
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

02:21:54.222 --> 02:22:00.228
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

02:22:00.312 --> 02:22:02.397
Maybe.

02:22:39.559 --> 02:22:43.563
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:47.734
Hurry, a stretcher.

02:22:48.818 --> 02:22:51.654
Easy. Easy now.

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.951
Arh!

02:23:01.581 --> 02:23:04.292
Get things ready.

02:23:24.145 --> 02:23:26.981
A little of this will help.

02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:35.031
Take a slug of this, Captain.

02:23:35.114 --> 02:23:37.116
And keep your ears open.

02:24:23.705 --> 02:24:25.707
(grunting)

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:29.627
(man) What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

02:26:08.017 --> 02:26:12.105
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

02:26:12.647 --> 02:26:18.402
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

02:26:18.486 --> 02:26:20.321
Yeah, Tuco.

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:23.574
Sure would be a pity.

02:26:53.479 --> 02:26:54.647
Doc...

02:26:56.899 --> 02:27:01.696
Doctor... Can you help me
Iive a little longer?

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:04.740
I expect good news.

02:27:17.003 --> 02:27:18.546
(gasps)

02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:53.372
Eh... Eh...

02:27:54.749 --> 02:27:57.877
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:00.463
Why don't we?

02:28:01.505 --> 02:28:03.549
You go first.

02:28:05.301 --> 02:28:10.139
No, I think it's better that...

02:28:10.222 --> 02:28:12.600
you start.

02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:18.481
AII right.

02:28:19.315 --> 02:28:23.903
The name of the cemetery is...

02:28:39.794 --> 02:28:42.004
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

02:28:50.262 --> 02:28:53.057
The name on the grave is...

02:28:56.519 --> 02:28:58.562
Arch Stanton.

02:28:58.646 --> 02:29:02.149
Ar... Arch Stanton?

02:29:02.233 --> 02:29:04.485
Are you sure?

02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:06.737
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

02:30:58.974 --> 02:31:01.310
(snoring)

02:34:06.787 --> 02:34:08.956
(grunts)

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:50.080
(horse neighs)

02:35:23.363 --> 02:35:26.324
(Tuco) Haa! Haa!

02:40:55.028 --> 02:40:58.614
It'll be a lot easier with that.

02:41:37.695 --> 02:41:39.864
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:42.575
Dig.

02:41:44.577 --> 02:41:46.287
You're not digging.

02:41:58.758 --> 02:42:03.137
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

02:42:04.013 --> 02:42:05.348
Why?

02:42:08.267 --> 02:42:10.895
I'll tell you why.

02:42:10.978 --> 02:42:13.481
Cos there's nothing in there.

02:42:21.572 --> 02:42:24.825
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

02:42:28.204 --> 02:42:31.832
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

02:42:31.916 --> 02:42:35.044
We're gonna have to earn it.

02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:39.924
How?

02:42:49.892 --> 02:42:52.728
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

02:42:56.524 --> 02:42:58.651
The gun?

02:49:04.516 --> 02:49:08.687
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

02:49:10.689 --> 02:49:12.899
Last night.

02:49:12.983 --> 02:49:17.696
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

02:49:17.779 --> 02:49:22.451
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

02:49:22.534 --> 02:49:24.494
You dig.

02:49:24.578 --> 02:49:26.705
Where?

02:49:36.506 --> 02:49:38.884
Here.

02:49:39.801 --> 02:49:41.678
Unk... Un...

02:49:41.762 --> 02:49:44.681
There's no name on it.

02:49:44.765 --> 02:49:47.476
And there's no name here, either.

02:49:48.769 --> 02:49:51.772
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

02:49:51.855 --> 02:49:56.651
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:05.952
Go ahead.

02:50:19.591 --> 02:50:22.469
(little pants of excitement)

02:51:02.717 --> 02:51:06.471
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

02:51:22.445 --> 02:51:27.617
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

02:51:27.701 --> 02:51:31.037
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

02:51:31.121 --> 02:51:34.499
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

02:51:53.435 --> 02:51:55.604
(cross creaks)

02:52:41.650 --> 02:52:45.695
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

02:52:50.283 --> 02:52:52.994
Four for you.

02:52:54.204 --> 02:52:57.332
And four...

02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:01.002
Four for me.

02:53:27.028 --> 02:53:28.446
Hey, Blon...

02:53:28.530 --> 02:53:29.864
Blon...

02:53:38.998 --> 02:53:41.376
Hey, Blondie...

02:53:42.627 --> 02:53:45.338
Sorry, Tuco.

02:53:48.341 --> 02:53:49.717
Blondie...

02:53:58.852 --> 02:54:01.187
Blondie!

02:54:09.028 --> 02:54:11.197
Blondie!

02:54:20.957 --> 02:54:22.041
Blondie...

02:54:32.677 --> 02:54:34.554
Blondie...

02:54:49.736 --> 02:54:52.405
Blondie!

02:55:13.593 --> 02:55:16.471
You son of a bitch...

02:55:18.806 --> 02:55:21.267
Blondie...

02:55:42.121 --> 02:55:44.499
Aaaarhh!

02:56:20.410 --> 02:56:23.579
Hey, Blondie!

02:56:24.455 --> 02:56:27.750
You know what you are?

02:56:30.962 --> 02:56:32.839
Just a dirty son of a...

02:56:32.922 --> 02:56:38.177
(melds into theme music)
