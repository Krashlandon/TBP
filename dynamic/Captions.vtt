WEBVTT

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.222
I'm voting for Dukakis.

00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:27.810
Hmm.

00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:29.937
Well.

00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:35.026
Maybe when you have children
of your own who need braces,

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:38.112
and you can't afford them because
half your husband's paycheck

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:40.323
goes to the federal government,

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:43.409
- you'll regret that.
- My "husband's paycheck"?

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:49.457
Anyway, I'm not gonna squeeze
one out till I'm, like, 30.

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:53.002
Will you still be working at the Yarn
Barn? Because I hear it's a really

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:55.963
- great place to raise children.
- That's really funny.

00:04:56.088 --> 00:05:00.343
No, a year of partying's enough.
She'll be going to Harvard next fall.

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.428
Mum, I haven't even gotten in yet.

00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:06.390
You honestly think Dukakis will provide for
this country till you squeeze one out?

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.559
Yeah. I do.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:12.980
- Can I squeeze one out?
- Not till eighth grade.

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.565
Excuse me.

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:17.944
Donnie, you're such a dick.

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:19.487
Whoa, Elizabeth.

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:22.323
A little hostile there.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:27.620
Mum and Dad should pay a therapist
$200 an hour to listen to you

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.497
so we don't have to.

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:34.126
OK. Wanna tell Mum and Dad why
you stopped taking your medication?

00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:37.255
- You're such a fuck-ass.
- What?!

00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:40.675
- Please.
- Did he call me a fuck-ass?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.885
- Hey, Sweetie.
- That's enough.

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.639
- You can go suck a fuck.
- How does one do that?

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:48.474
- Want me to tell you?
- Please, tell me.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.185
We will not have this at the dinner table.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.354
Stop!

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:07.326
What's a fuck-ass?

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.128
I'm reading. Get out of my room.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.426
Where do you go at night?

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:26.554
Will you just get out of my room?

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:28.472
Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?

00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:31.350
- You came to ask me that?
- No.

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.021
I stopped rolling houses in sixth grade, Mum.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.358
What happened to my son?
I don't recognise this person today.

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:41.903
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills!

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.498
Bitch.

00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.426
Our son just called me a bitch.

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:10.389
You're not a bitch.

00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:15.436
You're bitching, but you're not a bitch.

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:56.018
'I want to be a president of
the Unites States who makes sure

00:07:56.143 --> 00:08:00.231
'we never again do business
with a Panamanian dictator.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:04.068
- 'That we never again funnel aid...'
- Dukakis.

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.196
- Son of a bitch.
- 'Panama is a friendly country.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.449

'Closer.'

28 days,

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.975
six hours,

42 minutes,

12 seconds.

00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:15.866
That is when the world will end.

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:18.911
Why?

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.391
Son?

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:24.977
Son? Donnie Darko?

00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:27.229
Donnie Darko?

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.648
- What the heck's going on?
- Who is it, Don?

00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:33.903
It's Eddie Darko's kid. I'm sorry
about this. He's just a neighbourhood kid.

00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:38.574
Guess he was sleep-golfing.

00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:41.285
Watch out for that drool spot.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.497
Are you all right, son?

00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:55.883
So... Let's stay off the links at night, OK?

00:11:56.008 --> 00:12:00.304
I'm sorry, Dr Fisher. It won't happen again.

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:04.391
- I hate kids.
- Let's golf.

00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:14.693
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.946
What happened to your house?

00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:22.826
- No-one's allowed through...
- This is my house!

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.789
He's OK.

00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:31.335
Donnie, we know you're OK!

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:36.173
Channel 6 News.
We have just arrived on the scene...

00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.983
Wait a minute. Here's your brother.

00:12:54.066 --> 00:12:56.860
- Oh!
- It fell in your room.

00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:59.738
Watch yourself down there!

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:21.593
Mrs Darko? I'm Bob Garland. I'm with the FAA.

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:24.513
- You're what?
- I'm with the FAA.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.474
If you don't mind, we'd like to speak
to you and Mr Darko privately.

00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:29.768
- In private?
- Please.

00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:33.314
All right.

00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:42.323
You see that little red thing in there?

00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:50.539
And... here.

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:52.791
- You got it.
- All right.

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:57.004
We have arranged for you
to stay at a hotel, get some sleep.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:00.841
- We will take care of things here.
- Thank you.

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:03.469
Kids, we're going to a hotel.

00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:06.138
They don't know where it came from.

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:24.114
'Transportation
authorities have begun a search...'

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.450
Frankie Feedler.

'...no airline will claim ownership...'

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.996
You remember him?

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.999
From high school.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.461
Hmm.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.714
He died.

00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:45.969
- On his way to the prom.
- Mm.

00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.138
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.018
They said he was doomed.

00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:55.687
Mm.

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.983
Jesus.

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:04.363
They could have said the same thing about Donnie.

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:13.580
If it fell from a plane,
then what happened to the plane?

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:17.334
They don't know, Samantha.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:31.473
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Bye, honey.

00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:34.309
Donnie. Good luck.

00:15:34.435 --> 00:15:36.812
Oh, my God. OK, tell me everything.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:39.857
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:43.026
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.696
Darko cheats death, uh?

00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:47.948
You're like a celebrity, man.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.284
I've been calling you a gillion times.
Where you been?

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.244
We stayed at a hotel.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:56.248
My dad saw you at the golf course.
You sleepwalking again now buddy?

00:15:56.373 --> 00:16:01.753
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Now you're famous, have a smoke.

00:16:05.257 --> 00:16:07.759
What happens if you tell
Mum and Dad about this, Sam?

00:16:07.885 --> 00:16:10.846
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:14.725
- Goddamn right I will.
- So grody.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.519
Hey, Cherita. You want a cigarette?

00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:20.397
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:22.691
Go back to China, bitch.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.279
Just leave her alone.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.906
Some good shit, huh?

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.242
It's a fucking cigarette.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:08.357
"There would be headlines in the papers.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.443
"Even the guys who ran the betting
at the wrestling

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.820
"and the barrow boys would hear with respect

00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:16.531
"how Old Misery's house had been destroyed.

"It was as though this plan
had been with him all his life,

00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.246
"pondered through the seasons,

00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:28.001
"now in his 15th year crystallised
with the pain of puberty."

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:35.258
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

00:19:35.384 --> 00:19:38.595
Why did the children break into
Old Misery's house?

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:42.557
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:45.560
Joanie, if you had actually read the short story,

00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:48.563
which at a whooping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,

00:19:48.647 --> 00:19:53.235
you would know that the children find a
great deal of money in the mattress,

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.696
but they burn it.

00:19:58.073 --> 00:20:00.367
Donnie Darko,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.286
perhaps with your recent brush
with mass destruction

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:05.664
you can give us your opinion.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:10.127
Well, they say when they flood
the house and tear it to shreds

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.963
that destruction is a form of creation,

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:16.174
so the fact that they burn the money is ironic.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.679
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.639
They wanna change things.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.731
May We help you?

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:35.068
I just registered. They put me
in the wrong English class.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.529
You look like you belong here.

00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:41.032
Um, where do I sit?

00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:47.205
Sit next to the boy you think is the cutest.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:52.169
Quiet. Let her choose.

00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:14.065
Joanie, get up.

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:41.009
Well, the construction guys
say it'll take a week to fix the roof.

00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:44.012
That airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.266
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:50.602
Where it came from.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:53.772
No. Apparently they can't tell us
what happened yet.

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:58.860
Something about a matching
serial number that got burned.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:04.241
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:07.661
We're not supposed to tell anyone
what nobody knows?

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:09.579
Yeah.

00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:14.084
But you tell... What's your doctor's name?

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.503
- Dr Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.422
You tell Dr Thurman whatever you want.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.591
- Dad.
- What?

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:23.301
Dad!

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:48.451
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.596
Well, what did she say to you?

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:18.273
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:20.150
Imaginary-

00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:21.985
Would you like to talk about this friend?

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:25.405
- Frank.
- Frank.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.658
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.869
- Follow him where?
- Into the future.

00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:34.497
And then what happens?

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:38.376
And then he said...

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:42.756
Then he said the world is coming to an end.

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:45.050
Do you think it's coming to an end?

00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:52.557
No.

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.061
That's stupid.

00:23:57.729 --> 00:24:01.733
'For my entire life
I was a victim of my own fear.'

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:05.028
'Love!

00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:09.199
'I was feeding fear through food.'

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.455
'Fear'

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.297
'And finally I looked in the mirror.

00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:28.969
'Not just in the mirror.
I looked through the mirror.

00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:33.390
'In that image I saw my ego reflection.'

00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:39.854
'I thought ten-year-olds normally wet the bed...'

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.816
Shh!

00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:49.823
'The solution was there all the time.'

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:52.659
'I'm not afraid any more!'

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.790
'All over America, people have
come together to join hands.

00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:06.548
'People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,

00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:11.970
'too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.891
'Hello.

00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:20.603
'My name is Jim Cunningham.
Welcome to "Controlling Fear."'

00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:35.076
'Wake up, Donnie.'

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.202
"And the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic."

00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:19.204
Hey, guess what!

00:26:19.329 --> 00:26:21.372
I can't believe it!

00:26:22.499 --> 00:26:25.126
The school is closed today because it's flooded.

00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:27.295
- No way.
- Yeah.

00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:30.381
Holy shit! That's the best news I've ever heard.

00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:40.016
My God. Is this ever gonna stop?

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.938
Eventually, yes. But I've got
12 classrooms full of water,

00:26:45.063 --> 00:26:47.899
all coming from a busted water main.

00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:51.111
- What else?
- What else?!

00:26:51.194 --> 00:26:53.947
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.

00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:00.453
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:02.372
How did this happen?

00:27:03.123 --> 00:27:07.335
The boys' locker room was flooded.
They found faeces everywhere.

00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:10.338
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:31.109
Hey.

00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:34.445
Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?

00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:37.574
I like your boobs.

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:39.117
Hey.

00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:42.370
Hey.

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.539
School's cancelled.

00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:48.918
Do you want to walk me home?

00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:51.754
Sure.

00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:02.682
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:06.477
Check your backpack.
Those guys love to steal shit.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.943
- So, why did you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

00:28:14.027 --> 00:28:17.363
My mum had to get a restraining order
against my stepdad.

00:28:17.447 --> 00:28:22.493
- He has emotional problems.
- Me too. What kind does he have?

00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:25.872
He stabbed my mum four times in the chest.

00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:29.709
Oh. Did he go to jail?

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.504
No, he fled. They still can't find him,

00:28:33.588 --> 00:28:39.093
but my mum and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was cool.

00:28:39.177 --> 00:28:41.429
I was in jail once.

00:28:41.512 --> 00:28:44.307
I mean... I accidentally burned down this house.

00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:46.517
It was abandoned, but still...

00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:50.939
I got held back in school,
I can't drive till I'm 21, you know.

00:28:51.022 --> 00:28:53.608
But I'm over all of that. I...

00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:57.403
I'm painting and stuff. Writing.

00:28:57.487 --> 00:29:01.407
I want to be a writer. Maybe a painter,
I don't know. Maybe both.

00:29:01.491 --> 00:29:04.827
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.

00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:08.456
Then maybe people will
understand me. Change things.

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.416
Donnie Darko?

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.255
What the hell kind of name is that?
It's like some sort of superhero.

00:29:15.338 --> 00:29:17.465
What makes you think I'm not?

00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:24.013
Look, I should go.

00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:26.933
For Physics, Monnitoff wants me
to write this essay.

00:29:27.058 --> 00:29:30.061
Greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:36.359
If it's Monnitoff, that's easy. Antiseptics.

00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:40.780
The whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister, 1895.

00:29:40.863 --> 00:29:43.074
Before antiseptics there was no sanitation.

00:29:43.157 --> 00:29:46.828
- Especially in medicine.
- You mean soap?

00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:56.754
I'm really glad school was flooded today.

00:29:56.838 --> 00:29:58.923
Why's that?

00:29:59.007 --> 00:30:02.093
You and I would never have had this conversation.

00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:06.472
You're weird.

00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:08.266
Sorry.

00:30:08.349 --> 00:30:10.852
No, that was a compliment.

00:30:14.522 --> 00:30:16.733
Well, look, um...

00:30:18.026 --> 00:30:20.611
You wanna go with me?

00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:24.824
Where do you wanna go?

00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:30.246
I mean, like, go with me. You know...
That's what we call it here.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.582
- Going together...
- Sure.

00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:38.629
OK. Where are you going?

00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:42.633
I'm going home.

00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:48.806
So stupid! Where are you going?

00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:01.944
I'd like to try something new this time.

00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:06.657
Have you ever been hypnotised?

00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:10.286
No.

00:31:18.878 --> 00:31:23.007
When I clap my hands twice, you
will wake up. Do you understand?

00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:24.842
Yes.

00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:29.180
So, tell me about your week.

00:31:29.263 --> 00:31:30.932
I met a girl.

00:31:34.394 --> 00:31:37.438
- What is her name?
- Gretchen.

00:31:39.357 --> 00:31:41.442
We're going together now.

00:31:43.444 --> 00:31:46.406
Do you still think about girls a lot?

00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:48.866
Yeah.

00:31:52.328 --> 00:31:54.414
How are things going at school?

00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:58.000
I think about girls a lot.

00:31:58.084 --> 00:32:00.711
I asked you about school, Donnie.

00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:04.465
I think about fucking a lot during school.

00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:08.636
What else do you think about during school?

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:12.640
- "Married With Children."
- Do you think about your family?

00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:17.812
I just turn down the volume and think
about fucking Christina Applegate.

00:32:17.895 --> 00:32:20.731
I asked you about your family, Donnie.

00:32:20.815 --> 00:32:22.900
No.

00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:26.696
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

00:32:27.864 --> 00:32:30.491
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:49.552
Sam Bylen.

00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:09.280
Donald Darko.

00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:34.805
Daye Dennis.

00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:42.438
Hey, you fuck.

00:33:42.563 --> 00:33:45.107
Did you tell them I flooded the school?

00:33:47.443 --> 00:33:51.531
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.

00:33:51.614 --> 00:33:54.784
If you're innocent, then
you have nothing to worry about.

00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:58.538
Fuck you! You know what I think?

00:34:00.373 --> 00:34:02.708
I think you did it.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.977
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.521
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.

00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:25.731
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.

00:34:25.856 --> 00:34:28.651
Not some tight-assed Middlesex chick.

00:34:28.734 --> 00:34:32.154
A cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys.

00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:36.409
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.206
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.251
Because all the other smurfs
were getting too horny.

00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:48.087
Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.466
OK, she fucks them while Vanity watches. OK?

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:56.304
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.931
Yeah. When he does, he films the gangbang.

00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:01.934
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:07.690
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.

00:35:07.773 --> 00:35:12.320
She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy,
to destroy the smurf village.

00:35:12.403 --> 00:35:16.782
But the overwhelming goodness
of the smurf way of life transformed her.

00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:19.535
And as for the whole gangbang scenario,

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:22.163
it just couldn't happen.

00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:25.374
Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have...

00:35:25.458 --> 00:35:28.836
reproductive organs
under those little white pants.

00:35:30.421 --> 00:35:34.175
That's what's so illogical, you know,
about being a smurf.

00:35:34.258 --> 00:35:36.927
What's the point of living

00:35:37.011 --> 00:35:39.263
if you don't have a dick?

00:35:42.725 --> 00:35:45.936
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get so smart on us?

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.273
Grandma Death.

00:35:49.398 --> 00:35:52.318
Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:35:53.361 --> 00:35:58.616
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.

00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.536
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.

00:36:02.662 --> 00:36:04.622
Yeah.

00:36:05.456 --> 00:36:08.250
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:12.421
She does the same thing every day.

00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:17.259
Just walks back and forth,
back and forth to the mailbox.

00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:22.056
And nothing ever in there.

00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:26.435
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:36:28.354 --> 00:36:30.773
She's going back to the box.

00:36:30.898 --> 00:36:32.650
We may still have mail.

00:36:32.775 --> 00:36:35.152
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:38.322
This could be it. Oh!

00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:41.075
No dice, Grandma. No, sorry.

00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:43.327
Someone ought to write that bitch.

00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:45.705
'Authorities continued their search

00:36:45.788 --> 00:36:48.999
'for a suspect in the school vandalism.

00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:53.754
'The school has asked for donations
to help restore its mascot,

00:36:53.838 --> 00:36:56.298
'known only as the Mongrel.'

00:37:01.846 --> 00:37:04.598
In cooperation with the county police,

00:37:04.682 --> 00:37:09.186
we have begun investigating
the cause of the flooding

00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:12.732
and our suspects include
several of our own students.

00:37:12.815 --> 00:37:17.403
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

00:37:26.746 --> 00:37:30.750
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:34.712
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,

00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:38.215
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.888
Therefore, I am the only person here who
transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:49.602
'Don't worry.

00:37:50.227 --> 00:37:52.313
'You got away with it.'

00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:55.900
I have in my hand
Graham Greene's "The Destructors."

00:37:56.025 --> 00:38:00.780
This short story is part of
my daughter's English assignment.

00:38:00.863 --> 00:38:05.409
In this story, several children
destroy an elderly man's house

00:38:05.493 --> 00:38:07.369
from inside out.

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:22.551
How can you do that?

00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:31.936
And how do they do this?

00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:36.899
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:41.111
'I can do anything I want.

00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:44.156
'And so can you.'

00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:47.576
We pay good money for this school
It's our children.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.288
And I think that this garbage should be removed.

00:38:51.413 --> 00:38:53.165
Excuse me.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.085
What's the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

00:38:56.293 --> 00:39:02.424
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography is being taught.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:08.180
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.

00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:10.683
Why did you make me flood the school?

00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:18.023
They are in great danger.

00:39:18.148 --> 00:39:21.443
Kitty, do you even know who Graham Greene is?

00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:24.822
I think we have all seen "Bonanza."

00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:32.121
Well, uh... while we are on other topics...

00:39:32.246 --> 00:39:34.456
Where did you come from?

00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.669
Do you believe in time travel?

00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:43.507
Who are you talking to?

00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:49.763
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

00:39:59.732 --> 00:40:01.984
'It is time to breathe.'

00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:04.486
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

00:40:05.446 --> 00:40:07.698
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:12.161
'So, now let us begin lifeline exercise No.1.

00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:14.538
'Please press stop now.'

00:40:21.462 --> 00:40:27.301
As you can see, the lifeline is divided
into two polar extremes.

00:40:27.384 --> 00:40:29.803
Fear and love.

00:40:29.887 --> 00:40:33.766
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:37.394
and love is in the positive energy spectrum.

00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:39.772
- Duh!
- Excuse me?

00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:43.734
"Duh" is a product of fear.

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:49.573
Now, on each card is a character dilemma

00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:52.242
which applies to the lifeline.

00:40:54.578 --> 00:40:57.081
Please... Take this.

00:40:57.164 --> 00:40:59.041
Thank you.

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:02.002
Please read each character dilemma aloud

00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:06.632
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

00:41:06.757 --> 00:41:08.717
Cherita?

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.062
"Juanita has an important math test today.

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:24.566
"She has known about the test for
several weeks but has not studied.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:28.028
"In order to keep from failing her class,

00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:32.074
"Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test."

00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:37.663
Good. Good. Very good.

00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:40.082
Um, Mr Darko.

00:41:47.715 --> 00:41:50.467
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground, filled with money.

00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:55.431
"She takes the wallet to the address
inside but keeps the money."

00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:59.309
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer. I don't get this.

00:41:59.518 --> 00:42:02.521
Just place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

00:42:02.646 --> 00:42:06.025
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.736
You can't lump things into two categories.

00:42:08.819 --> 00:42:12.489
The lifeline is divided that way.

00:42:12.614 --> 00:42:14.199
Well, life isn't that simple.

00:42:14.408 --> 00:42:18.495
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money?

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:21.331
It has nothing to do with either fear or love.

00:42:21.457 --> 00:42:24.001
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.

00:42:24.209 --> 00:42:26.754
OK. But you're not listening to me.

00:42:26.837 --> 00:42:29.631
There are other things that need
to be taken into account here.

00:42:29.715 --> 00:42:32.676
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.

00:42:32.801 --> 00:42:37.347
You can't lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else.

00:42:37.473 --> 00:42:41.643
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.

00:42:46.648 --> 00:42:48.192
Donald.

00:42:48.317 --> 00:42:51.862
Let me preface this by saying
that your Iowa Test scores

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:55.741
are... intimidating.

00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:01.663
So... let's go over this again.

00:43:01.747 --> 00:43:05.167
What exactly did you say to Mrs Farmer?

00:43:07.586 --> 00:43:09.546
I'll tell you what he said.

00:43:09.671 --> 00:43:13.592
He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus.

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:24.520
These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.

00:43:24.603 --> 00:43:30.317
If there's a vice presidential candidate
worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.072
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:41.036
Kitty...

00:43:41.161 --> 00:43:42.955
Excuse us, please.

00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:51.088
They've suspended him from after-school
activities for the next six months.

00:43:54.091 --> 00:43:58.720
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.

00:43:58.804 --> 00:44:03.267
Rose, our daughters have been on
the dance team together for two years

00:44:03.392 --> 00:44:05.394
and I respect you as a woman.

00:44:05.477 --> 00:44:10.816
But after witnessing your son's
behaviour, I have doubts about your...

00:44:12.526 --> 00:44:15.320
Our paths through life must be righteous.

00:44:15.445 --> 00:44:18.574
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror,

00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:22.369
and pray that your son
doesn't succumb to the path of fear.

00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:32.546
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher Mrs Farmer?

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.382
Yeah.

00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:39.428
OK, my brother told her to shove
a book up her ass today.

00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:43.515
And then my parents just bought him
all this new shit.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.769
I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall in my room.

00:44:50.439 --> 00:44:53.150
'I can show you the way.'

00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:01.533
Yeah.

00:45:05.662 --> 00:45:07.831
- Dr Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

00:45:07.915 --> 00:45:11.668
Um, I know this is gonna sound
kinda weird, but uh...

00:45:11.793 --> 00:45:16.048
do you know anything about time travel?

00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:24.431
Ah! A Wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:29.811
which is theoretically a Wormhole
in space controlled by man.

00:45:32.189 --> 00:45:34.816
So, according to Hawking,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.237
a Wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.323
forjumping between
two distant regions of space time.

00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:43.075
So in order to travel back in time,

00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:46.620
you have to have a big spaceship
that can travel faster than light.

00:45:46.703 --> 00:45:49.873
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a Wormhole.

00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:52.251
The basic principles of time travel are there.

00:45:52.334 --> 00:45:54.419
You've got your vessel and your portal,

00:45:54.544 --> 00:45:57.172
and your vessel can be
just about anything. Probably a spacecraft.

00:45:57.297 --> 00:45:59.967
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:06.056
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so... like futuristic, you know.

00:46:06.848 --> 00:46:11.144
Listen... don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

00:46:11.228 --> 00:46:13.981
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.

00:46:14.064 --> 00:46:17.401
She was a nun many years before that.

00:46:17.526 --> 00:46:22.364
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

00:46:22.489 --> 00:46:25.951
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.

00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:28.287
She started teaching science.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.455
Right here in Middlesex.

00:46:31.415 --> 00:46:33.750
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."

00:46:35.252 --> 00:46:37.296
Roberta Sparrow?

00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:39.464
That's right.

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:41.842
Come on.

00:46:42.843 --> 00:46:44.886
Roberta Sparrow.

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:06.533
Roberta Sparrow...

00:47:08.118 --> 00:47:10.203
Grandma Death.

00:47:11.163 --> 00:47:13.790
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel."

00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:17.461
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?

00:47:17.544 --> 00:47:21.298
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.

00:47:21.423 --> 00:47:23.425
Roberta Sparrow?

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.635
Huh! She wrote a book!

00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:27.929
Grandma Death wrote a book.

00:47:28.722 --> 00:47:30.640
That's a terrible nickname.

00:47:31.475 --> 00:47:33.852
We almost hit her with the car the other day.

00:47:34.436 --> 00:47:38.899
She lives in that piece of crap house
and you know she's loaded.

00:47:39.024 --> 00:47:41.360
- She's...
- You're right.

00:47:41.485 --> 00:47:44.488
She used to be known for her gem collection.

00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:50.619
Kids... used to go up there
and try to steal stuff from her.

00:47:51.328 --> 00:47:53.372
She became a total recluse.

00:47:54.164 --> 00:47:58.585
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:05.967
She was standing in the road, frozen,

00:48:06.093 --> 00:48:10.972
so I got out of the car and
walked over to see if she was OK.

00:48:11.098 --> 00:48:13.517
She leaned over and whispered in my ear.

00:48:13.725 --> 00:48:17.396
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.

00:48:17.479 --> 00:48:20.941
He asked me if I knew about time travel.

00:48:21.024 --> 00:48:25.195
She wrote a book about it,
so it can't be like a coincidence, right?

00:48:28.407 --> 00:48:30.742
Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?

00:48:32.869 --> 00:48:36.206
She said every living creature
on earth dies alone.

00:48:40.377 --> 00:48:42.421
How did that make you feel?

00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:49.136
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.931
She died when I was eight and...

00:48:53.014 --> 00:48:56.601
she crawled underneath the porch.

00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:02.399
To die?

00:49:04.443 --> 00:49:06.528
To be alone.

00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:09.906
Do you feel alone right now?

00:49:15.203 --> 00:49:17.247
L...

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:22.502
I mean, I'd like to believe I'm not,
but I just...

00:49:23.503 --> 00:49:26.381
I've just never seen any proof, so I...

00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:29.009
I just don't debate it any more, you know.

00:49:29.092 --> 00:49:32.262
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over again,

00:49:32.387 --> 00:49:34.764
weighting the pros and cons
and I still wouldn't have any proof,

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.185
so I just... I just don't debate it any more.

00:49:38.268 --> 00:49:40.770
It's absurd.

00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:46.485
The search for God is absurd?

00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:51.239
It is if everyone dies alone.

00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:54.117
Does that scare you?

00:49:57.954 --> 00:50:00.123
I don't want to be alone.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:15.889
And so, his tapes have made me realise

00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:21.144
that for the last 39 years I have been
a prisoner of my own fear.

00:50:21.895 --> 00:50:24.022
Fear?

00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:27.400
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.

00:50:28.276 --> 00:50:30.487
I can't believe he's single.

00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:36.076
'It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.

00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:40.914
'Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines,
water dripping off his glasses.

00:50:40.997 --> 00:50:44.167
'He's gotta be thinking,
"What went wrong tonight?"

00:50:44.918 --> 00:50:47.504
'Here's the kick.'

00:50:47.629 --> 00:50:50.048
'And it's no good.'

00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:53.343
We need a quarterback. And a miracle.

00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:55.512
We need to go for a safety.

00:50:57.389 --> 00:51:00.684
'Mark Rypien certainly
has some big shoes to fill.

00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:02.852
'He sure does.'

You guys want anything?

00:51:15.991 --> 00:51:17.951
I'm gonna get a beer.

00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:44.811
'Good evening, ladies and ghouls.

00:51:44.936 --> 00:51:47.564

What if you could go back in time

and take all the pain and darkness
and replace it with something better?

00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:27.831
- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset

00:53:27.956 --> 00:53:31.960
or the Grand Canyon. Things
that remind you how beautiful...

00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:35.088
You know, we've been going together
for like, two weeks.

00:53:35.171 --> 00:53:36.715
Yeah.

00:53:38.883 --> 00:53:40.844
Well, I uh...

Uh...

00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:55.942
- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...

00:53:56.067 --> 00:54:02.157
I just want it to be at a time when it...

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.202
- When what?
- When it reminds me... just...

00:54:07.871 --> 00:54:10.999
When it reminds you how beautiful
the world can be?

00:54:11.124 --> 00:54:12.834
Yeah.

00:54:13.918 --> 00:54:17.547
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

00:54:24.471 --> 00:54:28.224
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:32.645
We both felt it was time for us
to come in and discuss...

00:54:32.854 --> 00:54:35.523
What I think is going on with your son?

00:54:35.648 --> 00:54:37.859
Yes.

00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:41.404
Um... Well, he's uh...

00:54:42.864 --> 00:54:47.035
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

00:54:47.118 --> 00:54:49.287
for insulting his gym teacher.

00:54:49.412 --> 00:54:54.000
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...

00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:58.296
Rose, let me just lay out
what I believe is happening here.

00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:04.761
Bonnie's aggressive behaviour,

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:09.140
his increased detachment from reality,

00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:13.269
seem to stem from his inability to cope

00:55:13.353 --> 00:55:17.524
with the forces in the world
that he perceives to be threatening.

00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:25.114
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?

00:55:29.869 --> 00:55:32.163
Frank?

00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:34.123
The giant bunny rabbit.

00:55:34.916 --> 00:55:36.793
What?

00:55:40.797 --> 00:55:46.427
I don't recall him
ever having mentioned a rabbit.

00:55:46.511 --> 00:55:51.516
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:59.065
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.319
What can we do?

00:56:03.444 --> 00:56:07.490
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.

00:56:09.659 --> 00:56:11.995
And increase his medication.

00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:24.173
Whatever will help him, really,
because that's why we're here.

00:56:24.257 --> 00:56:29.345
We just would like him
to experience some... relief.

00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:34.267
So if you think that
more medication will do that,

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:38.688
then I think we should give it a try.

00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:53.494
Donnie Darko.

00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:58.416
I know.

00:57:07.634 --> 00:57:10.595
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.765
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
I said good morning!

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.892
Good morning.

00:57:15.975 --> 00:57:18.311
Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

00:57:18.394 --> 00:57:23.566
But I can still sense some students
who are afraid to say good morning.

00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:26.069
Good morning!

00:57:26.194 --> 00:57:28.029
That's what I like to hear!

00:57:28.154 --> 00:57:31.115
Entirely too many young men and women today

00:57:31.199 --> 00:57:34.243
are completely paralysed by their fears.

00:57:34.452 --> 00:57:39.165
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.335
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

00:57:43.252 --> 00:57:47.298
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story today.

00:57:47.423 --> 00:57:49.550
It's a heartbreakingly sad story

00:57:49.634 --> 00:57:53.888
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed

00:57:53.972 --> 00:57:56.182
by these instruments of fear.

00:57:56.307 --> 00:58:01.646
A young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

00:58:02.438 --> 00:58:04.774
His name was Frank.

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:13.950
Um, my stepsister... I sometimes
worry that she eats too much.

00:58:14.033 --> 00:58:16.703
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.

00:58:16.828 --> 00:58:21.207
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:23.459
What do I do to learn how to fight?

00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:26.462
"What do I do to learn how to fight?"

00:58:26.546 --> 00:58:30.925
Son, violence is a product of fear.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:34.178
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.

00:58:34.303 --> 00:58:36.639
- Get yourself up here.
- OK.

00:58:36.764 --> 00:58:38.766
All right.

00:58:40.893 --> 00:58:43.980
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:58:44.105 --> 00:58:47.066
Um, how much are they paying you to be here?

00:58:48.651 --> 00:58:50.153
Excuse me?

00:58:52.405 --> 00:58:53.990
What is your name, son?

00:58:54.115 --> 00:58:55.908
Gerald.

00:58:56.034 --> 00:58:59.078
Gerald, I think you're afraid.

00:58:59.203 --> 00:59:04.625
Are you telling us this so we buy your
book? It's the worst advice I heard.

00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:06.544
You see how sad this is?

00:59:06.669 --> 00:59:12.341
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell
her to get off the couch and exercise.

00:59:12.467 --> 00:59:15.678
No-one knows what to do when they grow up.

00:59:15.803 --> 00:59:19.390
It takes a while to find that out. Right, Jim?

00:59:19.515 --> 00:59:21.476
And you.

00:59:21.559 --> 00:59:23.644
Yeah, you.

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.731
You sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:30.193
Maybe you should lift weights
or take a karate lesson.

00:59:30.318 --> 00:59:33.071
Next time he tries to do it,
you kick him in the balls.

00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:36.199
Son.

00:59:36.324 --> 00:59:38.159
Do you see this?

00:59:38.284 --> 00:59:41.704
This is an anger prisoner. A textbook example.

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:43.331
You see the fear, people?

00:59:43.456 --> 00:59:46.125
This boy is scared to death of the truth.

00:59:46.334 --> 00:59:49.587
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:53.800
but I believe you are a very troubled
and confused young man.

00:59:53.883 --> 00:59:57.095
I believe, you were searching
for the answers in the wrong places.

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:02.100
You're right, actually. I am pretty
troubled and pretty confused.

01:00:02.183 --> 01:00:05.144
And I'm afraid. Really afraid. Really afraid.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:08.689
But I think you're the fucking Antichrist.

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:14.612
Get him out of here! Who do you think you are?

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:23.621
It's amazing.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:28.084
The man thinks he's telling the truth.
Everything he says is just a fucking lie.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:30.419
Everything he says.

01:00:30.503 --> 01:00:33.631
Everyone thinks he's so rad. He's such a chud.

01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:36.259
- Everything he does...
- Are you OK?

01:00:40.096 --> 01:00:43.099
- Yeah...
- Sit down. Calm down.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:50.898
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:53.151
Who?

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:00.741
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:02.743
What is this?

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:04.954
She wrote it.

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:15.756
I'm...

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:17.592
I've been seeing stuff.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:20.469
Like a lot of really messed-up stuff.

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:26.434
Chapters in there describe what
I've seen. It can't just be a coincidence.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:33.524
Each vessel travels
along a vector through space time,

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.568
along its centre of gravity.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.195
Like a spear?

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:42.575
- I beg your pardon?
- A spear coming out of your chest.

01:01:43.576 --> 01:01:46.287
Um... sure, yeah.

01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:48.956
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.251
it's got to find a portal,
in this case a Wormhole...

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:57.924
Could these portals just appear
anywhere, any time?

01:01:58.007 --> 01:02:00.384
I think that's highly unlikely.

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:04.096
What you're talking about is an act of God.

01:02:04.222 --> 01:02:06.641
If God controls time,
then all time's pre-decided.

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:12.897
- I'm not following you.
- Every living thing has a set path.

01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:15.942
And if you could see your path or channel,

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:21.447
you could see into the future.
Like... a form of time travel.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.325
You're contradicting yourself, Donnie.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:28.871
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,

01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:32.959
then we would be given a choice
to betray our chosen destinies.

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:35.211
The fact that this choice exists

01:02:35.294 --> 01:02:39.215
would make all pre-formed destiny come to an end.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.509
Not if you travel within God's channel.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:50.601
Um... I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:56.232
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:58.734
OK.

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.957
'Now you know where he lives.'

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.628
And they grow out of our chest...

01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:01.630
solar plexus?

01:04:01.756 --> 01:04:06.218
Like she described in the book.
The way they moved and smelled...

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:08.304
Like they're workers.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:11.599
Assigned to each one of us.

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:14.185
They just... They're like liquid.

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:20.024
I followed it... into my parents' bedroom.

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:23.319
What did you find?

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.825
Nothing.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:36.248
So we call them lMGs.

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:38.376
Infant Memory Generators.

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:43.631
So you buy the glasses for an infant
and they wear them when they sleep.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:48.177
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs,

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:51.389
and each one is of something
peaceful or beautiful,

01:04:51.472 --> 01:04:53.974
whatever the parents want to put inside.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.977
What effect would this have on an infant?

01:04:57.853 --> 01:05:00.898
Well, nobody remembers their infancy.

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:03.359
Anyone who says they do is lying.

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:06.070
We think this'll develop memory earlier in life.

01:05:06.195 --> 01:05:07.238
Yeah.

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:13.202
Did you consider that darkness is part
of infants' natural development?

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:18.874
No.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:23.129
Yeah.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:25.673
What if the parents put in pictures of Satan?

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:27.925
Dead people, crap like that.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:30.511
Is that what you'd show your kids?

01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:37.351
Uh, well, I mean... didn't your dad, like,
stab your mum?

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:43.858
Ha ha ha ha!

01:05:46.569 --> 01:05:48.446
Get out.

01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:51.574
Gretchen!

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:53.576
Gretchen. Gretchen.

01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:55.744
I'm sorry about those guys.

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:26.859
- Two for "Evil Dead," please.
- Two dollars.

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:18.035
Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?

01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:26.126
Why are you wearing that stupid man's suit?

01:07:35.553 --> 01:07:38.347
Take it off.

01:07:57.366 --> 01:08:00.411
What happened to your eye?

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:08.335
I'm so sorry.

01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:17.761
Why do they call you Frank?

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.515
It's the name of my father

01:08:23.601 --> 01:08:26.395
and his father before me.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.234
Frank?

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:37.865
When's this gonna stop?

01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:40.534
You should already know that.

01:08:44.079 --> 01:08:46.373
I want you to watch the movie screen.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.836
There's something I want to show you.

01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:01.805
Have you ever seen a portal?

01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:22.785
Burn it to the ground.

01:10:36.859 --> 01:10:40.696
OK. Now, girls, I want you to concentrate.

01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:43.198
Failure is not an option.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:46.785
Bethany, if you feel the need to vomit up there,

01:10:46.869 --> 01:10:49.872
- just swallow it.
- OK.

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:53.041
Hey, you guys. Good luck out there.

01:11:09.725 --> 01:11:11.769
Get off the stage, Cherita!

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.025
You suck!

01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:27.618
Hold on.

01:11:32.039 --> 01:11:34.166
That was really something.

01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:36.919
Thank you, Cherita Chen, with "Autumn Angel."

01:11:38.045 --> 01:11:40.714
Now the moment we've all been waiting for.

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:43.842
It is my distinct pleasure to introduce to you

01:11:43.926 --> 01:11:46.470
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:50.057
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer and Joanie James.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.851
They are... Sparkle Motion.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:39.374
All right! Sparkle Motion!

01:14:46.775 --> 01:14:49.236
How long was I asleep for?

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:52.239
Whole movie.

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:05.335
Captain, looks like we got
another room back here.

01:15:06.962 --> 01:15:10.841
'The blaze was extinguished sometime after 8pm.

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:15.971
'Firefighters discovered what has
been called a "kiddie porn dungeon."

01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:20.475
'Cunningham, who has become
a celebrity for his books and tapes,

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.185
'was arrested this morning...'

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:24.312
Oh, my God!

01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:29.776
'Arson has not been ruled out
as part of the cause of the fire.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:33.613
'A group of Cunning Vision employees...'

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:36.199
Dad played golf with that guy.

01:15:36.283 --> 01:15:40.495
'...denied alleged links to a child
pornography publishing circuit.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:44.666
'In a vicious statement, Cunningham
attacked fire department officials,

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.168
'claiming a vast conspiracy.'

01:15:47.586 --> 01:15:52.257
Karen, we don't think the
methods you've used are appropriate.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.137
What exactly about my methods
do you find inappropriate?

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.641
I don't have time to get
into a debate about this, Karen.

01:16:01.767 --> 01:16:04.519
I believe I've made myself clear.

01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:06.897
You call this clarity?

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:11.568
You don't have a clue what it's like
to communicate with these kids.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:15.530
And we are losing them to apathy.

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:20.994
To this prescribed nonsense.

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:23.705
They're slipping away.

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.875
I am sorry that you have failed.

01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:31.046
If you'll excuse me, I have another appointment.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.300
You can finish out the week.

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:44.601
Fuck!

01:17:04.246 --> 01:17:06.331
Good afternoon.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:10.877
It gives me great pleasure to
announce that the school dance team

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:15.340
has been invited to perform
on Ed McMahon's "Star Search '88"

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:18.135
in Los Angeles, California.

01:17:52.502 --> 01:17:54.504
No, it was ridiculous...

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:56.631
I'll call you back.

01:17:57.757 --> 01:18:00.510
- Rose.
- Kitty.

01:18:01.303 --> 01:18:06.183
I'm sure you're aware of the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:09.644
I know, I saw it on TV.
Something about a kiddie porn...

01:18:09.853 --> 01:18:13.190
Oh, please! Don't use those words!

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:18.028
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:23.074
I am going to spearhead the
Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:29.164
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:33.418
The girls are scheduled to leave
for Los Angeles in the morning.

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:37.797
As their coach, I was the
obvious choice to chaperone them...

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:40.759
But now you can't go.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.510
- Yes.
- Hm.

01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:45.305
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.432
I would never dream of asking you.

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:50.769
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:55.065
I don't know, Kitty.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:58.151
It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.

01:18:58.276 --> 01:19:02.489
Rose, I don't know if you realise

01:19:02.614 --> 01:19:06.284
what an opportunity this is for our daughters.

01:19:06.368 --> 01:19:11.414
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

01:19:12.082 --> 01:19:14.918
I made her lead dancer.

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:20.632
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:53.373
Elizabeth will be in charge.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:56.042
She'll drive you to therapy.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:20:01.172
And if you need anything, promise me
you will call Dr Thurman.

01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:15.645
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.569
It feels wonderful.

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:06.905
What do I tell the others
when they ask about you?

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.743
Tell them everything is gonna be just fine.

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:16.289
What's "cellar door"?

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:19.709
This famous linguist once said

01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:23.505
that of all the phrases in the English language,

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:27.926
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history,

01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:31.638
that "cellar door" is the most beautiful.

01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:36.559
"Cellar door"?

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:11.886
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.266
Shut up!

01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:33.324
- I want to talk about your past today.
- No.

01:22:33.408 --> 01:22:37.996
I want to talk about you and your parents.

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:41.875
They didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas.

01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:45.462
What did you want for Christmas that year?

01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:47.964
Hungry Hungry Hippos-

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:55.555
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

01:22:56.139 --> 01:22:57.640
Regret.

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:01.019
What else makes you feel regret?

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.814
That I did it again.

01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:07.901
You did it again?

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:13.072
I flooded my school and I
burned down that pervert's house.

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:19.078
I only have a few days before they catch me.

01:23:19.204 --> 01:23:21.581
Did Frank tell you to do these things?

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:24.876
I have to obey him. He saved my life.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.339
I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone,

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.508
and then...

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:36.054
and then I won't be able to figure out
what this is all about.

01:23:36.137 --> 01:23:39.599
I won't be able to know his master plan.

01:23:40.475 --> 01:23:43.394
Do you mean God's master plan?

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:47.232
Do you now believe in God?

01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:50.068
I have the power to build a time machine.

01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:52.070
How is that possible?

01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:59.118
How is time travel possible, Donnie?

01:23:59.202 --> 01:24:01.454
Time's up, Frank said.

01:24:01.579 --> 01:24:03.790
When is this going to happen?

01:24:03.915 --> 01:24:05.917
Soon.

01:24:07.502 --> 01:24:10.880
Soon.

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:28.147
What is going to happen?

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:34.028
Frank is gonna kill.

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:36.739
Who is he going to kill?

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:43.663
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him right now!

01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:51.212
The sky is going to open up.

01:24:57.677 --> 01:25:02.265
If the sky were to suddenly open up,
there would be no law.

01:25:02.348 --> 01:25:04.267
There would be no rule.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:07.395
There would only be you and your memories.

01:25:07.562 --> 01:25:12.525
The choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

01:25:13.443 --> 01:25:15.486
If this world were to end,

01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:19.616
there would only be you and him.

01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:21.701
And no-one else.

01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:02.033
Hey.

01:26:02.116 --> 01:26:04.577
I got in.

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.916
I am going to Harvard.

01:26:12.293 --> 01:26:14.420
We should totally throw a party.

01:26:14.545 --> 01:26:19.050
Mum and Dad are gone. It's
Halloween. We could get away with it.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:22.512
OK, but it has to be small, all right?

01:26:25.765 --> 01:26:27.642
Happy Halloween!

01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:40.530
Beelzebub!

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:59.424
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

01:26:59.507 --> 01:27:01.801
I stole four beers from my dad.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:05.513
- We got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:25.241
'Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:29.620
It is extremely important that you
call me as soon as you hear this.

01:27:29.704 --> 01:27:31.831
Thank you.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.839
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:27:43.593 --> 01:27:45.094
You OK?

01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:49.891
Yeah. My mum's gone.

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:53.186
You wanna come in?

01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:55.354
Yeah.

01:28:16.918 --> 01:28:21.714
I don't know. She...
She didn't leave a note and...

01:28:21.798 --> 01:28:24.050
the house was all messed up.

01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:26.260
But you're OK?

01:28:29.764 --> 01:28:31.849
Did you call the cops?

01:28:32.809 --> 01:28:37.855
Yeah. They said I should leave
the house and go to a safe place.

01:28:40.274 --> 01:28:44.987
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful is happening and...

01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:50.201
It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:04.382
I guess some people are just
born with tragedy in their blood.

01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:13.307
- Have you guys seen Frank?
- No, I think they went on a beer run.

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:17.478
'If you're there, pick up.

01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:21.607
'Hello. Good news.
The girls got three and a half stars

01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:24.318
'and get to come back for the quarterfinals.

01:29:24.402 --> 01:29:27.905
'Samantha was amazing. Anyway...

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:31.117
We'll take the red-eye back tonight, and we...

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.327
Mum, the plane's about to leave.

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:37.290
We'll take the red-eye
and should arrive around 8.30.

01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:41.711
Um... I hope everything's all right.

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:44.130
I love you. Bye.

01:31:30.111 --> 01:31:32.196
'Cellar door.'

01:31:39.203 --> 01:31:42.164
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:45.710
- Just tell me.
- Look, we gotta go.

01:31:45.793 --> 01:31:49.880
- We have to see Grandma Death.
- Is this about the book?

01:31:49.964 --> 01:31:54.385
No, it's Frank. Time is running out. We gotta go.

01:32:24.957 --> 01:32:27.710
Roberta Sparrow.

01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:30.880
Grandma Death.

01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:43.059
Donnie, nobody's here. Let's forget about it.

01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:47.021
Cellar door.

01:32:47.104 --> 01:32:48.981
What?

01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:53.671
Donnie!

01:33:56.382 --> 01:33:58.926
Donnie!

01:33:59.009 --> 01:34:01.095
Why the fuck are you here?

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.848
Oh, my God.

01:34:05.599 --> 01:34:08.602
- You're dead!
- What do we do with him?

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:10.729
Leave him alone!

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:16.569
Don't fucking move.

01:34:18.529 --> 01:34:21.157
Oh, fuck! Aargh!

01:34:25.786 --> 01:34:28.873
There's a car!

01:34:28.998 --> 01:34:31.792
Get the hell out of here! Now!

01:34:32.585 --> 01:34:35.212
Seth, there's a car coming! Let's go!

01:34:35.296 --> 01:34:38.591
- I have a bigger knife now.
- God!

01:34:40.134 --> 01:34:42.970
Let's go! Here come the cops!

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.101
Did you call the fucking cops?

01:34:49.185 --> 01:34:51.979
- Deus ex machine.
- What did you say?

01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:57.026
- What the fuck did you say?
- Our saviour.

01:35:01.614 --> 01:35:03.782
Donnie!

01:35:15.753 --> 01:35:17.838
Gretchen?

01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:24.386
Gretchen?

01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:28.307
Gretchen.

01:35:31.143 --> 01:35:33.270
Wake up, Gretchen.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.397
Frank.

01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:38.359
- Wake up.
- What did you do?

01:35:40.027 --> 01:35:42.863
Gretchen, wake up. Wake up.

01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:44.990
Wake up.

01:35:46.992 --> 01:35:49.119
Gretchen?

01:35:49.245 --> 01:35:51.247
Gretchen.

01:35:51.372 --> 01:35:53.832
What the fuck did you do, man?

01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:57.419
You killed her, Frank!

01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:02.549
Is she dead?

01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:13.018
What were you guys doing in the road?

01:36:13.102 --> 01:36:15.229
What were you thinking?
