After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:19.081
Fists with your toes?

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:24.003
I know. It sounds crazy. Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:28.257
Yes, sir! Better than a shower

OK.

Any of these things ring a bell?

Actually, I was thinking more of
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie,

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.387
and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:43.642
Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

You're making me feel

Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.308
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:26.894
Is Daddy coming home with you?

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.484
Well, we'll see what Santa

<i>No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.</i>

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.046
He probably didn't have time

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.092
It might be a good idea to make up
the spare bedroom, just in case.

OK... Argyle. What do we do now?

00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:06.660
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.
It's my first time driving a limo.

00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:09.663
That's OK. It's my first time riding in one.

00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:12.583
Relax. We got everything in this mug, man.

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:15.920
Look at this - CD, CB, TV,

00:06:16.003 --> 00:06:18.505
telephone, full bar, VHS.

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:24.845
If your friend's hot to trot, I know
a few mama bears we can hook up with.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.058
- Or is he married?
- He's married.

Oh, sorry about that. It's the girl's day off.

Your lady live out here?

00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:42.112
About the past six months.

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:44.448
Meaning you still live in New York?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.452
You always ask this many questions, Argyle?

00:06:48.535 --> 00:06:53.123
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

00:06:53.207 --> 00:06:56.502
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

00:06:56.585 --> 00:07:00.422
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up?!

00:07:03.342 --> 00:07:07.471
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:12.476
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:15.229
So, why didn't you come?

00:07:17.898 --> 00:07:21.360
Well? Why didn't you come with her?
What's up?

00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:23.278
Because I'm a New York cop.

You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here,

so why bother to pack, right?

Of course he has.

She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

Later.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.250
Show him. Are you embarrassed?
It's a token of appreciation

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:55.754
for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

00:13:55.837 --> 00:13:58.340
I'm sure I'll see it later.

00:13:58.423 --> 00:14:01.426

Sure.

00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:22.906
You have to forgive Ellis.
He gets very depressed this time of year.

00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:26.243
He thought <i>he</i> was
God's greatest gift, you know?

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:28.620
I know the type.

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:31.748
I think he's got his eye on you.

00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:35.669
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:38.839
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast

00:14:38.922 --> 00:14:41.675
I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:44.261
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.599
- He said I could bunk with him.
- Cappy retired, huh? Where's he live?

00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:52.894
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

00:14:53.228 --> 00:14:55.564
- Huh?
- Pomona.

00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:57.524
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

00:14:58.442 --> 00:15:00.777
You'll be in the car half the time.

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:05.782
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

00:15:05.866 --> 00:15:08.493
It's not huge or anything, but...

00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:12.038
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

00:15:13.248 --> 00:15:16.168
They would, huh?

00:15:18.128 --> 00:15:20.422
I would, too.

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:23.550
<i>(woman)</i> Ooh!

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:25.051
Sorry.

00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:34.561
I missed you.

00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:43.820
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:47.115
Except maybe when you're signing cheques?

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:50.076
Since when did you start using Ms Gennero?

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:56.166
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

00:15:56.249 --> 00:15:58.335
You <i>are</i> a married woman.

00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:03.173
- This conversation again?
- We never finished this conversation.

00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:08.512
- I had an opportunity. I had to take it.
- No matter what it did to our marriage.

00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:12.724
- It changed your idea of our marriage.
- You have no clue what my idea...

00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:16.394
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:18.271
<i>(knocking)</i> Ms Gennero, I...

00:16:19.981 --> 00:16:21.691

Hi.

00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:29.574
Mr Takagi is looking for you.
He wants you to say something to the troops.

00:16:29.658 --> 00:16:30.450
Thank you.

Speech time.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.543
Be back in a few minutes.

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:52.389
That was great, John.

00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:55.475
Good job. Very mature.

00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:50.238
So Kareem rebounds. Feeds Worthy

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:52.866
then back to Worthy.

00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:54.784
Boom! Two points.

00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.206

where is Mr Takagi?

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:39.082
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,

It's a pleasure to meet you.

John Phillips, London.

Oh, that's beautiful.

00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:09.482
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:14.320

Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:24.247
Contrary to what you people may think,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.458
we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:32.171
I believe you. I read the article in <i>Forbes.</i>

00:28:34.215 --> 00:28:36.300
Mr Takagi...

00:28:37.301 --> 00:28:41.055
I could talk about industrialisation
and men's fashions all day,

00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:43.182
but I'm afraid work must intrude,

00:28:43.266 --> 00:28:47.103
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

00:28:47.186 --> 00:28:50.106
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions.

00:28:59.615 --> 00:29:01.409
I don't have that code.

00:29:02.451 --> 00:29:06.080
You broke in here to access our computer?

00:29:06.163 --> 00:29:09.417
Any information you get,
when Tokyo wake up, they'll change it.

You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

Sit... down!

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.936
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

00:29:33.274 --> 00:29:35.818
But I need the code key

00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:40.281
because I <i>am</i> interested in the $640 million

00:29:40.364 --> 00:29:44.785
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault

00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:48.497
and the computer controls the vault.

00:29:49.749 --> 00:29:52.043
You want money?

00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:54.503
What kind of terrorists are you?

00:29:57.798 --> 00:30:00.259
Who said we were terrorists?

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.573
The bonds represent, at most,

00:30:22.656 --> 00:30:26.452
ten days' operating capital
for your parent organisation.

00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:29.872
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

00:30:29.955 --> 00:30:30.998
Now...

00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:37.171
the code, please.

00:30:38.464 --> 00:30:41.675
It's useless to you.
There are seven safeguards on our vault.

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:44.428
The code key's only one.
You won't get it open.

00:30:44.512 --> 00:30:47.848
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.

00:30:47.932 --> 00:30:51.894
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

00:30:56.482 --> 00:31:00.152
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:04.073
It would be a shame to ruin it.

00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:08.661
I'm going to count to three.

00:31:09.703 --> 00:31:12.665
There will not be a four.

00:31:13.165 --> 00:31:15.418

- three.
- I don't know it.

00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:29.056
Get on a jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.766
You'll have to kill me.

00:31:31.392 --> 00:31:32.143
OK.

00:31:36.188 --> 00:31:37.606
We do it the hard way.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.692
Tony, dispose of that.

00:31:39.775 --> 00:31:43.112

See to Heinrich.

00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:14.977

you can break the code?

Uli.

30 minutes to break the code,

two and a half hours

00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:34.765
The seventh lock, however,
is out of my hands.

00:33:57.454 --> 00:33:58.789
I'm sorry?

00:33:58.872 --> 00:34:02.334
The seventh lock... the electromagnetic seal.

00:34:02.418 --> 00:34:04.795

on a bulletin board.</i>

00:59:04.919 --> 00:59:07.463
I figured since I waxed Tony,
Marco and his friend,

00:59:07.546 --> 00:59:12.384
you and Karl and Franco might be lonely
so I wanted to give you a call.

00:59:12.468 --> 00:59:16.013
<i>(Karl)</i> How does he know so much about us?

00:59:16.097 --> 00:59:18.599
That's very kind of you.

00:59:18.682 --> 00:59:22.269
<i>I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.</i>

00:59:22.353 --> 00:59:25.940
You are troublesome
for a security guard.

00:59:26.023 --> 00:59:28.818
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

00:59:28.901 --> 00:59:34.532
Would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?

00:59:36.826 --> 00:59:39.203
Mm, these are very bad for you.

00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:43.958
- Who are you, then?
- Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:47.461
The monkey in the wrench,
the pain in the ass.

00:59:50.172 --> 00:59:51.590
Whoa!

00:59:52.633 --> 00:59:55.094
Check on all the others. Don't use the radio.

00:59:55.177 --> 00:59:59.348
See if he's lying about Marco
and find out if anyone else is missing.

01:00:02.977 --> 01:00:05.062
Mr Mystery Guest...

01:00:06.147 --> 01:00:07.898
are you still there?

01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:13.112
Yeah, I'm still here, unless you
wanna open the front door for me.

01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:15.114
No, I'm afraid not,

01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:17.992
but you have me at a loss.

01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:19.827
You know my name, but who are you?

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:24.081
<i>Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?</i>

01:00:24.165 --> 01:00:27.334
<i>Another orphan of a bankrupt culture</i>

01:00:27.418 --> 01:00:31.755
<i>who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?</i>

01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:37.136
I was always partial to Roy Rogers, actually.
I liked those sequinned shirts.

01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:40.472
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

01:00:43.601 --> 01:00:45.936
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.817
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:53.694
<i>(man)</i> I don't have the new pages.

01:00:53.777 --> 01:00:56.030
Harvey, keep your pants on.

01:00:56.113 --> 01:00:57.865
Sam, I'm begging you.

01:00:57.948 --> 01:01:01.160
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

01:01:01.243 --> 01:01:03.078
I won't sit on this!

01:01:03.162 --> 01:01:05.956
This is my story! I'm going out there!

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.960
Look, Sam. Tell you what.
You don't give me a truck, I'll steal a truck.

01:01:10.044 --> 01:01:12.463
<i>- (Harvey)</i> Give us a break, Thornburg.
- Eat it, Harvey!

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:15.132
..four, three, two,

01:01:15.216 --> 01:01:16.550
one.

01:01:16.634 --> 01:01:18.969
Harvey, we're on the air.

01:01:22.681 --> 01:01:25.809
Good evening. This is Harvey Johnson.

01:01:26.644 --> 01:01:30.439
And I'm Gail Wallens.
This is <i>Nightline News at Ten.</i>

01:01:30.522 --> 01:01:33.317
Our top stories on this Christmas Eve...

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.570
Take truck number five and get outta here.

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:47.790
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

01:01:47.873 --> 01:01:50.167
The other man was Heinrich,

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:52.795
and his bag is missing.

01:01:54.296 --> 01:01:56.465
He had the detonator.

01:02:00.678 --> 01:02:02.263
Theo.

01:02:02.346 --> 01:02:03.389
<i>Theo.</i>

01:02:03.597 --> 01:02:05.015
Yo!

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:08.769
<i>We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?</i>

01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:14.400
- Three down, four to go.
- Then don't waste time talking to me.

01:02:14.483 --> 01:02:17.444
This is Sergeant Al Powell
of the LA Police Department.

01:02:17.528 --> 01:02:22.574
If the person who radioed can hear me,
acknowledge this transmission.

01:02:22.658 --> 01:02:23.701
I say again,

01:02:23.784 --> 01:02:27.121
if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,

01:02:27.204 --> 01:02:29.665
acknowledge this transmission!

01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:36.588
I read you, pal. You the guy in the car?

01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:38.632
What's left of him.

01:02:38.716 --> 01:02:42.177
<i>- Can you identify yourself?</i>
- Not now. Maybe later.

01:02:42.261 --> 01:02:46.348
This is a party line.
The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.

01:02:46.432 --> 01:02:49.893
Here's the deal. You got 30 or so
hostages on the 30th floor.

01:02:49.977 --> 01:02:51.395
<i>The leader's name is Hans.</i>

01:02:51.478 --> 01:02:54.148
We have to shut him up.
He's telling them everything!

01:02:54.231 --> 01:02:56.317
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.863
He can waste as much time as he likes
but we <i>must</i> find the bag.

01:03:00.946 --> 01:03:04.408
<i>- (McClane) They have a freakin' arsenal here.</i>
- We must have the detonators.

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:09.580
<i>They got missiles and enough plastic
explosives to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

01:03:09.663 --> 01:03:12.499
They're down to nine,
counting the skydiver you met.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:17.921
These guys are mostly European,
judging by their clothing labels, and...

01:03:23.844 --> 01:03:25.387
cigarettes.

01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:28.015
They're well-financed and very slick.

01:03:28.098 --> 01:03:29.767
How do you know that?

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.602
I've seen enough phoney IDs

01:03:31.685 --> 01:03:35.522
to recognise the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

01:03:37.816 --> 01:03:40.235
Add all that up, I don't know what it means,

01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:43.906
but you got some bad-ass perpetrators
and they're here to stay.

01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:50.454
I hear you, partner. LA's finest are on it,
so light 'em if you got 'em.

01:03:50.537 --> 01:03:53.332
Way ahead of you, partner.

01:03:53.874 --> 01:03:56.001
<i>So what do I call you?</i>

01:03:57.544 --> 01:03:58.629
Call me...

01:04:00.506 --> 01:04:01.340
Roy.

01:04:01.423 --> 01:04:06.428
Listen up, Roy, if you think of anything else,
don't be shy, OK?

01:04:06.512 --> 01:04:10.474
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job. Understand?

01:04:10.557 --> 01:04:12.851
<i>(McClane) They're all yours, Al.</i>

01:04:30.327 --> 01:04:32.579
Who's talking to 'em?

01:04:32.663 --> 01:04:35.707
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:40.212
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?
What do these pricks want?

01:04:40.295 --> 01:04:44.550
If you mean the terrorists,
we haven't heard from them.

01:04:44.633 --> 01:04:47.469
Who have you been talking to?

01:04:47.553 --> 01:04:50.431
We don't know. He won't give us his name.

01:04:50.514 --> 01:04:53.100
But he appears to be the one who phoned.

01:04:53.183 --> 01:04:56.478
He's killed one terrorist
and claims he capped off two others.

01:04:56.562 --> 01:04:58.605
He claims?

01:04:58.689 --> 01:05:02.526
Powell, has it occurred to you
he could be one of the terrorists,

01:05:02.609 --> 01:05:04.361
or some nutcase in there?

01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:07.531
I don't think so. In fact, I think he's a cop,

01:05:07.614 --> 01:05:10.409
maybe not LAPD,
but he's definitely a badge.

01:05:10.492 --> 01:05:13.745
- How do you know that?
- A hunch. Things he said -

01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:16.623
like being able to spot a phoney ID.

01:05:16.707 --> 01:05:18.792
Jesus Christ, Powell!

01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:21.378
He could be a bartender for all we know!

01:05:21.462 --> 01:05:23.839
TV's here.

01:05:23.922 --> 01:05:25.549
Oh, shit.

01:05:25.632 --> 01:05:27.301
<i>(horns blare)</i>

01:05:42.566 --> 01:05:46.487
- I have a request.
- What idiot put you in charge?

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.530
You did...

01:05:48.614 --> 01:05:53.785
when you murdered my boss.
Now everybody's looking to me.

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:58.999
Personally, I'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

01:06:06.965 --> 01:06:08.300
Go on.

01:06:08.383 --> 01:06:10.344
We have a pregnant woman.

01:06:10.427 --> 01:06:13.347
Relax. She's not due for a couple of weeks,

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:16.600
but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

01:06:16.683 --> 01:06:21.855
So I would like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

01:06:21.939 --> 01:06:24.858
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:26.735
Good enough.

01:06:26.818 --> 01:06:32.491
And unless you like it messy, I'd start
bringing us in groups to the bathroom.

01:06:32.574 --> 01:06:36.161
Yes. You're right. It will be done.

01:06:36.828 --> 01:06:40.207
Was there something else?

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.292
No, thank you.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.010
Mr Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?

01:06:52.094 --> 01:06:54.221
Gennero.

What's it look like? We're going in.

Going in? That's crazy! There could be

We don't know shit, Powell.

If there's hostages, how come
there are no ransom demands?

If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
you've been talking to on that radio.

01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:48.515
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

01:11:48.598 --> 01:11:51.059
not a creature was stirring, except

01:11:51.142 --> 01:11:55.981
the four assholes coming in the rear
in standard two-by-two cover formation.

We're all set.

01:12:01.069 --> 01:12:03.029
We're ready.

01:12:03.113 --> 01:12:04.447
Kick ass.

01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:05.657
Go!

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.909
Right. Let's do it.

01:12:23.383 --> 01:12:24.801
Take cover!

01:12:25.218 --> 01:12:26.720
They're shooting at 'em.

01:12:26.803 --> 01:12:30.807
- It's panic fire. They can't see anything.
- They're shooting at the lights.

01:12:35.103 --> 01:12:38.648
They're going after the lights. Call them back.

01:12:39.608 --> 01:12:41.026
It's not happening.

01:12:41.109 --> 01:12:42.319
Mike, burn it.

01:12:44.571 --> 01:12:47.032
Don't be impatient.

01:12:47.115 --> 01:12:49.284
<i>Just wound them.</i>

01:12:50.785 --> 01:12:55.332
- Get them back. They're sitting ducks.
- They're almost in.

01:12:55.457 --> 01:12:58.168
Send in the car. Send in the car.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.016
Jesus Christ!

01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:18.897
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.900
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

01:13:25.946 --> 01:13:28.615
The police have themselves an RV.

01:13:33.912 --> 01:13:35.246
Southeast corner.

Let 'em pull back!

Let's see you take this

Geronimo, motherfucker.

It's him.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.333
Holy shit.

- I got it.

Eat your heart out, Channel 5.

<i>(TV) We've had an update on the terrorist
takeover of the Nakatomi building.</i>

<i>Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,
may be this man, Hans Gruber.</i>

<i>A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

Yeah, I'm fine.

There you go. Is the building on fire?

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:59.594
No, but it's gonna need a paint job
and a shitload of screen doors.

01:17:59.677 --> 01:18:02.430
Our spotter said you got two with that blast.

- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

01:18:06.684 --> 01:18:09.354
I don't know who you think you are,

Oh, you're in charge?

01:18:32.502 --> 01:18:34.504
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

<i>From up here it doesn't look

<i>So do a lot of the other guys.</i>

I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see

them or your husband.

What are you going to do?

01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:34.314
I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast.

It's not what I want. It's what I can give you.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:00.006
Look, let's be straight, OK?

01:20:01.257 --> 01:20:04.719
You're not some dumb schmuck
up here to snatch a few purses.

01:20:04.802 --> 01:20:06.429
You're very perceptive.

01:20:06.512 --> 01:20:11.017

They want something.

01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:20.401
I couldn't care less about your politics.
Maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys.

01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:23.404
Maybe it's Northern Ireland.
It's none of my business.

01:20:23.488 --> 01:20:27.033
- You're here to negotiate, right?
- You're amazing.

01:20:27.116 --> 01:20:29.452
You figured this all out already?

Hey, business is business.

01:20:31.746 --> 01:20:34.999
You use a gun, I use a fountain pen.
What's the difference?

01:20:35.083 --> 01:20:37.668
In my terms,
you're here on a hostile takeover.

01:20:37.752 --> 01:20:42.298
You grab us for some greenmail but didn't
expect a poison pill to be running around.

01:20:42.382 --> 01:20:43.758
Am I right?

01:20:43.841 --> 01:20:45.385

Sugar-enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,

01:21:27.176 --> 01:21:30.388
polysorbate 60, and yellow dye number five.

You got any kids back on your ranch?

01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:47.280
Yeah.

01:21:47.363 --> 01:21:48.406
Two.

01:21:48.865 --> 01:21:52.952

Mr Officer John McClane

of the New York Police Department?

01:22:14.891 --> 01:22:17.143
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

01:22:17.226 --> 01:22:19.562
Get a hold of somebody at Dispatch.

01:22:19.645 --> 01:22:24.108
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

My friends call me John,

A very special friend

Hey, John boy.

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.</i>

but you're dragging this out.

01:23:00.603 --> 01:23:04.148
No one gets out of here until these guys
can talk to the LA police.

That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. <i>Capisce?</i>

Ellis, what have you told them?

That we were old friends

01:23:21.707 --> 01:23:23.668
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

01:23:23.751 --> 01:23:25.753
Tell me about it.

01:23:31.634 --> 01:23:33.344

<i>Tell them where the detonators are.</i>

01:23:50.403 --> 01:23:52.280
Yeah, I hear you.

Then you'll give us what we want
and save your friend's life.

01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:20.141
You're not part of this equation.

01:24:20.224 --> 01:24:22.518
Hey, what am I, a Method actor?

01:24:22.602 --> 01:24:25.938
<i>Babe, put away the gun.
This is radio, not television.</i>

01:24:26.022 --> 01:24:29.650
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!
I don't know him!

01:24:29.734 --> 01:24:34.780
Jesus Christ, Ellis! These people
will kill you! Tell them you don't know me!

01:24:34.864 --> 01:24:37.283
<i>How can you say that after all these years?</i>

01:24:37.366 --> 01:24:41.203
John? John?

01:24:49.295 --> 01:24:50.630
<i>(gunshot)</i>

01:24:50.713 --> 01:24:52.715
<i>(screaming)</i>

01:25:00.806 --> 01:25:03.392
<i>(screaming on radio)</i>

01:25:04.602 --> 01:25:06.437
Do you hear that?

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.315
Talk to me! Where are my detonators?

01:25:09.398 --> 01:25:11.942
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

01:25:12.026 --> 01:25:16.447
<i>Sooner or later,
I might get to someone you do care about.</i>

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:19.116
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

01:25:20.326 --> 01:25:22.411
He just let the guy die.

01:25:22.495 --> 01:25:26.707
He gave him up. Give me that headset.
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:30.461
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

01:25:30.544 --> 01:25:32.838
He did everything he could to save him.

01:25:32.922 --> 01:25:36.050
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

01:25:36.133 --> 01:25:38.803
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:42.390
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

01:25:42.473 --> 01:25:46.018
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

01:25:46.102 --> 01:25:49.271
The man is hurting. He is alone, tired,

01:25:49.355 --> 01:25:53.025
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:55.611
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

01:25:55.695 --> 01:25:58.864
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

01:25:58.948 --> 01:26:01.867
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you shovelling?

01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:03.577
You listen to me, Sergeant.

01:26:03.661 --> 01:26:07.289
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

01:26:07.373 --> 01:26:10.584
No, sir. You couldn't drag me away.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.629
<i>(Hans) Attention, police.</i>

01:26:13.713 --> 01:26:15.798
<i>Attention, police.</i>

01:26:15.881 --> 01:26:19.009
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

01:26:19.093 --> 01:26:22.596
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
Who is this?

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.391
This is Hans Gruber.

01:26:25.474 --> 01:26:28.978
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.

01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:30.980
We have no wish for further loss of life.

01:26:31.063 --> 01:26:34.108
What is it you do wish for?

01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:38.446
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

01:26:38.529 --> 01:26:42.199
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.

01:26:42.283 --> 01:26:44.326
Now it can rattle it for me.

01:26:45.745 --> 01:26:49.915
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

01:26:49.999 --> 01:26:53.127
In Northern Ireland,
seven members of the New Provo Front.

01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:57.840
<i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Quebec.</i>

01:26:57.923 --> 01:27:01.886
<i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.</i>

01:27:01.969 --> 01:27:03.471
What the fuck?

01:27:03.554 --> 01:27:05.389
<i>(whispers)</i> Asian Dawn?

01:27:05.473 --> 01:27:07.975
I read about them in <i>Time</i> magazine.

01:27:08.058 --> 01:27:11.979
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

01:27:12.062 --> 01:27:15.274
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

01:27:15.357 --> 01:27:20.029
and they will accompany us in helicopters
to LA International Airport

01:27:20.112 --> 01:27:24.700
where they will be given further instructions.
You have two hours to comply.

01:27:24.784 --> 01:27:28.245
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr Gruber. This is crazy.

01:27:28.329 --> 01:27:32.124
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:34.502
Hello? Hello!

01:27:36.587 --> 01:27:39.757
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.967
Do you think they'll even try?

01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:44.053
Who cares?

01:27:46.472 --> 01:27:48.641
Theo, are we on schedule?

01:27:48.724 --> 01:27:50.643
One more to go, then it's up to you.

01:27:50.726 --> 01:27:54.146
You better be right,
because the last one will take a miracle.

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.815
It's Christmas, Theo.

01:27:55.898 --> 01:27:58.442
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

01:27:58.526 --> 01:28:01.320
and call me when you hit the last lock.

01:28:02.029 --> 01:28:03.072
Karl,

01:28:03.155 --> 01:28:06.826
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

01:28:06.909 --> 01:28:08.994
Fritz is checking the explosives.

01:28:09.078 --> 01:28:11.789
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

01:28:12.748 --> 01:28:14.208
Hey, Powell, you out there?

01:28:15.584 --> 01:28:17.378
I'm here, John. I'm here.

01:28:17.461 --> 01:28:20.965
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:25.052
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

01:28:25.135 --> 01:28:27.137
I hear you.

01:28:32.601 --> 01:28:35.020
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

01:28:35.104 --> 01:28:37.648
<i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>

01:28:38.983 --> 01:28:42.987
Don't ask me. I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:46.740
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

01:28:46.949 --> 01:28:49.618
<i>In my youth. In my youth.</i>

01:28:49.952 --> 01:28:55.040
<i>..and author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage: A Study in Duality."</i>

01:28:55.124 --> 01:28:58.669
<i>Dr Hasseldorf, what can we expect
in the next few hours?</i>

01:28:58.752 --> 01:28:59.545
<i>Well, Gail,</i>

01:28:59.628 --> 01:29:04.550
the hostages should be going through
the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.

01:29:04.633 --> 01:29:06.510
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

01:29:06.594 --> 01:29:08.178
<i>(Hasseldorf)</i> Finland.

01:29:08.262 --> 01:29:11.891
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

01:29:11.974 --> 01:29:16.812
go through a psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.

01:29:16.896 --> 01:29:19.732
<i>A strange sort of trust and bond develops.</i>

01:29:19.815 --> 01:29:24.820
<i>We've had situations where the hostages
have embraced their captors after release</i>

01:29:24.904 --> 01:29:27.114
<i>and even corresponded with them in prison.</i>

01:29:27.448 --> 01:29:30.242
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:33.245
D-a-w-n.

01:29:33.329 --> 01:29:34.830
- Sir?
- Yeah?

01:29:34.914 --> 01:29:36.832
Sir, the FBI is here.

01:29:36.916 --> 01:29:40.711
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

01:29:40.794 --> 01:29:42.129
Hold this.

01:29:42.212 --> 01:29:44.465
Want a breath mint?

01:29:48.469 --> 01:29:50.846
How you doin', man?

01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:53.557
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:56.977
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

01:29:57.061 --> 01:29:58.395
I'm, uh...

01:29:59.813 --> 01:30:03.651
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

01:30:03.734 --> 01:30:05.778
Not any more.

01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:04.086
Hi, there. How you doing?

01:31:07.423 --> 01:31:08.424
Ohh...

01:31:10.050 --> 01:31:13.220
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

01:31:13.303 --> 01:31:14.805
You're one of them.

01:31:14.888 --> 01:31:17.766
No! Don't kill me! Please!

01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:20.310
Don't kill me, please! Please, please!

01:31:20.394 --> 01:31:23.188
Whoa. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:31:23.272 --> 01:31:24.940
I'm not gonna hurt you!

01:31:27.484 --> 01:31:29.111
Oh, God.

01:31:32.573 --> 01:31:35.784
What are you doin' up here?
What were you lookin' for?

01:31:35.868 --> 01:31:38.287
I managed to get out of there and...

01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:41.498
I was just trying to get up on the roof...

01:31:41.582 --> 01:31:44.293
and see if I could signal for help.

01:31:45.794 --> 01:31:47.921
It's through here. Come and help.

01:31:48.005 --> 01:31:51.133
Hold it. Forget the roof.

01:31:51.842 --> 01:31:54.678
Forget the roof. They got people all over it.

01:31:56.096 --> 01:31:58.557
You wanna stay alive, you stay with me.

01:32:01.393 --> 01:32:03.479
The best we can figure it,

01:32:03.562 --> 01:32:07.066
we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages up there,

01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:09.068
probably on the 30th floor,

01:32:09.151 --> 01:32:12.780
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

01:32:12.863 --> 01:32:15.032
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

01:32:15.115 --> 01:32:17.534
Thank you. We'll handle it from here.

01:32:17.618 --> 01:32:20.412
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

01:32:20.496 --> 01:32:23.582
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Such as?

01:32:23.665 --> 01:32:28.545
What about John McClane?
He's the reason we have any information.

01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:32.257
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

01:32:32.341 --> 01:32:34.676
He's inside? Who is he?

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.679
He might be a cop. We're checking on that.

01:32:37.763 --> 01:32:40.432
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

01:32:45.979 --> 01:32:46.814
You smoke?

01:32:48.357 --> 01:32:49.858
Yeah.

01:32:54.571 --> 01:32:55.781
Thanks.

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.538
You don't work for Nakatomi.

01:33:06.834 --> 01:33:09.711
And if you're not one of them...

01:33:11.797 --> 01:33:14.258
I'm a cop from New York.

01:33:15.134 --> 01:33:16.718
New York?

01:33:16.802 --> 01:33:18.720
Yeah.

01:33:18.804 --> 01:33:21.640
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

01:33:21.723 --> 01:33:23.016
Who knew?

01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:35.696
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

01:33:43.036 --> 01:33:45.747
I'm John McClane.

01:33:45.831 --> 01:33:47.332
You're, uh...

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:50.377
Clay.

01:33:52.337 --> 01:33:53.672
Bill Clay.

01:33:59.761 --> 01:34:01.889
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

01:34:03.265 --> 01:34:07.644
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
That game with the guns that shoot red paint.

01:34:07.728 --> 01:34:09.980
Probably seems stupid to you.

01:34:11.398 --> 01:34:12.608
Nope.

01:34:15.694 --> 01:34:18.530
Time for the real thing, Bill.

01:34:26.038 --> 01:34:28.916
All you got to do is pull the trigger.

01:34:28.999 --> 01:34:29.583
Come on.

01:34:37.925 --> 01:34:42.304
<i>33. Stockwerk. Kommt sofort.</i>

01:34:42.387 --> 01:34:44.389
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

01:34:49.019 --> 01:34:53.315
Put down the gun
and give me my detonators.

01:34:57.778 --> 01:34:59.780
Well, well, well.

01:35:01.156 --> 01:35:02.199
Hans.

01:35:03.242 --> 01:35:05.786
Put it down now.

01:35:09.373 --> 01:35:12.876
That's pretty tricky with that accent.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.171
You oughta be on fuckin' TV with that accent.

01:35:18.465 --> 01:35:22.094
But what do you want with the detonators?

01:35:22.177 --> 01:35:24.846
I already used all the explosives.

01:35:27.182 --> 01:35:29.893
Or did I?

01:35:29.977 --> 01:35:34.106
- I'm going to count to three.
- Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:35.148
<i>(click)</i>

01:35:35.232 --> 01:35:35.899

01:35:42.406 --> 01:35:43.323

01:38:09.928 --> 01:38:12.055
Tell me you got something.

01:38:12.139 --> 01:38:16.101
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

01:38:16.184 --> 01:38:18.687
and his family's home address...

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:20.188
right here in LA.

01:38:22.065 --> 01:38:22.816
Whoo!

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:25.694
<i>(elevator bell)</i>

01:38:28.363 --> 01:38:29.698

Got it.

01:38:43.712 --> 01:38:46.965
God, that man looks really pissed.

01:38:49.259 --> 01:38:51.553
He's still alive.

01:38:51.636 --> 01:38:53.930
What?

01:38:54.014 --> 01:38:57.851
Only John can drive somebody that crazy.

<i>(groans)</i>

01:39:13.825 --> 01:39:18.121
Hans, heat up that miracle because
we just broke through on number six,

01:39:18.205 --> 01:39:20.957
and the electromagnetic
came down like an anvil.

01:39:21.041 --> 01:39:26.379
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

01:39:28.798 --> 01:39:32.469
<i>(Powell) Hey, John.
John McClane, you still with us?</i>

01:39:32.552 --> 01:39:34.387
Yeah.

01:39:34.471 --> 01:39:38.808
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

01:39:38.892 --> 01:39:41.269
Chalk up two more bad guys.

<i>We got a pool going on you.</i>

01:39:46.983 --> 01:39:48.860
What kind of odds am I getting?

01:39:48.944 --> 01:39:50.612
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

01:39:50.695 --> 01:39:53.365
Put me down for 20. I'm good for it.

01:39:57.285 --> 01:39:59.955
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

01:40:02.457 --> 01:40:04.668
What the hell you talking about, man?

01:40:04.751 --> 01:40:07.170
Something had to get you off the street.

01:40:07.254 --> 01:40:11.800
<i>What's the matter? You don't think
a desk job is a noble effort for a cop?</i>

01:40:13.718 --> 01:40:15.387
<i>No.</i>

01:40:18.431 --> 01:40:20.475
I had an accident.

01:40:20.559 --> 01:40:23.645
<i>The way you drive, I can see why.
What'd you do?</i>

01:40:23.728 --> 01:40:26.314
Run over your captain's foot with the car?

01:40:30.193 --> 01:40:32.904
I shot a kid.

01:40:32.988 --> 01:40:35.991
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

01:40:36.074 --> 01:40:40.120
<i>It was dark. I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.</i>

01:40:43.373 --> 01:40:47.127
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

01:40:47.210 --> 01:40:49.129
except how to live with a mistake.

01:40:53.133 --> 01:40:57.929
<i>Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.</i>

01:41:00.974 --> 01:41:02.976
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:06.521
Hey, man, how could you know?

01:41:08.857 --> 01:41:10.692
I feel like shit anyway.

01:41:13.695 --> 01:41:20.076
Well, this won't matter. The LAPD is
not calling the shots down here any more.

01:41:22.537 --> 01:41:24.205
The Feds?

01:41:24.289 --> 01:41:25.373
You got it.

01:41:26.958 --> 01:41:29.252
Those are the city engineers.

01:41:30.462 --> 01:41:31.963
Wait.

01:41:32.047 --> 01:41:34.758
They're going into the street circuits.

01:41:34.841 --> 01:41:37.052
The guys in suits, I don't know who they are.

01:41:37.135 --> 01:41:38.887
<i>(Hans)</i> That's the FBI.

01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:42.557
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:44.601
Regular as clockwork.

01:41:46.478 --> 01:41:48.480
Or a time lock.

01:41:48.563 --> 01:41:50.315
<i>(Hans)</i> Precisely.

01:41:50.398 --> 01:41:54.194
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

in response to a terrorist incident.

01:41:57.113 --> 01:41:59.240
You asked for miracles, Theo.

01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:02.452
I give you the FBI.

01:42:03.578 --> 01:42:07.749
- I want the building shut down.
- I got a switch...

01:42:07.832 --> 01:42:12.712
I don't care about your switch.
I want it out. Dark! D-a-r-k.

01:42:12.796 --> 01:42:14.339
You can't do it from here.

01:42:14.422 --> 01:42:16.841
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

01:42:16.925 --> 01:42:18.635
I could... I got the radio...

01:42:18.718 --> 01:42:22.180
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

01:42:22.263 --> 01:42:26.142
They've gotta take out a whole city grid.
We're talking 10 blocks.

01:42:26.226 --> 01:42:30.063
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.
There's thousands of people...

<i>(big Johnson)</i> You have to go wider.

- How about the United States government?

01:42:37.737 --> 01:42:39.781
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

01:42:45.954 --> 01:42:47.789
- Yeah, Central?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:42:47.872 --> 01:42:50.208
This is Walt, down at Nakatomi.

Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

01:42:55.296 --> 01:42:56.423
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

01:42:56.506 --> 01:42:59.175
Maybe I should call the mayor.

01:42:59.259 --> 01:43:02.345
No shit it's my ass. I got a big problem here.

01:43:02.429 --> 01:43:04.806
Shut it down now.

<i>(Powell) Ask the FBI.</i>

01:43:15.483 --> 01:43:20.697
They got the universal terrorist playbook

Merry Christmas.

01:43:53.855 --> 01:43:58.985
- They must be pissing in their pants.
- The mayor is gonna have my ass.

01:44:05.992 --> 01:44:07.327
Whoo!

01:44:20.215 --> 01:44:22.467
What are we gonna do now?

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:27.472
- Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
- We've shut them down.

01:44:27.555 --> 01:44:31.017
We let them sweat for a while,
then give them helicopters.

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:33.311
Right up the ass.

01:44:35.897 --> 01:44:37.440
This is Agent Johnson.

01:44:37.524 --> 01:44:38.900
No, the other one.

01:44:38.983 --> 01:44:42.278
I want air support
ready to lift off in five minutes.

01:44:42.362 --> 01:44:45.824
Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.

01:44:51.746 --> 01:44:53.623
Oh, yes!

01:44:55.333 --> 01:44:57.752
I wish to talk to the FBI.

01:45:00.338 --> 01:45:02.465
This is Special Agent Johnson.

01:45:02.549 --> 01:45:07.011
<i>The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.</i>

01:45:07.095 --> 01:45:09.722

<i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>

01:45:12.141 --> 01:45:14.561
When he figures out what hit him,
he'll be in a body bag.

01:45:15.436 --> 01:45:18.314
When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.

01:45:18.398 --> 01:45:24.445
By the time they figure it all out,
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

01:45:29.534 --> 01:45:31.035
Ah! Jeez!

01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:32.912
Powell?

01:45:32.996 --> 01:45:34.831
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

01:45:36.583 --> 01:45:38.293
I'm here, John.

01:45:40.003 --> 01:45:43.548
Listen, I'm starting
to get a bad feeling up here.

01:45:43.631 --> 01:45:45.550
I want you to do something for me.

01:45:45.633 --> 01:45:46.926
Um...

01:45:48.469 --> 01:45:52.390
I want you to find my wife.
Don't ask me how. By then you'll know how.

01:45:52.473 --> 01:45:59.147
Uh, I want you to tell her something.
I want you to tell her that...

01:45:59.981 --> 01:46:01.649
um...

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:08.740
Tell her it took me a while to figure out

01:46:08.823 --> 01:46:10.909
what a jerk I've been,

01:46:11.492 --> 01:46:13.494
but, um...

01:46:14.412 --> 01:46:15.413
that...

01:46:19.292 --> 01:46:22.003
that when things started to pan out for her,

01:46:22.086 --> 01:46:26.466
I shoulda been more supportive.

01:46:26.549 --> 01:46:27.425
And, uh...

01:46:28.927 --> 01:46:32.096
I just should have been behind her more.

01:46:34.641 --> 01:46:36.643
Oh, shit.

01:46:38.561 --> 01:46:40.688
Tell her that, um...

01:46:41.564 --> 01:46:46.194
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

01:46:48.112 --> 01:46:51.741
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

01:46:52.742 --> 01:46:56.704
She never heard me say "I'm sorry."

01:46:56.788 --> 01:47:04.295
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

01:47:04.379 --> 01:47:06.297
OK?

01:47:06.381 --> 01:47:07.548
You got that, man?

01:47:07.632 --> 01:47:09.884
<i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>

01:47:11.219 --> 01:47:14.055
But you can tell her that yourself.

01:47:14.138 --> 01:47:18.226
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

01:47:18.309 --> 01:47:20.687

I am an exceptional thief, Mrs McClane.

Blow the roof!
