WEBVTT

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.916
Twice in a single generation,

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:45.295
the catastrophe of world war
has fallen upon us.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:50.092
Twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.135
reached out across the oceans

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.931
to bring the United States
into the forefront of the battle.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.810
Our American merchant ships must be free

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.313
to carry our American goods
into the harbors of our friends.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:10.279
And our American merchant ships
must be protected by our American Navy.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.450
The brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen,

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:18.787
and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:23.000
in a hard, unrelenting struggle,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.670
which goes on night and day

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.883
and is going on now
without a moment's respite.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.928
The goods will be
delivered by this nation,

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.682
whose navy believes in the tradition

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:42.686
of "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.943
"Dear Lord,
let your holy angel be with me,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:17.739
that the evil foe may have no power
over me. Amen."

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:50.647
Merry Christmas.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.711
Merry Christmas.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.296
Cigars?

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.386
"Yesterday, today and forever."

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.389
That's beautiful. I'll put it on my tree.

00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:28.602
All right. Your turn. Come on.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.895
All right.

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:38.195
Monogrammed.

00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:42.658
What's this?

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.370
Congratulations.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.872
Your first command. At last.

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:55.712
After all those years of being fitted
and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.256
You deserve it.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.509
I knew after Pearl Harbor
they would be needing men like you.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.137
I report to Norfolk
right after the first of the year.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.516
Norfolk? Not Treasure Island?

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.518
That's the navy in a nutshell, isn't it?

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.228
Yeah.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.357
Then the Caribbean
for training and tactics.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.944
Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba.
Rum and Coca-Cola.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.238
Then active duty.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:23.740
Come with me.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.994
I mean it.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.583
So I can ask you to marry me
on a tropical beach.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.547
I'd like that, but we can't.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.843
The world has gone crazy, Ernie.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.137
Let's wait until we can be together.

00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:05.532
I will always be looking for you, Evie.

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.160
No matter where I am.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.788
Even if I'm a thousand miles away,

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:15.042
I will be hoping I'll see you
come around the corner.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.547
Because when you do,
it's the greatest feeling in the world.

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.204
-Morning.
-Morning, Captain.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.873
Charlie, how are the overnights?

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:56.542
Convoy's three days into the Pit.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.253
No contacts, no incidents,
except on your ship, sir.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.881
Two bored sailors with time
on their hands, which became fists.

00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:04.967
-Who?
-Shannon and Flusser.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.386
-Crew's getting nervous, Ernie.
-Sleep well, sir?

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.180
I've never had the gift
for sleeping onboard.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.933
And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir.

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.232
-Amen.
-Amen.

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.609
Sea's a bit high to serve hot food.

00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.862
I could manage a ham steak
and eggs for you, sir.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.239
-This will do. Thank you, Cleveland.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.120
Report to the commanding officer.
Clear the room.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.211
Uncover.

00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.144
Explain yourselves.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.105
Flusser.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.024
I regret the incident, sir.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:04.818
Shannon.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:08.071
I too regret the incident.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.753
I will tolerate no more fisticuffs
on my ship.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.379
So...

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:28.217
"restore the relationships you have
damaged and fill me with peace."

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.097
Sir?

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.227
Captain requested, bridge, sir.
Captain requested, bridge.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:44.608
Repetition will bring hell
down from on high.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.111
Back to your duties.

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.447
Count your blessings.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.158
Captain on the bridge.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.661
Aye.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.037
Sir, good morning.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.374
Escorts Eagle and Harry are
out of position, six miles from convoy.

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.919
They've been off on their own, sir,
for roughly two hours.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.308
Eagle skipper announced,
"Starting the day with a good hunt," sir,

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:19.726
and then Harry joined in.

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:33.782
Message from the commodore, sir.

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.325
Read it out.

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.413
"Comconvoy to Comescort.
H-U-F-F D-U-F-F"--

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.749
"Huff Duff." High-frequency
direction finding. Continue, please.

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:47.254
"Huff Duff reports a German transmission
bearing 087 degrees.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.548
Range 15 to 20 miles."

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.425
Commodore says a likely U-boat, sir.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.183
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:00.893
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:02.477
Wait, wait. "Will run it down. Thank you."

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:03.896
"Will run it down. Thank you."
Aye, aye, sir.

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:06.523
-Mister Carling, I have the conn.
-Captain has the conn.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.650
All ahead full. Make turns for 36 knots.

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:11.403
All ahead full.
Make turns for 36 knots. Aye, sir.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.363
Right standard rudder, 079.

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.657
Right standard rudder to 079.
Aye, aye, sir.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.623
All escorts, Greyhound.
Return to your stations immediately.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:27.753
We have enemy contact bearing 087,
range 15 to 20 miles.

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.213
-Aye, sir.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.839
-Aye, Greyhound.
-Dicky, Greyhound.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.384
-Dicky, sir.
-Modify your station to assist the convoy

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:35.761
on the starboard side.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.347
Stragglers are mistiming
the course change.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.266
Keep your sonar on that starboard flank.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.602
Aye, sir. Sonar, starboard flank.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.895
Right full rudder, 087.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.105
Right full rudder to 087. Aye, aye, sir.

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:49.775
-Bring us up to general quarters.
-Boatswain, sound general quarters.

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:55.697
General quarters, general quarters...

00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:57.658
-Move. Let's go.
-...all hands, man your battle stations.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.868
We are running down
a possible U-boat contact.

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.668
Let's hammer those sons of bitches.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.295
Keep 'em coming, Cleveland.

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:16.426
Eagle, Greyhound. Take my position
at the front of the convoy.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.970
We're pursuing the target.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.888
Dicky, Greyhound. Cover the right flank.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.890
Front of convoy. Aye, aye, sir.

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:23.892
Aye, sir. Covering right flank.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.144
Eagle, Harry, Greyhound.

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:28.438
What is your ETA
for resuming new stations?

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:31.733
Greyhound, Eagle.
We can be at our station in 20 minutes.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.696
Harry, sir. We're now four miles
to port of the convoy.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.908
Yes, I know, Harry.
Return to your station at best speed.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.036
Sir, I've relieved Mister Carling.
Have the deck and the conn.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.790
Mister Watson, we have a target
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:48.917
-I have the conn.
-Aye, aye, sir. Captain has the conn.

00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:50.294
-Messenger.
-Sir.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.629
Go to my cabin and bring me
my sheepskin coat. You'll find it.

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:53.714
Aye, aye, sir.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.758
Combat, Conn. Charlie.

00:11:56.842 --> 00:12:01.638
We're running down a likely sub
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.308
I'm hoping it shows up
on your surface radar.

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:06.727
Conn, Combat. Aye, aye, sir.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.613
Now hear this, now hear this.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.158
This is the captain.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:22.910
We are running down the target.

00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:26.580
Let us attend our duties well.
This is what we've trained for.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.916
-Martin, what you got?
-Nothing yet, sir.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:40.844
Got him.

00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:47.267
Conn, Combat. Target bearing 092,
range 15 miles.

00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:49.144
Charlie, what do you make of this target?

00:12:49.228 --> 00:12:50.979
Most likely a U-boat, sir.

00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:54.525
Up for air and a battery charge.
Gettin' ready to come at us, Captain.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.988
Steady on 092, sir.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:01.698
Very well.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:11.708
Conn, Combat. Target bearing steady
at 094, range 12 miles.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:14.795
Weapons, pass the word,
do not open fire without orders from me.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.761
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:25.681
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:35.023
Stop that noise.

00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:38.527
Range 9.5 miles, bearing steady on 094.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.781
Close enough for the five-inch, sir.

00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:47.160
Heavy seas, Mister Watson,
with only a radar bearing.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.788
Let's have our eyes on him.

00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:50.873
Aye, aye, sir.

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:17.274
Target's disappeared, sir.
Fell off the radar about six miles out.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:19.902
What's this, Charlie?

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:21.695
Looks like he's dived, sir,
by the way the pips faded out.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.281
He must've seen us, sir.
Got his air and dove.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.742
Pips had him on course for us
and the convoy, sir.

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.368
Can you plot a search radius?

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:31.872
I could, sir, but in ten minutes,
the radius would be three square miles.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.126
Give me a course to intercept

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.921
if the target maintains this course
at six knots.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.047
Aye, aye, sir.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:00.526
Conn, Combat.
Course to intercept is 096.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.570
Warn me two miles out from this intercept.

00:15:03.654 --> 00:15:04.780
Aye, aye, sir.

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:06.615
Right handsomely, 096.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.909
Right handsomely to 096. Aye, aye, sir.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.428
Combat reports
two miles from intercept, sir.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.266
Mister Watson, we need to slow down
for sonar. Make turns for 22 knots.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.226
Make turns for 22 knots, aye, aye, sir.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:36.228
All ahead standard.
Make turns at 22 knots.

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:40.691

00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:13.432
Any screw noises?

00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:20.072

00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:47.057
No oil slick. No debris.

00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:49.560
Fuck, I thought we had him, sir.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.228
Sorry, my language, sir.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.230
Mister Watson,
steady on a reciprocal course.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.232
-Maintain our present heading.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:58.402
Sonar, when we come about,
standard sweeps on both our bows.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:01.113
-Sonar, Bridge. When we've come about...
-Escorts, Greyhound.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:04.449
We have engaged the enemy,
but no hits on my drop.

00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:09.037
Our last contact had him bearing 295,
directly for the convoy.

00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:10.497
Tighten up your screens.

00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:12.291
He will be within firing range
of the convoy in--

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.750

00:22:42.738 --> 00:22:45.365
Sonar reports crunch
of a sinking vessel, sir.

00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.334
We got him.

00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:01.256
Pipe it.

00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:09.014
Now hear this. Now hear this.

00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:13.810
This is the captain.
It seems we sank that target.

00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:15.103
This was an all-hands job.

00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:18.398
Well done.

00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:22.861
Secure from general quarters.
Take us to Condition 3

00:23:22.945 --> 00:23:24.863
and arrange for hot food
if at all possible.

00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:25.948
Aye, aye, sir.

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.116
Secure from general quarters.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.160
All hands, secure from general quarters.

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:34.414
Escorts, Greyhound.
We have sighted evidence of a kill.

00:23:34.498 --> 00:23:37.835
Congratulations, Captain.
More food for the fish.

00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:39.336
The prize is yours, sir,

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.672
but we'll need evidence of a kill
for the Admiralty.

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.258
Nothin' but the captain's trousers
will do, I'm afraid.

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:45.717
Just return to station.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.053
Congratulations, sir.

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:50.639
Shall I steer a course for the debris
to verify the kill?

00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:53.767
No, Mister Watson.

00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:55.894
Convoy is unguarded.
Take us back to station.

00:23:56.979 --> 00:23:59.648
Aye, aye, sir.
Helmsman, bring us back to station.

00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:01.024
Eppstine, is it?

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:02.860
Eppstein, sir.

00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:04.903
Good work. Thank you.

00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:06.572
It's why I'm aboard, sir.

00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:11.243
Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef
and onion, sliced thick for you.

00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:12.494
Gotta eat, sir.

00:24:12.578 --> 00:24:15.330
Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole.

00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:17.249
I bet he's worked up an appetite.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:20.377
Now, Mister Dawson.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.753
It's from the Admiralty, sir.

00:24:21.837 --> 00:24:24.506
They've intercepted
multiple German transmissions.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.924
It's at least two hours old.

00:24:27.593 --> 00:24:30.262
"Enemy activity expected
at Position Oboe."

00:24:45.777 --> 00:24:47.738
Congratulations, Captain.

00:24:48.822 --> 00:24:50.115
It's our first U-boat.

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:53.952
Congratulations, sir. Fifty less krauts.

00:24:54.453 --> 00:24:56.747
Yes. Fifty souls.

00:24:59.124 --> 00:25:02.169
Sir, permission to secure
boilers two and four?

00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:04.338
Mister Nystrom,
are you not the officer of the deck?

00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:05.714
Yes, sir, I am, sir.

00:25:05.797 --> 00:25:08.050
Then take that to the chief engineer
without bothering me.

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:11.470
Aye, sir. Our noon position report, sir.

00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:14.306
I'm estimating we are at Position Oboe

00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:16.350
in the North Atlantic,
surrounded by open sea.

00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:18.143
-That about right?
-If you say so, sir.

00:25:18.227 --> 00:25:20.729
Take us back to station
ahead of the convoy, center column.

00:25:20.812 --> 00:25:22.648
Ahead of convoy, center column. Aye, sir.

00:25:24.483 --> 00:25:27.819
Left standard rudder. Steer course 190.

00:25:27.903 --> 00:25:31.156
Left standard rudder,
steering course 190. Aye, sir.

00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:47.381
...rudder. Steer course 270. Aye, sir.

00:25:47.464 --> 00:25:48.507
Sir.

00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:51.927
Your helmet, sir.
Shall I see it stowed away?

00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:55.222
Yes, thank you.

00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:00.394
Sir,

00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:03.730
noon fuel reports will be slightly off
due to that U-boat chase.

00:26:03.814 --> 00:26:05.190
Still waiting on reports from Dodge,

00:26:05.274 --> 00:26:08.026
but Viktor and James are reporting
diminishing reserves.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.444
Send a reply.

00:26:11.071 --> 00:26:15.367
"Comescort to James. Please use
utmost efforts to conserve fuel."

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.493
Aye, sir.

00:26:17.744 --> 00:26:19.788
Sir, after that last pattern,
now might be a good time

00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:22.291
to bring up the extra supply of depth
charges stowed in the crew quarters.

00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:24.376
-Permission granted. Thank you.
-Aye, sir.

00:26:34.678 --> 00:26:35.888
Two distress rockets...

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:38.724
Forward Lookout reports
two distress rockets rear of the convoy.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.101
Reciprocal course.

00:26:41.185 --> 00:26:43.729
-Mister Nystrom, I have the conn.
-Captain has the conn.

00:26:52.112 --> 00:26:53.113
Where?

00:26:53.197 --> 00:26:55.324
There, sir. That's the Despotiko, sir.

00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:57.492
She's a merchant ship.
Last ship in the line.

00:27:02.164 --> 00:27:04.625
Signals report commodore
signaling general alarm, sir.

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.960
Mister Nystrom, come left at 200.

00:27:07.044 --> 00:27:08.962
Alert all escorts,
"I'm going to the rear."

00:27:09.046 --> 00:27:12.591
Send in Cadena for rescue
and bring us up to general quarters.

00:27:13.175 --> 00:27:16.678
General quarters. General quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

00:27:17.596 --> 00:27:20.015
All ahead standard. Sonar, resume sweeps.

00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.684
Sonar, Bridge. Resume sweeps.

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:51.672
Torpedo! Torpedo! Bearing 205, range 500.

00:27:51.755 --> 00:27:53.924
-Where?
-There, sir.

00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:00.055
-Right full rudder.
-Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

00:28:04.643 --> 00:28:06.186
Shoot me a bearing
of where that came from.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.437
Yes, sir.

00:28:15.904 --> 00:28:17.614
Bearing 160.

00:28:17.698 --> 00:28:20.492
Charlie,
I'm steering to avoid a single torpedo.

00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:22.369
Point of origin, 160.

00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.914
Mister Nystrom, bring us around to port
in a reciprocal course

00:28:25.998 --> 00:28:27.124
into screening position.

00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:29.209
Put us between Cadena and that U-boat.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.713
-Screen Cadena. Aye. Left full rudder.
-Left full rudder. Aye, sir.

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:34.089
All ahead flank.

00:28:35.007 --> 00:28:38.510
Message from Cadena, sir.
She signals rescue completed.

00:28:38.594 --> 00:28:39.595
Thank you.

00:28:40.637 --> 00:28:41.805
-Messenger.
-Captain.

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:43.807
Write this. "Comescort to Cadena.

00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:46.977
Rejoin convoy at best speed.
Modified zigzag."

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.478
-Send it.
-Aye, sir.

00:28:57.487 --> 00:28:59.823
Distant noises.
Port quarter, bearing indefinite.

00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:02.784
Sonar reports distant noises.
Port quarter, bearing indefinite.

00:29:02.868 --> 00:29:04.953
Assumes it's hull of ship
breaking up, sir.

00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:07.414
-Sonar, sweep to starboard.
-Sonar, Bridge. Sweep to starboard.

00:29:07.497 --> 00:29:10.083
Mister Nystrom, ease the rudder. Meet her.

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:11.793
Maintain this screening position.

00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:13.462
Holding this course. Aye, aye, sir.

00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:19.384
Zigzag right. Ten degrees rudder.

00:29:19.468 --> 00:29:21.595
Right ten degrees rudder. Aye, sir.

00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:27.184
Steady at ten degrees, sir.

00:29:28.268 --> 00:29:30.229
-Steady as you go.
-Steady as I go.

00:29:30.312 --> 00:29:32.022
Return message from Cadena, sir.

00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.610
She's two hours from convoy, sir.
Reports 42 men rescued from Despotiko.

00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:39.530
Very well. Thank you.

00:29:40.113 --> 00:29:41.573
Skipper, we're freezing up.

00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:44.326
I've given orders for the steam hoses
to keep the depth charges clear.

00:29:44.409 --> 00:29:46.954
Greyhound, Harry. Greyhound, Harry.

00:29:47.663 --> 00:29:48.705
Greyhound.

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:51.250
Pips on the radar screen,
bearing 091, sir.

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:53.627
Looks like two subs
directly ahead of the convoy.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.921
-Range 10 miles.
-Harry has two contacts, 10 miles.

00:29:56.004 --> 00:29:57.381

-Go ahead, Dicky.

00:29:57.464 --> 00:30:00.634
We got a pip, bearing 098, range 14 miles.

00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:03.387
Greyhound, Eagle.
We've got Harry's pip, sir, and another.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.640
Bearing 090, range 13 miles.

00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:09.351
Very well. Four contacts now.

00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:11.186
Zigzag 20 degrees. Left standard rudder.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.146
Twenty degrees.
Left standard rudder. Aye, sir.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.773
Eagle here, with another pip on the move.

00:30:14.857 --> 00:30:16.567
-Range five miles, bearing 07...
-Another. Five miles,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.901
dead ahead of the convoy.

00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:20.946
Greyhound, Harry.
Nine miles to one pip at 090.

00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:23.240
The other bearing 092, range eight miles.

00:30:23.323 --> 00:30:24.658
Are the ranges closing?

00:30:24.741 --> 00:30:27.327
Negative, Greyhound.
They seem to be behaving at present.

00:30:27.411 --> 00:30:29.371
Very well. Maintain your stations.

00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:31.248
Attack within range and good luck.

00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:37.421
A wolf pack shadowing us.
They'll attack as a group.

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:41.925
Yeah, waiting for nightfall,
when we can't see nothing.

00:30:44.178 --> 00:30:45.345
I need you down below.

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:47.681
Keep an eye on the surface radar
for our friend back here.

00:30:47.764 --> 00:30:48.849
Aye, aye, sir.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.208
Six subs, guys.
We got a contact report from Eagle?

00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:16.418
Aye, sir, got 'em all.
They're keeping their distance.

00:31:16.502 --> 00:31:19.254
Five ahead of the convoy
and our little dance partner back here,

00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:22.549
tracking us and the Cadena.
Presumed bearing 196.

00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:53.580
-Signal from the commodore, sir.
-Read it out.

00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:55.749
"Comconvoy to Comescort.

00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:59.461
Numerous German language transmissions
10 to 15 miles ahead. Various bearings."

00:32:00.212 --> 00:32:01.213
Very well.

00:32:01.296 --> 00:32:04.174
I need the gloves you'll find
in my cabin. The fur, not the knit.

00:32:04.258 --> 00:32:05.801
Gloves. Fur, not knit. Aye, aye, sir.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.691
Chief Rudel,
I need these wipers operating.

00:32:20.774 --> 00:32:23.026
It's not electrical, sir. They're frozen.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.487
I can put some men on it
with buckets and swabs.

00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:27.781
Salt water. Warm salt water, not boiling.

00:32:27.865 --> 00:32:29.074
Aye, sir.

00:32:30.993 --> 00:32:33.537
Conn, Combat. Looks like our friend's
come up for fresh air

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.247
and to maintain speed with us, sir.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.501
Contact bearing 207, range three miles.

00:32:39.585 --> 00:32:41.503

00:32:41.587 --> 00:32:43.755
Hard right rudder to 207. Aye, sir.

00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:55.475
Target now bears 208.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.396
Target now bears 208. Range...

00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:01.940
Range looks like 2.5 miles.

00:33:02.024 --> 00:33:03.650
Looks like 2.5 miles.

00:33:03.734 --> 00:33:05.027
-What's goin' on?
-I don't know, sir.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.278
I can't get a good read.

00:33:09.031 --> 00:33:10.741
Come right to 220.

00:33:10.824 --> 00:33:12.826
Come right to 220. Aye, sir.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:16.079
What do you mean, "looks like"?
I need a bearing on this target, Charlie.

00:33:16.163 --> 00:33:17.706
It's my radar, sir. It's gone soft.

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:20.083
-I need Rudel down here.
-Understood.

00:33:20.626 --> 00:33:23.045
Have Chief Rudel report to the XO
in the CIC.

00:33:23.128 --> 00:33:24.880
Mister Lopez, all mounts, local control.

00:33:24.963 --> 00:33:26.507
-Fire when they bear.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.760
All mounts, local control.
Fire as you bear.

00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:34.473
Bearing's changing, 203. Range--

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:37.434
Contact bearing's changing, 203.

00:33:37.518 --> 00:33:41.480
-Range looks like 2.5 miles.
-203, range 2.5 miles.

00:33:41.563 --> 00:33:43.190
Firing on target, starboard bow.

00:33:43.273 --> 00:33:44.733
Left standard rudder to 180.

00:33:44.816 --> 00:33:46.944
Left standard rudder to 180. Aye, sir.

00:33:47.027 --> 00:33:48.654
U-boat, starboard bow!

00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:02.835
Fire Control reports
five-inch mounts opened fire on target.

00:34:02.918 --> 00:34:04.920
Eleven rounds fired.
No hits observed, sir.

00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:06.880
Left standard rudder to 100.

00:34:06.964 --> 00:34:10.175
-Left standard rudder to 100.
-Messenger, take this to Signals.

00:34:10.259 --> 00:34:11.552
"Greyhound to Cadena.

00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:15.138
Must return to station at head of convoy
to engage targets.

00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:17.056
Fired on U-boat. Drove him under.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:20.268
Have faith you will outrun him.
Good luck."

00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:21.395
Send that.

00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:23.063
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:24.898
What can we do
about this damn interference?

00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:27.109
It's not interference, sir.
I checked everything.

00:34:27.192 --> 00:34:28.735
The pilot light's on, no surge currents,

00:34:28.819 --> 00:34:30.654
and I reset the overload relay
four days ago.

00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:35.449
I could reset it again, but we're gonna be
down nearly two hours. Waste of time, sir.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.541
Bridge.

00:34:42.623 --> 00:34:45.252
"The night cometh
when no man can work," Ernie.

00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:47.129
Rudel's done all he can.

00:34:47.212 --> 00:34:50.340
We're just gonna have to live with
the radar how it is for now, Captain.

00:34:50.924 --> 00:34:52.509
Understood. Thank you, Charlie.

00:35:37.638 --> 00:35:41.225
Captain, need to slow in the sea,
or we risk blowing a turbine.

00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:42.684
Understood.

00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:44.937
Mister Harbutt, she can't take it.
Slow us down a bit.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.564
-All ahead two-thirds.
-All ahead two-thirds. Aye, aye, sir.

00:35:47.648 --> 00:35:49.858
-Darken the ship.
-Shift to red.

00:35:50.817 --> 00:35:52.194
You missed another meal, sir.

00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:54.905
Brought you a bacon and egg sandwich,
still warm.

00:35:54.988 --> 00:35:56.740
I found some of those peaches you like.

00:36:04.706 --> 00:36:05.707
Amen.

00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:06.792
Amen.

00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:08.335
I'll keep the coffee coming, sir.

00:36:08.794 --> 00:36:10.754
-Coffee, Mister Harbutt?
-Thank you, sir.

00:36:14.758 --> 00:36:16.134
Distress rocket, sir.

00:36:16.218 --> 00:36:19.388
Lookouts report gunfire, bearing 046,
range three miles.

00:36:21.348 --> 00:36:23.392
-I'll take it, Mister Harbutt.
-Captain has the conn.

00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:26.061
-Bring us up to general quarters.
-Boatswain Mate, Condition 1.

00:36:26.144 --> 00:36:28.564
Left full rudder. Steer us across
the front of the convoy.

00:36:28.647 --> 00:36:30.440
General quarters, general quarters.

00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:32.150
All hands, man your battle stations.

00:36:32.234 --> 00:36:35.445
Set Condition 1 throughout the ship.
Lock down all watertight passageways.

00:36:35.529 --> 00:36:38.991
Combat reports sub bearing 036.
One and a half miles, sir.

00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:41.577
All mounts, fire at will.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.953
All mounts, fire at will.

00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:49.835
Merchant ship dead ahead!

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.965
Check fire!

00:36:55.048 --> 00:36:57.968
-Hard left rudder, hard over!
-Check fire! Cease fire!

00:37:18.238 --> 00:37:19.823
Right standard rudder!

00:37:19.907 --> 00:37:21.909
Right standard rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

00:37:32.878 --> 00:37:34.796
All ahead standard!

00:37:37.883 --> 00:37:39.718
Son? You heard the order?

00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:42.054
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

00:37:42.137 --> 00:37:43.514
All ahead standard!

00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:48.977
U-boat!

00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:50.145
Where?

00:37:50.229 --> 00:37:54.358
U-boat bearing 012, range 1,000!
Between us and the freighters!

00:38:02.658 --> 00:38:04.743
Check! Check! Check!

00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:07.162
Mister Lopez,
you have freighters in the line of fire!

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:09.831
-Cease fire, cease fire.
-All batteries, check fire!

00:38:09.915 --> 00:38:11.834
Cease fire! Cease fire!

00:38:16.463 --> 00:38:19.383
Friendly fire, friendly fire!
They can't see us!

00:38:30.227 --> 00:38:31.562
Close up, close up!

00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:34.064
Man that telegraph!
Get replacements up here!

00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:41.113
-Right full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
-Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

00:38:41.196 --> 00:38:43.407
Mister Lopez,
prepare to engage that target.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.118
When he dives, we're gonna hammer him
with two patterns: shallow, then deep.

00:38:46.201 --> 00:38:47.119
Aye, sir!

00:38:47.202 --> 00:38:51.248
That's the Vasco, sir!
She's an oil tanker. She could blow!

00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:54.751
Mind your helm across the column!

00:38:54.835 --> 00:38:56.128
Minding my helm. Aye, aye, sir.

00:38:56.211 --> 00:38:58.463
-Slow to one-third.
-Slow to one-third. Aye, sir.

00:38:58.547 --> 00:39:00.716
-Watch that merchantman.
-Aye, sir.

00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:06.096
He's diving! U-boat diving, bearing 040.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.389
Range close aboard!

00:39:08.223 --> 00:39:09.516
-Mister Lopez.
-Aye, sir.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.893
Stand by for shallow pattern.

00:39:10.976 --> 00:39:12.728
Stand by for shallow pattern.
Aye, aye, sir!

00:39:12.811 --> 00:39:14.646
Sonar, sweep for contact
to starboard beam.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.940
Sonar, Bridge.
Sweep for contact to starboard beam.

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:21.403
Bridge, Sonar. There's too many screws.
I can't hear anything.

00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:23.614
Sonar reports mixed signals, sir.
Too many propellers.

00:39:23.697 --> 00:39:25.449
-On my command, Mister Lopez.
-Aye, sir.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.953
Still too many screws.
Interference from the convoy.

00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:32.497
Sonar reports too many screws, sir.
Interference from the convoy.

00:39:47.304 --> 00:39:48.555
I got something.

00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:58.273
Got 'em. Contact close.
Starboard beam 083.

00:39:58.357 --> 00:40:00.484
Sonar reports contact close.
Starboard beam 083, sir.

00:40:00.567 --> 00:40:02.194
Correction, starboard beam 088, sir.

00:40:02.277 --> 00:40:03.320
Now, Mister Lopez!

00:40:03.403 --> 00:40:05.989
Fire, fire! Roll two, fire.
Port to starboard.

00:40:13.038 --> 00:40:14.623
Next pattern, Mister Lopez.

00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:15.749
Again, sir?

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:17.292
Yes, again, Mister Lopez!

00:40:17.376 --> 00:40:20.838
All positions, fire when ready.
All positions, fire, fire!

00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:22.464
Helm, meet her! Head up the lane!

00:40:22.548 --> 00:40:25.175
Meet her.
Heading up the lane. Aye, aye, sir.

00:40:34.893 --> 00:40:35.894
Come on.

00:40:37.062 --> 00:40:39.314
-Sonar reports contact bearing--
-Correction.

00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:41.650
-Correction. Sonar reports...
-Questionable screw noises.

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:43.318
...questionable screw noises.

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:45.112
Contact stationary.

00:40:45.195 --> 00:40:46.822
Sonar reports contact stationary.

00:40:46.905 --> 00:40:47.990
Stationary?

00:40:48.657 --> 00:40:50.158
Sonar, Bridge. Anything further?

00:40:56.748 --> 00:40:58.584
Still stationary. Possible decoy.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:02.921
Sonar reports contact is not moving.
Possible decoy.

00:41:17.186 --> 00:41:18.353
The tanker, sir!

00:41:30.073 --> 00:41:33.869
Survivors! Men in the water!
Port bow! Port bow!

00:41:33.952 --> 00:41:36.622
Contact. Bearing starboard 538, 538.

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.956
Distance 200 yards.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.459
-Mister Harbutt, who's your junior?
-Wallace, sir.

00:41:40.542 --> 00:41:41.835
Get him out here.

00:41:45.172 --> 00:41:47.508
Sir, a message from Cadena.

00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:48.592
Read it out.

00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:50.594
"Merchant ships vulnerable
at rear of convoy.

00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:52.888
Attack imminent.
Request your earliest assistance."

00:41:55.182 --> 00:41:58.769
Captain, survivors 500 yards starboard,
sir. Proceed with rescue?

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.737
Get down to midships,
put down a scrambling net

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.448
-and get those men out of the water.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:42:11.532 --> 00:42:13.659
Stop engines. All slow astern.

00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:15.911
Mister Harbutt, you have the conn.

00:42:15.994 --> 00:42:18.705
Mind the debris and hail me
the moment Wallace has them aboard.

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:20.123
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Signals?

00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:22.084
-Aye, sir.
-"Comescort to Cadena.

00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.673
Will assist as soon as possible."

00:42:28.215 --> 00:42:29.466
Aye, sir.

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:40.561
Give me your hand. Keep climbing.

00:42:41.103 --> 00:42:46.191
Krauts call it a Pillenwerfer, sir.
It's German for something.

00:42:46.275 --> 00:42:47.568
"Pill-thrower."

00:42:47.651 --> 00:42:49.736
-Yes, go on.
-I'd never heard of one before,

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.032
but I got a buddy who was on the Kidd,
and he had one on his first crossing.

00:42:54.116 --> 00:42:57.077
It's a mechanical decoy
about the size of an icebox,

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.204
and it shoots out gas
like an Alka-Seltzer.

00:42:59.288 --> 00:43:00.914
The krauts just drop it in the water,

00:43:00.998 --> 00:43:03.333
and it hangs there
while we waste depth charges on it.

00:43:04.001 --> 00:43:05.669
Detail it in your after-action report.

00:43:05.752 --> 00:43:08.130
Make sure all the other operators
are familiar with it.

00:43:08.213 --> 00:43:10.090
I should've caught it sooner, sir.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.260
No, you did good work. Thank you.

00:43:13.343 --> 00:43:14.553
Sir. Aye, sir.

00:43:14.636 --> 00:43:16.471
You couldn't have known, Ernie.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.019
Got 'em, sir. Four men.

00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:23.896
-Only four?
-All they could see or hear, sir.

00:43:23.979 --> 00:43:26.648
Okay. Head to rear of convoy.
Right hard rudder, hard over.

00:43:26.732 --> 00:43:27.774
All ahead two-thirds.

00:43:27.858 --> 00:43:30.068
Right hard rudder, hard over.
Aye, aye, sir.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.115
Rocket! Distress rocket astern!
Rear of convoy!

00:43:37.743 --> 00:43:40.204
All ahead flank. Meet her
when we're headed down the lane.

00:43:40.287 --> 00:43:42.080
All ahead flank. Aye, aye, sir.

00:43:51.423 --> 00:43:54.343
That's the Southland, sir.
It's an American supply ship.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.450
Greyhound, Harry here.

00:44:18.534 --> 00:44:23.080
To confirm, targets remain at speed
just outside our perimeter.

00:44:23.747 --> 00:44:26.250
Southland rescue completed.
Twenty-eight men rescued, sir.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.627
Radar is back up, Captain.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.379
Left full rudder to 087.

00:44:30.462 --> 00:44:32.840
Take us up the right side of the convoy.
All ahead standard.

00:44:32.923 --> 00:44:34.633
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:36.677
Engine room answers
all ahead standard, sir.

00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:43.892
Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:45.561
This is Gray Wolf.

00:44:46.478 --> 00:44:52.359
We hunt you and your friends
Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:56.905
We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

00:44:57.656 --> 00:45:02.119
We hear the screams of your comrades
as they die.

00:45:03.412 --> 00:45:07.583
How many of them will there be
before you join them?

00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:13.755
The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

00:45:15.299 --> 00:45:17.843
-Your women will learn of your dying...
-Greyhound to all escorts.

00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:21.138
-...and weep into the long night before...
-Switch TBS traffic to channel Zebra.

00:45:21.221 --> 00:45:24.391
-...they turn to the arms of their lovers.
-Execute.

00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:45.954
Eagle here. Pips on the move.

00:45:46.038 --> 00:45:48.874
One bearing 080,
range 11 miles and closing.

00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:51.168
The other at 085, nine miles.

00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:52.377
...that signal.

00:45:52.461 --> 00:45:54.004
Greyhound, Dicky. Greyhound, Dicky.

00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:56.381
-Greyhound.
-Our contact is now bearing 113.

00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:59.134
The other bears 101,
range two miles and approaching.

00:45:59.218 --> 00:46:01.178
Greyhound, Harry.
Our two pips are separated.

00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:04.223
Bearing 084 and 095. Both 8.5 miles.

00:46:04.306 --> 00:46:06.099
Looks as if they're coming in for a scrum.

00:46:06.183 --> 00:46:08.393
Noted, thank you. Greyhound out.

00:46:08.977 --> 00:46:10.979
Charlie, did you get the sighting reports?

00:46:11.063 --> 00:46:12.981
-Yes, sir.
-Here they come.

00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:28.497
Greyhound, Dicky. They're attacking!
Bearing 276, range 1,500.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.791
Target bearing 090,
coming across your bow.

00:46:30.874 --> 00:46:33.752
Dicky, Greyhound.
I see tracer fire over on your side.

00:46:33.836 --> 00:46:35.504
Are you engaging the target?

00:47:25.554 --> 00:47:28.015
Status report. No contacts at present.

00:47:28.098 --> 00:47:30.767
Known losses during the night, five ships,

00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:35.105
Vasco, Southland, Corning,
Paumbarten, Powell.

00:47:35.189 --> 00:47:39.651
Two ships damaged,
23 survivors, 210 confirmed dead.

00:48:02.758 --> 00:48:05.844
Greyhound, Eagle.
Target sighted. Engaging now.

00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:10.015
Eagle, Greyhound.
We will join you to assist.

00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:15.771
-Mister Lopez.
-Aye, sir.

00:48:15.854 --> 00:48:18.649
-Our next pattern will be medium.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:48:18.732 --> 00:48:20.776
Lieutenant Fippler,
you better get up here.

00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:22.486
Right standard rudder to 210.

00:48:22.569 --> 00:48:25.280
Right standard rudder to 210.
Aye, aye, sir.

00:48:25.906 --> 00:48:27.115
-Mister Harbutt.
-Sir.

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:30.369
Keep apprised of Eagle's target bearing
and notify me when we're two miles out.

00:48:30.452 --> 00:48:31.453
Aye, aye, sir.

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:39.253
Sir, it's about the consumption
of depth charges.

00:48:39.336 --> 00:48:42.130
-Yes?
-Last pattern makes 32 cans fired.

00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:46.802
How many full patterns do we have left?

00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:48.011
None, sir.

00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:50.514
We're down to six charges.

00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:56.687
We pulled everything from below
last watch, if you recall, sir.

00:48:59.064 --> 00:49:01.650
Yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mister Flipper.

00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.652
It's Fippler, sir.

00:49:05.445 --> 00:49:09.157
Mister Fippler, we must leave off
the firing of full patterns.

00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:10.993
What I was gonna suggest, sir.

00:49:19.084 --> 00:49:23.172
"Wise as a serpent, harmless as a dove."

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:31.305
-Captain.
-I know it's risky, Charlie, but

00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:32.723
we need to break protocol.

00:49:32.806 --> 00:49:36.518
How soon can we reach air cover?
No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers.

00:49:36.602 --> 00:49:37.603
Aye, aye, sir.

00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:53.368
Go, Charlie.

00:49:53.452 --> 00:49:55.704
We can be in range
of air cover in 24 hours.

00:49:55.787 --> 00:49:58.165
That's 0800
if we shift to a direct course, sir.

00:49:58.248 --> 00:49:59.082
Thanks, Charlie.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.133
What happened to him?

00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:11.011
Took a header.
Gave me something more to do.

00:50:13.847 --> 00:50:15.933
-That for the captain?
-Yeah.

00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:19.019
Man hasn't had a bite to eat
or been off his feet since we left.

00:50:20.145 --> 00:50:23.232
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

00:50:23.982 --> 00:50:25.984
We're turning
to intercept at 16 knots, sir.

00:50:26.068 --> 00:50:28.070
-We'll do our best to hammer him.
-Understood, Dicky.

00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:29.446
Keep him under by all means.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:30.948
-Keep him under.
-Aye, sir.

00:50:32.533 --> 00:50:37.412
Combat, Conn. Keep a sharp eye out
for surface radar bearing 170.

00:50:37.496 --> 00:50:38.705
Sir, I have the deck and the conn.

00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:41.083
-Very well.
-Mister Watson has the deck and the conn.

00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:42.543
Distant contact, bearing 160.

00:50:42.626 --> 00:50:45.462
Sonar reports distant contact,
bearing 160.

00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:48.632
Dicky, Greyhound.
The contact is now ten degrees to my port.

00:50:48.715 --> 00:50:50.133
-Aye, sir.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:50:50.217 --> 00:50:52.094
-Mister Lopez.
-Single charges, sir?

00:50:52.177 --> 00:50:53.387
Single charges, yes.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:55.389
Sonar reports contact, bearing 160.

00:50:55.472 --> 00:50:57.057
Periscope, starboard bow!

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.642
All mounts, fire at will.

00:51:03.105 --> 00:51:05.232
-I've got it, Mister Watson.
-Captain has the conn.

00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:06.900
Right sharply, another ten degrees.

00:51:06.984 --> 00:51:08.944
Right sharp, ten degrees. Aye, sir.

00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:11.488
Contact bearing 156...

00:51:11.572 --> 00:51:15.617
Sonar reports contact, bearing 156,
range steady at 1,080 yards.

00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:18.370
Greyhound, Dicky.
I have him dead to rights. I'm attacking.

00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:21.081
-Range 1,000.
-Left full rudder to 085.

00:51:22.165 --> 00:51:25.127
Come on in, Dicky.
I'm turning to port to clear for you.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.045
Thank you, Greyhound. Here we come.

00:51:27.129 --> 00:51:29.548
-Left full rudder to 170.
-Left full rudder to 170.

00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:31.925
-All ahead flank.
-All ahead flank. Aye, sir.

00:51:33.844 --> 00:51:35.095
Torpedo!

00:51:36.305 --> 00:51:38.390
Your training, son. Bearing. Range.

00:51:38.473 --> 00:51:40.934
Torpedo in the water.
Starboard beam. 400 yards, sir.

00:51:41.018 --> 00:51:45.772
Torpedoes! Bearing 210!
Range 300! There, sir! Two fish!

00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:57.367
Hard right rudder! Hard over!

00:52:00.329 --> 00:52:02.956
Greyhound, Dicky.
I'm launching depth charges now.

00:52:07.169 --> 00:52:10.214
Understood, Dicky.
I am crossing your bow for my own attack.

00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:15.219
Underwater explosion.
Indications confused.

00:52:15.302 --> 00:52:18.305
Sonar reports only hearing explosions.
Indications confused.

00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:19.848
Right standard rudder to 110.

00:52:19.932 --> 00:52:22.100
Right standard rudder,
steer course 110. Aye, sir.

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.104
There he is. Bearing 001.
Range 400 yards.

00:52:26.188 --> 00:52:29.608
Sonar reports contact, bearing 001.
Range 400 yards.

00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:31.235
Right full rudder to 065.

00:52:31.318 --> 00:52:32.986
Right full rudder to 065. Aye, sir.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:34.696
Contact inside minimum sonar range.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.949
Contact inside minimum sonar range, sir.

00:52:39.743 --> 00:52:42.371
U-boat! Starboard stern!
Dicky forced him up!

00:52:49.294 --> 00:52:51.421
Looks damaged, sir. Can't submerge.

00:52:53.048 --> 00:52:54.883
Hard right rudder! Hard over!

00:52:56.468 --> 00:52:59.054
He's coming in close!
U-boat, starboard bow!

00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:10.148
He's slipped in under our guns, sir.
We can't hit him!

00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:26.582
Dicky's coming back in.
Portside ahead, sir.

00:53:29.793 --> 00:53:31.420
Greyhound, Dicky. I'm on him, sir.

00:53:32.796 --> 00:53:34.256
Give him hell, Dicky!

00:53:39.178 --> 00:53:42.014
Left full rudder!
Loop around and help Dicky.

00:53:49.938 --> 00:53:52.816
Dicky here. He's pulling in too close!
He's alongside of us.

00:54:02.409 --> 00:54:03.452
Take cover!

00:54:04.494 --> 00:54:05.495
On your feet.

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:07.039
Son of a bitch ricocheted off the surface.

00:54:07.122 --> 00:54:08.415
Man your posts.

00:54:08.498 --> 00:54:10.417
-Slow to one-third.
-My language, sir.

00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:12.544
Slow to one-third. Aye, sir.

00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:21.720
-Dicky's in the line of fire!
-Veer off, Dicky, veer off.

00:54:23.555 --> 00:54:24.765
Hold your fire.

00:54:24.848 --> 00:54:26.308
-Left full rudder.
-Left full rudder.

00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:28.810
All mounts, local control,
stand by broadside to port.

00:54:28.894 --> 00:54:30.854
-Fire as they bear.
-Aye, sir.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:37.945
Come on, clear.

00:54:39.071 --> 00:54:40.906
Get clear, Dicky. Clear!

00:54:52.209 --> 00:54:54.002
Corpsman! Corpsman!

00:54:54.711 --> 00:54:57.214
-Dicky's clear!
-All mounts, commence fire!

00:55:17.442 --> 00:55:18.610
Get some water in there!

00:55:24.992 --> 00:55:26.994
Dicky, Greyhound. What is your damage?

00:55:27.077 --> 00:55:29.997
Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress
far enough to do any damage.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.125
But, at 20 yards, the shells
went right through us without detonating.

00:55:33.208 --> 00:55:34.209
Are you seaworthy?

00:55:34.293 --> 00:55:36.086
All three hits
were well above the waterline, sir.

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:38.380
We'll have our holes patched,
and we'll be back in the hunt.

00:55:38.463 --> 00:55:41.592
Very good. Return to your
screening station at best speed.

00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.638
Direct hit on mount 43, sir.

00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:49.516
Damage Control reports fire,
abaft frame 24.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.020
There's no flooding below the waterline,
and the casualty count is coming, sir.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.282
Three severely wounded.

00:56:05.365 --> 00:56:08.577
Bonnor. Meyer.
Forbrick is in critical shape. Three dead.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.870
Who are the dead?

00:56:09.953 --> 00:56:13.290
Pisani, gunner's mate, third class.
Marx, seaman, second.

00:56:14.166 --> 00:56:15.501
Cleveland, messmate.

00:56:18.128 --> 00:56:22.424
Took a hit at the portside 40-millimeter
gun tub, loading ammunition, sir.

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.302
I've got no room for corpses
down below, sir.

00:56:25.385 --> 00:56:26.720
Not with the four we pulled from Vasco.

00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.556
I can arrange for a service
within the next ten minutes, sir.

00:56:31.058 --> 00:56:32.559
Of course. All hands.

00:56:32.643 --> 00:56:33.769
Aye, aye, Captain.

00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:36.313
Bill?

00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:38.607
How bad was he hit?

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.650
Sir?

00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:41.985
George Cleveland.

00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:45.030
Completely mutilated, sir. All of them.

00:56:54.414 --> 00:56:57.251
"We therefore commit
the earthly remains of Anthony Pisani,

00:56:57.334 --> 00:56:59.628
Daniel Marx,
and George Cleveland to the deep,

00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:02.923
looking for the general Resurrection
in their last day

00:57:03.006 --> 00:57:05.926
and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.388
at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world

00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:11.348
the sea shall give up her dead,

00:57:11.431 --> 00:57:14.101
and corruptible bodies of those
who sleep in him

00:57:14.184 --> 00:57:17.354
shall be changed
and made like unto his glorious body

00:57:17.437 --> 00:57:19.398
according to the mighty working

00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:23.485
whereby he is able to subdue
all things unto himself. Amen."

00:57:27.614 --> 00:57:28.657
All stop.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.200
XO commands all stop.

00:57:30.284 --> 00:57:32.452
-All stop.
-All stop, aye.

00:57:38.834 --> 00:57:40.669
Now, all hands, bury the dead.

00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:42.212
Now, all hands, bury the dead.

00:57:48.969 --> 00:57:51.555
Ship's company. Attention!

00:57:54.766 --> 00:57:55.767
Salute!

00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:01.398
Firing line, half right, face!

00:58:02.024 --> 00:58:04.902
Anthony Pisani,
gunner's mate, third class.

00:58:04.985 --> 00:58:06.945
Ready. Fire!

00:58:08.822 --> 00:58:12.534
Daniel Marx, seaman, second. Ready. Fire!

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.208
George Cleveland, messmate. Ready. Fire!

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.385
Ready. Two!

00:58:40.771 --> 00:58:43.023
Distress rocket at rear of convoy!

00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:46.443
-Left standard rudder.
-Left standard rudder. Aye, sir.

00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:49.363
Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
Eagle has been hit.

00:58:49.446 --> 00:58:54.409
I am going to his aid, rear of the convoy.
Maintain your sweep. Go easy on your fuel.

00:58:54.493 --> 00:58:56.328
-Aye, sir.
-Aye, aye, sir.

00:59:03.293 --> 00:59:05.212
-Messenger, my glasses.
-Aye, sir.

00:59:05.295 --> 00:59:08.006
-Meet her.
-Aye, sir. Heading up the lane.

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:11.218
-Right standard rudder.
-Right standard rudder. Aye, sir.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.766
-Meet her.
-Meet her.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:20.060
-All ahead flank.
-All ahead flank. Aye, sir.

00:59:35.784 --> 00:59:37.077
-Messenger.
-Sir.

00:59:45.169 --> 00:59:46.378
-Mister Harbutt.
-Sir.

00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.546
That's Eagle and Cadena.

00:59:47.629 --> 00:59:49.464
Circle them at one mile
to cover the rescue.

00:59:49.548 --> 00:59:53.427
-Helm, left standard rudder. Come to 225.
-Left standard rudder...

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.054
Eagle, Greyhound. What is your status?

00:59:56.847 --> 00:59:59.516
We were hit forward of the engine room
and have a fire below deck.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.809
Some casualties.

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.354
The Kong Gustav was hit first,
sank in three minutes.

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:05.689
We saw no survivors.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:07.816
It's a bad afternoon, sir.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.152
How seaworthy are you?

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:13.947
We have a five-degree list at starboard,
and we're down at the stern,

01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:16.074
but we'll tow all right up to five knots.

01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:18.911
We have a flap of plate sticking up,
scooping in the sea.

01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:21.163
The list gets worse if we make any speed.

01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:23.957
We must keep you afloat, Eagle.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.460
We'll do all the sea allows, sir.

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:29.671
Very well. Greyhound out.

01:00:57.241 --> 01:00:58.992
I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.370
Very well. We're steady on course 225.

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:03.997
And we're at standard speed
with fuel conservation.

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:05.582
I relieve you, sir.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.461
Sir?

01:01:10.295 --> 01:01:13.215
Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck and the conn.

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:14.758
Very well.

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:18.846
Mister Carling,
Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots.

01:01:18.929 --> 01:01:21.974
Continue circling.
We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy.

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:24.935
Sonar, standard sweep to starboard.

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:27.771
Sonar, Bridge.
Search to starboard, standard pattern.

01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:43.996
Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound, Eagle.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.127
Greyhound.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:52.379
Request permission to abandon ship, sir.

01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:55.090
The collision mats were not big enough.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:58.468
We have a 15-degree list now,
and the main deck is underwater.

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:02.181
Well, I'm sure you've done all you could.
Permission granted.

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:06.185
She's been a good home, sir.
It's been an honor sailing with you.

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.437
We'll be praying for you.
Godspeed, Captain.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.689
Thank you for a job well done.

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:33.587
Thank you, Cleveland.

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:35.631
I'm Pitts, sir.

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:38.592
-Thank you.
-Sir.

01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:54.191
I need Mister Cole.

01:02:57.653 --> 01:03:00.364
XO requested, bridge.
XO requested, bridge.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:05.869
You wanted to see me, skip?

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.090
I've lost Eagle.

01:03:18.173 --> 01:03:22.636
Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges
and fuel, as are we.

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:25.764
I can offer only scant protection
to the convoy.

01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:28.350
We need air cover, Charlie.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:31.228
Do--

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:41.154
Do I break radio silence
with a message to the Admiralty?

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:44.449
Or does that let the wolf pack know
just how vulnerable we are?

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:45.909
What would the message be?

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:49.329
"Help needed urgently."

01:03:50.163 --> 01:03:52.165
No. "Help needed." That means "urgently."

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.043
"Needed" isn't needed. Just "help."

01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:58.172
That's all the Admiralty needs to hear
for a modified rendezvous point.

01:03:58.255 --> 01:04:00.424
The Germans might miss a message
as short as that.

01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:04.678
I wouldn't need to take this risk
if I'd been smarter yesterday.

01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:07.723
What you did yesterday got us to today.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:11.602
It's not enough, Charlie.
Not nearly enough.

01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.575
Message from the Admiralty, sir.

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.120
Some of it's badly scrambled, sir.
I've done my best with it.

01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:33.874
-XO to the bridge.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:36.710
What are these scrambles?

01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:39.838
I think coded numerals, sir.
But I'm sure of that.

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.508
"Expect aircraft.

01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:45.177
His challenge, 'Uncle William.'
Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'"

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:47.596
Captain?

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.806
Charlie. Message from Admiralty.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.600
Reinforcements dispatched.

01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:54.728
But it's only partially deciphered.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.271
Put together a team,
see what else is there.

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.356
Aye, aye, sir.

01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:19.127
Greyhound!

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.715
Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:28.262
We can always find you
in the night to kill you.

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:29.346
Escorts, Greyhound.

01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:31.932
-Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
-Divert all further TBS traffic

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:33.475
to channel Hotel. Execute.

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:37.729
Thought these were numerals,
but it was "Point X-ray."

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.940
"Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray."

01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:42.609
-How soon?
-Something like four hours, skip.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:45.070
Sir.

01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.356
-Messenger.
-Yes, sir.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.277
Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.361
Aye, sir.

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:47.758
Thank you. Return those.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.691
I've got two contacts bearing 099...

01:07:04.775 --> 01:07:07.402
Combat reports two pips,
starboard bow. Bearing 099.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.862
The other at 168, sir.

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:11.323
-Boatswain, take us to white.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:14.785
Charlie, these pips.

01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:17.996
Yes, sir, we got two skunks
showing on surface radar.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.540
They're heading straight for us.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:22.501
Just two hours to the rendezvous point,
Ernie, God willin'.

01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:30.759
All escorts, Greyhound. I have
two surface targets off to starboard.

01:07:30.843 --> 01:07:32.511
Maintain your screens.

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:35.931
Mister Watson,
bring us up to general quarters.

01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:37.432
-General quarters.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:41.186
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.897
Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
I am engaging targets.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.441
Request permission to come down there
and bounce 'em with you, sir.

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.861
-Negative, Dicky. Maintain your screen.
-Aye, sir.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.030
-Messenger.
-Sir.

01:07:54.032 --> 01:07:55.367
I'd like more coffee, please.

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.286
Aye, sir.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.838
Greyhound.

01:08:08.547 --> 01:08:10.549
Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:15.429
Did you think you had slipped away
from this Gray Wolf?

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:19.765
No, you did not. You will not.

01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:24.770
The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:27.399
not the hound on the run.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:31.819
You and your comrades will die today.

01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:33.404
Conn, Combat.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:35.908

Belay. Meet her. Meet her.

01:09:33.298 --> 01:09:34.883
Aye, sir. Holding course.

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.444

01:09:54.528 --> 01:09:56.947
Starboard slow astern! Port ahead full!

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.032
Starboard slow astern!
Port ahead full!

01:10:14.965 --> 01:10:16.758
All hands, brace for collision!

01:10:32.983 --> 01:10:35.402
Meet her! Steer straight
for that pip at 119!

01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:36.904
-119. Aye, aye, sir.
-All ahead full.

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:39.865

Conning tower, dead ahead!

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.206
We must have hit her!

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.378
Charlie! Lay a course to open the arcs
of fire aft! We'll hit 'em broadside!

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:37.798
Left full rudder, slow to two-thirds.
After batteries, fire as you bear.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.763
All mounts, local control!

01:11:44.847 --> 01:11:47.140
Target will be fine on our starboard bow!

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:48.642
Fire as they bear!

01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:51.728
Weapons, Bridge. All mounts,
local control. Fire as they bear.

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:18.130
Second sub spotted!

All mounts, local control!
Get those guns around!

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:33.395

Mounts 41 and 42,

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:45.240
open fire to mark the target
for that aircraft!

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:47.159
...mark target for that aircraft.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.525
Good work.

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:42.631
Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck.

01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:44.258
Very well.

01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:46.802
Messenger.

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:50.222
-Yes, sir.
-Write this.

01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:53.475
"To Comconvoy and all escorts:

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:58.647
Sonar reports no contacts.
Radar reports no contacts.

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.775
All escorts, resume station."

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:03.777
-Send it.
-Aye, sir.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.658
My heading is 290, sir.

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:12.244
-Very well. Steady as she goes.
-Steady as she goes, sir.

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.872

-All ahead standard. Aye, sir.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.636
Forward Lookout reports ship
starboard bow.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.889
Bearing 110. Range eight miles.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.648
-Message, sir.
-Read it out.

01:14:41.732 --> 01:14:43.734
"Admiralty to Greyhound. Welcome.

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:46.445
Kindly make verbal report
to Diamond on TBS."

01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:56.288
Diamond, Greyhound. Diamond, Greyhound.
Do you hear me?

01:14:56.872 --> 01:15:00.459
Loud and clear, Greyhound.
We hear you had a bit of a rough go of it.

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:03.712
Yes, sir. In the last 48 hours,

01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:08.258
we've lost seven ships from the convoy.
Two others were damaged.

01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:11.345
And the condition of your command?
How are you holding up?

01:15:11.428 --> 01:15:14.723
I took a round from a sub
on our portside deck. Three were killed.

01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:16.099
But you are seaworthy?

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:20.103
Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him
out on the surface, and we got him.

01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:22.564
My escort group sank three others.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.859
Four U-boats? Bloody good job, Greyhound.

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:31.031
We will be relieving you now
and taking the convoy on to Liverpool.

01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:32.449
You take Dicky and Harry

01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:34.826
and make best speed
to the naval yard in Londonderry.

01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:41.834
Sir, I request I stay with the convoy.
I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed.

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:45.838
No, that's an order, Commander.
We'll see the convoy on from here.

01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:47.840
I need you to take Dicky and Harry
back home.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:51.051
They're not fit to stay in the game,
understood? Off to Derry with you.

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:52.135
Aye, aye, sir.

01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:55.472
Tell me, Greyhound, just curious,

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:57.683
how many crossings
does that make for you now?

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.269
This was my first, sir.

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:02.437
Unbelievable.

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:05.691
Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier.
Admirable show, Commander.

01:16:05.774 --> 01:16:06.900
Thank you, sir.

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:23.458
Dicky, Harry. Greyhound.

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.043
-Dicky here.
-Harry here.

01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:26.962
You are relieved of your screening duties.

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:30.007
Form starboard echelon on me
at the head of the convoy.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:33.510
We will depart on 087 for Londonderry.

01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:35.012
Aye, aye, sir.

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:36.138
Aye, sir.

01:16:58.285 --> 01:16:59.453
Messenger.

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.164
-Messenger.
-Sir.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.544
-Signal Bridge. Send it.
-Signal Bridge. Aye, sir.

01:17:07.628 --> 01:17:10.297
Commodore is signaling
five minutes to course change, Captain.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.549
Very well. Take us up the lane.

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:14.968
When we clear the lead ships,
turn right to 087.

01:17:15.052 --> 01:17:17.095
-Dodge, James, starboard echelon.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:19.348
Steady on 087. Starboard echelon.

01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:22.059
-Helm, mark your head.
-Mark 083, sir.

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:23.685
Very well. Keep her so.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:25.479
Steady as I go. Aye, sir.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.582
Mister Carling, she's all yours.

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:49.211
I will be in my cabin if you need me.

01:17:50.379 --> 01:17:51.380
Aye, aye, sir.

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:34.710
"I thank you, my heavenly Father,

01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:36.670
that you have graciously kept me this day.

01:20:36.753 --> 01:20:40.340
Into your hands I commend myself,
my body and soul. Amen."
