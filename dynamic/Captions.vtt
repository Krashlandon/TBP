CORALINE: So what do you think
is in the other apartment?

00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:10.029
I don't know.

00:42:10.113 --> 00:42:11.948
Not a family of
Jones imposters.

00:42:12.783 --> 00:42:15.076
Then why'd you
lock the door?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.497
I found some rat crap,
and I thought
you'd feel safer.

00:42:20.082 --> 00:42:24.544
They're jumping mice, Mom,
and the dreams
aren't dangerous.

00:42:24.628 --> 00:42:27.672
They're the most fun
I've had since
we've moved here.

00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:29.173
Your school
might be fun.

00:42:29.258 --> 00:42:31.926
With those stupid uniforms?
Right.

00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:35.096
Had to give it a try.

00:42:48.193 --> 00:42:50.194
How do you feel
about a mustard,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.321
ketchup, salsa
wrap for lunch?

00:42:52.406 --> 00:42:54.156
Are you kidding me?

00:42:54.616 --> 00:42:56.534
Had to go food shopping,
anyway.

00:42:56.618 --> 00:42:59.370
Dad's planning
something special.

00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:01.289
Grossgusting.

00:43:01.373 --> 00:43:02.456
You wanna come along?

00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:04.166
You can pick out
something you like.

00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:06.210

if things go well today,
I promise I'll make it up.

That's what
you always say.

00:43:18.307 --> 00:43:19.807
Won't be long.

00:43:20.726 --> 00:43:22.685
But I might be.

00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:04.894

Miss Spink and Miss Forcible
have invited you
downstairs after lunch.

00:44:34.299 --> 00:44:36.592

00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:57.613
Not the quiet Wybie.
The one that talks too much.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.908
You must be the other cat.

00:45:00.992 --> 00:45:04.995
No, I'm not
the other anything. I'm me.

00:45:05.622 --> 00:45:08.374
Um... I can see you
don't have button eyes,

00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:12.044
but if you're the same cat,
how can you talk?

00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:14.630
I just can.

00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:17.049
Cats don't talk at home.

00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:18.509
No?
Nope.

00:45:18.593 --> 00:45:22.346
Well, you're clearly
the expert on these things.

00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:25.975
After all,
I'm just a big fat wuss puss.

00:45:26.977 --> 00:45:28.352
Come back. Please?

00:45:28.437 --> 00:45:31.230
I'm sorry I called you that.
I really am.

00:45:31.314 --> 00:45:32.565
How'd you get here?

00:45:32.649 --> 00:45:35.317
I've been coming
here for a while.

00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:40.239
It's a game we play.

00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:44.702
She hates cats and
tries to keep me out,

00:45:44.786 --> 00:45:46.287
but she can't, of course.

00:45:46.371 --> 00:45:48.581
I come and go
as I please.

00:45:48.665 --> 00:45:50.583
The other mother
hates cats?

00:45:50.667 --> 00:45:53.753
Not like any mother
I've ever known.

00:45:53.837 --> 00:45:56.172
What do you mean?
She's amazing.

00:45:56.923 --> 00:46:02.094
You probably think this world
is a dream come true,
but you're wrong.

00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:04.472
The other Wybie told me so.

00:46:04.556 --> 00:46:06.724
That's nonsense.
He can't talk.

00:46:06.808 --> 00:46:08.893
Perhaps not to you.

00:46:08.977 --> 00:46:13.314
We cats, however,
have far superior senses
than humans,

00:46:13.398 --> 00:46:15.775
