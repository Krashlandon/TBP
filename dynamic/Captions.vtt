WEBVTT

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.658
Huntrix!

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:39.706
Huntrix!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.838
Huntrix!

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.716
The world will know you as pop stars,

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.343
but you will be much more than that.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.888
You will be Hunters.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.607
Demons have always haunted our world,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.822
stealing our souls and channeling strength
back to their king, Gwi-Ma.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.826
Until heroes arose to defend us.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:22.082
Born with voices
that could drive back the darkness.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.502
Singing songs of courage and hope.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.880
But Hunters are more than warriors.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:36.262
Our music ignites the soul
and brings people together.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.223
With this connection,

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:42.352
the first Hunters
created a shield to protect our world,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.812
the Honmoon.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.527
Every generation,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.324
a new trio of Hunters
is chosen to fulfill our ultimate duty.

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:59.160
A barrier so strong it is impenetrable,

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.748
that will keep demons and Gwi-Ma
from our world forever,

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.917
the Golden Honmoon.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.837
And now, that duty falls to you.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.423
That victory is within your reach.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.551
It is your voices,

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:18.179
your song,
that will create the Golden Honmoon.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.430
Yes, Celine.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.728
Let's go, Huntrix!

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.732
We love Huntrix!

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.777
Mira's my favorite.
She's the visual and lead dancer.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.279
Nobody can move like Mira.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.447
She's the black sheep of her family.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.866
Even though she's so cool.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.577
Who else could wear a sleeping bag
to the Met Gala?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.413
-She's our role model.
-She's the best. Love her.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.457
-We're here for Zoey!
-The rapper and lyricist.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.334
She grew up in America.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.086
Somewhere called Burbank, USA.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.921
She's the cutest maknae.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.882
But when she raps, she goes hard.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.926
She gets real scary.
So scary, like, "You better watch out."

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.136
We love Rumi!

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.804
-She's pop-star royalty.
-Uh-huh!

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.849
Her mom, a Sunlight Sister,
died when she was a baby.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.268
But Celine raised her,
and built Huntrix around her.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.729
Rumi's voice is just incredible. Like…

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.773
It brings us to tears!

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:16.154
They're taking a break, and they need it,
but we're gonna miss them so much!

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.914
Everyone look alive!

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:30.752
All right. Looking good over there. Okay.
Ready? Ready. But where are the girls?

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.171
What? What? Where are they going?

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.007
Okay, this is our biggest show yet.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.383
The most songs.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.968
The most moves.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.803
Which means the most carb loading.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.680
For the fans!

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.266
I need 10,000 calories
to get through the choreo.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.393
A thousand percent. A gajillion percent.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.354
Man, that's not even a real number.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:50.647
It is for our fans.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.440
Ah!

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.779
Our fans deserve the best.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.700
Okay, time for our pre-game ramyeon!

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.704
Happy fans, happy Honmoon!

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.331
There's no water in these.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.666
Um, excuse me, miss?

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.127
-Yes, Miss Hunter… ix?
-We asked for hot water…

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.673
Right away.
You're welcome. Arrideverci. Goodbye.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.675
Uh, okay.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.928
-Hi, Bobby!
-Yeah, hi!

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.847
-Um, what are you doing?
-About to eat our pre-show ramyeon.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.766
Pre-show? What about the show-show?

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.851
-Hey, that's my phone!
-We love you!

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.603
Oh, we love you too!

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.523
That's so sweet.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.525
Yo! I just got this!

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.776
-Uh…
-Sick.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.736
Gimme that! Why are you so late?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.031
-Late?
-Fifty thousand fans are waiting for you.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.450
They made cute signs and everything.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.203
How can you be late? I wish you were here.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.247
Keep your shirt on.
We'll be there in three.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.875
I didn't even get to finish my ramyeon!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.919
Why do they always interrupt our snacking?

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.171
They will face my wrath!

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.465
-Um, excuse me?
-Please take your seat.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.467
We don't have time. You're a demon, right?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.802
What do you mean?

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.388
You're smiling all weird,
watering plants with coffee,

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.431
and those guys?

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:07.348
Come on.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.185
-Oh, we were just--
-Oh, look! Patterns.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.603
Oh, these? These are just…

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:16.858
The rest of you can come out.
We're in a hurry!

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.653
Oh, you got the patterns.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.363
Now you gotta die.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.407
The only ones dying tonight are your--

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:30.705
Uh, I said,
the only ones dying tonight are your--

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.707
I'm sorry, what?

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.209
Your fans! We're gonna eat your fans!

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.210
Whoa!

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.211
-No.
-No, thank you!

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.129
No, no, no.

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:39.172
Not our fans.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.923
When you mess with our fans…

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.967
We need to make it hurt.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.765
Ugh, you came at a bad time

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.933
But you just crossed the line

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.354
You wanna get wild?
Okay, I'll show you wild

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.315
Better come right, better luck trying
Gettin' to our level!

00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:00.360
'Cause you might die, never the time
Tryin' to start a battle!

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:03.363
Bleeding isn't in my blood!
Ppyeosokbuteo dalaseo!

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.282
Beating you is what I do
Do, do, yeah!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.534
Body on body
I'm naughty, not even sorry!

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.496
When you pull up, I'll pull up
A little late to the party!

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:12.413
Nah, nah!

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.625
Locked, loaded, born for this!
No point in avoiding it!

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.711
Annoyed a bit? Bureul bichwo!
Da bikyeo ni ap gireul bbaetgyeo!

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.714
Knocking you out like a lullaby!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.342
Hear that sound ringing in your mind!

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.928
Better sit down for the show!

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.515
'Cause I'm gonna show you
How it's done, done, done!

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.479
Huntrix don't miss
How it's done, done, done!

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.107
Hey!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.026
Huntrix don't quit
How it's done, done, done!

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.196
Run, run, we run the town!

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.199
Whole world playing our sound!

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:51.411
Turning up, it's going down!

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.747
Huntrix show this
How it's done, done, done!

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.374
Yeah, this plane's trashed.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.669
Okay, let's do this.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.713
Something about when you come
For the crown that's so humbling

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.967
Gapiagi wai geurae? Meonjeo geondeuryeo
Wae? Ijeya pogi hae, what?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.053
Run up, you're done up!
From sun up to sundown, so come play!

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.098
Won either way, one in a million
We kill! Want it? Okay!

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.184
Heels, nails, blade, mascara!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.937
Fit check for my napalm era!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.940
Need to beat my face
Make it cute and savage!

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:23.317
Mirror, mirror on my phone
Who's the baddest?

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.735
Us? Hello!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.655
Knocking you out like a lullaby!

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:30.616
Hear that sound ringing in your mind!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.827
-Better sit down for the show!
-It's them!

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.620
'Cause I'm gonna show you!

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.832
-I'm gonna show you!
-I'm gonna show you!

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.208
How it's done!

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.086
-I don't talk, I bite! Full of venom!
-Cool costume!

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.881
-Spittin' facts! You know that's…
-How it's done!

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:48.092
Okay, I know I ramble
But when shootin' my words, I go Rambo!

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.804
-Took blood and tears to look natural!
-That's how it's done!

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.807
Hear our voice unwavering

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.727
Till our song defeats the night

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:04.650
Making fear afraid to breathe
Till the dark meets the light!

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.319
How it's done, done, done!

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:12.366
Run, run, we run the town!
Whole world playing our sound!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.453
Turnin' up, it's goin' down!

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:16.996
Huntrix show this

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.498
How it's done, done, done!

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.501
We hunt you down, down, down!

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.504
We got you now, now, now!

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.256
We show you how, how, how!

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.883
Huntrix don't miss

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.093
How it's done, done, done!

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:11.801
Let me guess. They got away again?

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:15.304
The Hunters, they're too strong.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.223
I understand.

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:19.392
You… You do?

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:22.937
I understand you are weak!

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.438
Pathetic!

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:25.898
Useless!

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.191
All of you!

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.778
Don't you idiots know?

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.074
Once the Hunters turn the Honmoon gold,
it's over for us!

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.083
There once was a mighty demon king.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.169
Stop me if you've heard this one before.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.088
He was in total control.

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.715
He feasted on souls.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:54.051
The world trembled when he roared.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.597
But then some Hunters sang some songs.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:00.766
Now all he does is starve.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.395
Can't get at the souls,
and his flame grows cold.

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:07.356
Just a whisper in the dark.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.402
And will he let the fire go out?

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.697
Is this the end of him now?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.825
Dying king with a crumbling crown?

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:22.204
Will he let the fire go out?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.042
I let you keep that voice, Jinu.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.419
And you dare to mock me with it?

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:30.254
I'm not here to mock you.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.881
I'm here to help you.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.008
It's time for a new strategy.

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:37.887
We fight the Hunters
where they least expect it.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.098
Go after the very thing
that powers the Honmoon.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.643
The fans.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.397
A demon boy band?

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.863
What makes you think that could work?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.708
-Yeah. That's totally gonna work.
-Yeah. 100%.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.169
Okay.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:11.295
I know you, Jinu.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.339
In 400 years,

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:17.635
you've never done a single thing
that didn't serve yourself.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.471
What do you want?

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.350
The memories. I want them erased.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.854
Did we just see gold?

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.857
-Yeah. I can't believe we're doing it.
-It's so exciting!

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.528
Okay. You know what this means.
It's time to release the song.

00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.114
-Yes! It's finally time!
-We're gonna turn it gold. Yay!

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.615
-The moment we waited for.
-Yes!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.659
Whoa. That was weird.

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:44.995
-Good thing we're taking a break.
-Yeah. Sounds like you need the rest.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:48.207
-Yeah. Just need a little water.
-Did someone say water?

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.208
Hi, Bobby!

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.418
Water! Now!

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.795
What a way to end the world tour!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:56.090
That finale with the guy
in the demon suit exploding into confetti?

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:59.009
-So chill.
-Those special effects looked amazing.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.345
Yeah. "Special effects."

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.013
This is gonna break the bank,

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.182
but, ooh, look at these social numbers!

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.517
They're off the charts!

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.311
And to celebrate,
I booked you a week-long staycation

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.398
at the fanciest,
most exclusive relaxation resort in Korea.

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.191
Sorry, Bobby. We already have plans.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.234
What? What plans?

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.153
We got the hottest ticket in town.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.864
-To our couch! Couch!
-To our couch! Couch!

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.741
Bobby, you should go enjoy the resort.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.410
This tour has been grueling for everyone.
You deserve it.

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.579
Me? Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:30.082
Just kidding. Robe me. I'm a 34 short.
See you in a couple weeks, girls!

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.625
Bye, Bobby!

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.337
All right. Two weeks of vacation.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.256
Yes. Vacation.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.217
Step one…

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:44.513
Mmm! I can't wait to eat kimbap
and stare at the ceiling.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.056
I already picked a movie for us.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.559
It's actually a list
of 700 two-second videos

00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:49.935
all about turtles.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:53.355
-Mm-hm.
-Sounds super boring. I'm so down.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.899
Let's do this.

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:58.652
I got you on my radar
Soon you're gonna be with me

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:03.199
My strategy, strategy
Will get ya, get ya, baby

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.950
It's time.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.996
Couch! Couch! Couch!

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.582
Couch!

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:16.378
-Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.Yeah.
-So relaxing.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.465
-Hey. Have a good break?
-Huh?

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:23.385
What? No. We literally just sat down!

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.638
Why are you in your new costume?

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:26.847
Rumi, you didn't.

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.308
Did you announce the new single?

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:31.519
-The promo starts tomorrow-- Tonight?
-Tonight?

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.395
-Rumi, no!
-No!

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.857
-But the pajamas! But no.No!
-No!

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.026
Girls, you won't believe this!

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.487
-Bobby!
-No more relaxy time!

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.241
Your new single is on fire!
Everyone's listening to it!

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.158
Yay!

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.953
So let's go promo!

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.956
-New single?
-New single?

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.042
-New single?
-New Huntrix?

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.431
I was a ghost

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.599
I was alone

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:15.020
Eo du wojin, ap gil sok e

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.189
Given the throne

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.192
I didn't know how to believe

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.362
I was the queen that I'm meant to be

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.822
I lived two lives

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:30.619
Tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.663
Called a problem child

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:35.165
'Cause I got too wild

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.877
But now that's how I'm getting paid!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.211
Kkeut eop si on stage!

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.338
I'm done hiding now

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.256
I love it already!

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:46.427
I'm shining like I'm born to be!

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.387
We're dreaming hard

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.472
We came so far

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.726
Now I believe!

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.769
We're going up, up, up

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.563
It's our moment!

00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:59.231
Together we're glowing!

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.150
-Gonna be golden!
-Play it again!

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.694
You see my head bobbing?

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:05.446
Tell us about that new single.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:07.907
"Golden." It's the story of us.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.576
It's a song about who we are,
and where we're going next.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.454
And the first live performance is tonight!

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:17.249
Now I'm shining Like I'm born to be…

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.544
It's the beginning
of a new chapter for us.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:25.049
For the whole world.
We're so excited to show you what's next.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:33.432
Waited so long
To break these walls down

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:37.061
To wake up and feel like me

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:41.398
Put these patterns all in the past now

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:45.653
And finally live
Like the girl they all see

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:48.238
No more hiding

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.990
I'll be shining

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:53.243
Like I'm born to be!

00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:57.790
'Cause we are Hunters, voices strong

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:01.377
And I know I believe!

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.671
We're going up, up, up

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.255
It's our moment!

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.299
You know together we're glowing

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:10.177
Gonna be, gonna be golden! Oh!

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.431
Up, up, up with our voices
Yeong won h kkae jil su eop neun…

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.725
-Rumi's voice!
-I can't wait to hear her live!

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.186
Whoa, I'm done hiding

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:20.396
Oh, sorry.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.897
Now I'm shining

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.274
Like I'm born to b--

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:26.777
Huh?

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.278
You okay?

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.281
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's take it again. From the top.

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.993
I'm done hiding

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.036
Now I'm shining

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.955
Like I'm born to–

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.291
Um, Rumi, are you okay?

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.876
Do you need some water?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.212
I just need five. I'm gonna take five.

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:47.965
-Five minutes? We go live in ten!
-Um…

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:51.593
Okay, I can handle this.
I'm not having a nervous breakdown.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:56.348
Visualize there's not 10,000 fans
at the door screaming and sounding scary.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.683
Mayday!

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:01.020
There's 10,000 fans at the door
screaming and sounding scary!

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:05.566
Okay.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.993
My voice? Oh, no. No.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:27.046
We are Hunters, voices strong

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:31.383
Slaying demons with our song

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:35.554
Fix the world and make it right

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:40.559
When darkness finally meets the light

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:45.397
-Celine, do Hunters kill all demons?
-Yes.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:48.150
So everything that has patterns?

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:51.570
Cover those up.
You only have those because--

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:53.405
My dad was a demon?

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:57.201
You're not one of them, Rumi.
You're a Hunter, like your mother was.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:01.622
When the Honmoon is sealed,
all demons will be gone from this world.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.791
And so will your patterns.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.043
-So these will be gone?
-Yes.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.586
Those will be gone.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.425
You always say no, Rumi.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.886
You're so modest. It's just the bathhouse.

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:18.472
Maybe some other time. You guys go ahead.

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:20.724
-Every time.
-Mm-hm.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.520
Maybe they'll understand.

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.604
No, Rumi.

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:28.857
Nothing can change
until your patterns are gone.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.624
No more hiding

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.751
I'll be shining

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.754
Like I'm born to be!

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:55.759
'Cause we are Hunters, voices strong

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:59.263
And I know I believe!

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.436
How am I supposed to fix the world,

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:11.024
fix me, when I don't have my voice?

00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.028
Why now, when I'm so close?

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.407
Why?

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.075
Why?!

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:31.128
We are Hunters, voices strong

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.560
I… I'm sorry about the show.

00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:49.271
Rumi, it's okay.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.314
Bobby can handle it.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.318
-Hi, Bobby!
-Girls, I can't handle this!

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.988
There's thousands of disappointed fans,
and the network is losing their minds.

00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:01.283
Okay, this is why you pay me 3%.
Okay, back off!

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:04.119
My girls will sing when they're ready.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:08.624
It's okay. We can reschedule
another live show within days.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.835
I… I don't know
if that's going to be possible.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.712
My voice, it's in trouble.

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:15.339
Wait, in trouble?

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:17.674
Then why did you
push up the "Golden" release?

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:23.013
Because we're so close,
and it's so important.

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:25.057
Okay, how do we handle this?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.726
What do we tell the fans?
Maybe we should call Celine?

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.436
We know what she'd say, Zoey.

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.771
Oh, right.

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:35.651
"We are Hunters. Voices strong.
Your faults and fears must never be seen."

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.319
Whoa.

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:40.447
-You sound exactly like her.
-Yeah, that's how she says it.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.784
-No. We gotta hide it and fix it.
-For sure. We have to hide it. Mm-hm.

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:47.537
Rumi, why don't we take a break?
We'll skip the Idol Awards this year and--

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.039
No. No way.

00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:50.832
It's our most important show.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.418
It's when we strengthen the Honmoon
for the entire year.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.670
We can't skip it.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:55.921
We just can't.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.048
Not when I'm so close.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.718
Hey, we'll get through this.

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.971
We can get through anything. Together.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:08.892
Okay. We have two weeks
to fix Rumi's voice. Any ideas?

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.894
I do have one idea.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:11.937
Just one?

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.898
Actually, 57,
but let's start with my favorite.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.901
Don't worry. It's totally legit.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.486
He's got this special tonic.

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:23.156
Apparently, it can heal anything
from sore throats to relationships.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.283
Ssh! Quietly, Zoey.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.994
-Why are there so many people today?
-Down that alleyway.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:28.620
Free concert? It's at noon.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:29.997
Who are the Saja Boys?

00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:34.042
Yep, about as legit as I expected.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:37.045
Earthy and herby. Smells legit to me.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:41.133
-Yay! That's the spirit!
-Hurry, before someone sees us.

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:45.387
Huh?

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.433
Eh?!

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:52.811
Rumi Nim.Sit. Sit.

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:57.232
You need no introduction.
So, a problem with your voice.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.234
Yes. So we need
one of your awesome tonics.

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.028
Something that will work super fast.

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:03.697
Okay, let me see.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.699
-Ah!
-Uh-uh-uh.

00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:10.996
In order to heal a part,
we must understand the whole.

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:16.710
-Uh…
-I see.

00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:19.212
I see…

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:24.926
No. Actually, I don't see.
Very strange. You have lots of walls up.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.887
Whoa! He's so good, right?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.014
So many walls.

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:31.224
Walls?I don't have walls.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:33.435
Uh, yeah, you do. He is kind of good.

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.687
-I'm just trying to stay focused.
-Hm…

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:39.941
Focus is good, but focusing on one part
leads to ignoring other parts,

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:42.277
making you separated, isolated.

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.821
-Ooh! Emotionally closed off?
-Yes! Yes!

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.240
She's also a workaholic,
doesn't know how to relax.

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.700
I know how to relax!

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.702
I bet she refuses to go to the bathhouse.

00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:52.412
Oh my gosh, yes!

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:55.374
-How did you even--
-Dude, we've been trying to take her…

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:57.042
Forever!

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:58.710
How is this helpful?

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.504
It's helping me a lot.

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:03.507
I can't believe you got all that wisdom
just from looking at her.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.884
Hm. I see…

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.677
Wait, why are you looking at me?

00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:11.264
Eagerness to please.
Maybe a little too eager.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.809
What? I'm not like that.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.603
-You'd tell me if I was like that, right?
-Um…

00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:17.604
Hm…

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.147
I see…

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.239
-Yeah, that's right.
-How does this help me get my voice back?

00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:30.075
As I said, to treat the part,

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:33.203
we must understand the whole.

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:36.498
That's great, but I thought
we were here just for your tonics.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.375
Just give us the voice juice.

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:42.170
Hm… I know just the tonics you need.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.885
Is that us?

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:51.596
Zoey.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.890
Your tonics are ready!

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:56.518
We got the tonics!

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.061
Yay! Once your is voice fixed,

00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:00.856
we can get back to the important stuff,
like the fans.

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.982
Totally. Nice.

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.775
-Fans!
-We can't let them see us!

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:04.860
Hurry!

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.445
Be cool. Look normal.

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.071
Oh yeah!

00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:10.282
Come on

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:11.491
Hm?

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:13.952
Take your time

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:19.749
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:22.836
So tonight

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.675
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:29.593
Just right

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:34.097
Mmm! Mmm!

00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:37.934
So hot.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:43.398
Ugh. You guys are so gross…

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:35.867
Uh…

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.328
-Huh?
-Watch yourself.

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:45.669
Watch my… Watch yourself!
Look at this mess!

00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:48.129
-Yeah. They're not even that cute.
-They're so bleh!

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.464
They're so…

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.091
No, they're…

00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:52.384
They're…

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:54.469
-I'm gonna throw up.
-Wait. What is that?

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:03.645
Ooh. Sorry!

00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:09.568
Hey, hey!

00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:11.903
Hey, hey!

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:13.530
Hey!

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:19.077
Don't want you, need you
Yeah, I need you to fill me up!

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.954
Masigo maysyeo bwa do…

00:26:21.037 --> 00:26:22.956
It's those stupid jerks again!

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.751
Got a feeling that, oh yeah
You could be everything that I need!

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.711
Taste so sweet…

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:29.129
These guys are a boy band?

00:26:29.212 --> 00:26:30.380
Makes me want more

00:26:30.463 --> 00:26:32.340
-Looking like snacks!
-You got it!

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.301
Take a big bite, want another bite!

00:26:34.384 --> 00:26:36.136
Neoui modeungeol nan wonhae!

00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:37.971
Neomalgon modu peonhae, peonhae…

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:42.809
Did he? One, two, three, four, five, six.
That jerk stole one of my pouches!

00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:45.145
Can’t let go, no, no, not tonight

00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:49.024
Jigeum dangiang nal
Bwa shigan eobtjana

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:52.736
Neon naegeoya imi algo itjana

00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.779
'Cause I need you to need me

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:56.489
I'm empty, you feed me

00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:59.075
So refreshing!

00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:00.452
My little soda pop!

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.871
You're all I can think of

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:04.831
Every drop I drink up

00:27:04.914 --> 00:27:06.708
You're my soda pop

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:08.460
My little soda pop

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:10.503
Cool me down, you're so hot

00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:12.839
Pour me up, I won't stop!

00:27:12.922 --> 00:27:14.215
You're my soda pop…

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.217
It is annoyingly catchy, though.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.136
It's infectious.

00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.892
They can make hearts out of thin air?

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:31.483
-They're demons!
-Magicians! Demons. Obviously demons.

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:34.569
Make me wanna flip the top!
Han mogume, you hit the spot!

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.322
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop
Soreum doda

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:38.948
It's gettin' hot…

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:40.241
Dang, they're good.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.535
Incredible. But a demon boy band? Why?

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:45.121
I don't care.
A demon's a demon. We kill them.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:48.583
-No, it's too public.
-What if they try to kill these people?

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:51.044
It doesn't look
like they're gonna hurt anyone.

00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:52.170
Huh?

00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:55.548
Nan jeoldae notchil su eopseo…

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.510
In fact,
it almost seems like they're nice demons?

00:27:58.593 --> 00:27:59.803
Demons are never nice!

00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:00.887
Don't eat that!

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.013
Ah! No.

00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:03.890
Don't touch that!

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:05.725
Come on, fill me up

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:09.562
Just can't get enough!

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:11.189
You're all I can think of

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:13.024
Every drop I drink up

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:15.652
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop…

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:18.988
They're coming after the fans.
We gotta stop this now.

00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.949
Pour me up, I won't stop!

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:22.409
You're my soda pop

00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.494
My little soda pop!

00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:30.458
You're my soda pop!

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.377
Gotta drink every drop!

00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:41.469
That's it for now.

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:44.097
See you tonight
on everyone's favorite variety show.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.099
Saja Boys love you!

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:47.350
My little soda pop!

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.814
-That was incredible.
-I liked that.

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:56.776
To be fair,
that's also something a magician would do.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.988
Oh, those are demons.
And we're gonna kill them.

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.823
Let's get battle ready.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.002
Let's go kill these guys.

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.503
Caw-caw!

00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:18.715
-Play!
-Play Games With Us!

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:20.800
Spicy challenge.

00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:24.095
Welcome back
to Who Can Chug the Most Hot Sauce?

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.556
Once they come off stage,

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:29.058
we'll jump down for the attack,
and these boys'll be…

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:30.393
Done, done, done.

00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.562
That's one flaming-hot Jinu.

00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:34.939
And Abby is down.

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.983
Mystery is history.

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:40.528
Looks like Romance is out
due to heartburn?

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.823
It's a dead heat
between my handsome co-host and Baby Saja.

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:45.074
Can our host catch up?

00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:46.743
So spicy! So spicy!

00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:50.163
He can't! Baby Saja is the winner!

00:29:50.246 --> 00:29:51.873
Goo goo, ga ga.

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:53.583
Come on. Wrap it up.

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:55.960
Hard to say goodbye when we're having fun.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.420
So hard. So hard.

00:29:57.504 --> 00:30:00.924
Then why say goodbye when we have
extra special guests coming up?

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:03.051
What is he doing?

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:06.095
Please welcome Huntrix!

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:08.765
I love you, Huntrix!

00:30:08.848 --> 00:30:13.895
We just wanted to stop by and congratulate
our hoobaes on their debut and--

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:18.900
And of course,
Play Games with Us! Bring out the slides!

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.443
Slide!

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:22.862
Oh no.We couldn't possibly.

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:25.406
In the balls! In the balls!

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.534
Sure. For the fans.

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:31.955
Wait. What the…

00:30:33.414 --> 00:30:34.582
What's happening?

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:35.792
Make it stop!

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.710
The leather has betrayed us!

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.091
And Huntrix is in the balls!

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.803
Well, this was fun.

00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:49.889
It was truly an honor
to share the stage with you.

00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:51.975
-So hot!
-And respectful!

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.727
Oh no. The honor is ours.

00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:56.104
-No, it was ours.
-It's ours.

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.565
-Ours. Ours…
-Ours. Ours…

00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:00.567
Oh, my back!

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.155
Let's go get these guys.

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:09.200
We finally get to go
to the bathhouse with Rumi!

00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:14.998
Men's?

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:19.460
Wow. Did you really follow us in here?

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.838
I knew they would.
That one's always looking at me.

00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:23.882
No we're not.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.259
You think we're just
gonna let you steal our fans?

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.844
You'll have to fight us for them.

00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:30.138
Yeah. Keep your hands off our Honmoon.

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.599
We're not here to fight.

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:33.683
They are.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:34.684
Water demons.

00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:36.686
Oh great. My favorite.

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:40.398
Get rid of the Hunters.
Then you can eat all the souls you want.

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:45.194
Don't let this
turn you off bathhouses, Rumi.

00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:47.739
It's usually really fun and relaxing.

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.741
Have fun. Oh!

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:50.950
Oh jeez.

00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:56.748
Whoa! Whoa!

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.249
Hey.

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:04.339
What's going on with the Honmoon?

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.673
It's getting worse.

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.800
We can't hold them. We need Rumi.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.138
Whoa! Mind the face.
I need it to steal your fans.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.230
You're strong.

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.447
A Hunter who's part demon?

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.202
Rumi, we need your help!

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.536
Rumi!

00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:39.707
-What are you doing? Where are you?
-Rumi, we need you!

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.509
-Rumi! Get in here.
-Rumi! We need you.

00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:50.718
-Rumi!
-Rumi!

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.700
Hey! This is the man's bathhouse.
Get out of here.

00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:14.784
Um, hi.

00:33:18.287 --> 00:33:20.498
My little soda pop

00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:22.875
My little soda pop

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.047
A Hunter who's part demon.

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.934
Saja Boys! Saja Boys!

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.353
I love you guys.

00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:44.355
Saja Boys.

00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:46.149
They're just like us.

00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:48.484
Oh, souls incoming.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.950
"My Little Soda Pop."

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.410
It's catchy.

00:33:57.493 --> 00:34:00.329
Surprisingly, your plan is working.

00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:03.791
I know, and that soul is just a starter.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:07.503
So let me get back to work,
and you'll be feasting in no time.

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:12.341
One of the Hunters bears my mark,
but I have no control over her.

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:13.301
This is good.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.261
This means she has shame.

00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:16.637
I'll find out what it is,

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:21.017
and we can use it
to destroy her and the Hunters for good.

00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:24.437
I've taught you well, Jinu.

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:31.778
How do we go from gold to this?

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.614
Look at all the weak spots.

00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:36.824
We've never seen the Honmoon
like this before.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.827
Gwi-Ma must know
we're so close to sealing it for good.

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.746
So he sends a demon boy band?

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:42.997
Well, it's working.

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.458
Don't worry.
I'm sure "Soda Pop" is just a fad.

00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:48.252
These boys will be old news by next week.
You'll see.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.130
-Girls?
-Hi, Bobby!

00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:53.049
It's a lot more serious than I thought.

00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:56.594
The Saja Boys have gone completely viral
after that variety show.

00:34:56.677 --> 00:34:58.137
They even have their own fandom.

00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:00.139
Join the Pride!

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:01.933
Cool me down, you're so hot

00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:03.935
Pour me up, I won't stop!

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:05.269
You're my soda pop…

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.480
-Bobby! Control those shoulders.
-Zoey!

00:35:07.563 --> 00:35:08.981
Wow, it is catchy.

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:12.318
Yeah, you're right, Zoey.
They're amazing, but they suck.

00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:14.987
I'm sorry. I've been glued
to this tiny screen for hours.

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:17.365
I just need to look away and…

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:18.533
Woo!

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.700
Relax, Bobby.

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.744
It's just social media numbers.

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.329
Not the end of the world.

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:29.627
This is the battle for hearts and minds.
A battle for the fans.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.255
And what's the biggest battlefield
of them all?

00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:34.132
-The Idol Awards.
-State Fair?

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:36.259
That's right. We have to crush that stage.

00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.302
Be better than
we've ever been with the show

00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:39.971
to end the Saja Boys for good.

00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:41.848
Zoey, we're gonna need a new song.

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:44.517
I got 23 notebooks
full of demon insults ready to go.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.102
Yeah! Let's make it 30 notebooks.

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:47.645
Mira, the choreography?

00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:49.188
Yep, making them hotter.

00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:50.940
Backup dancers, ready to go.

00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:54.402
We'll write a brand-new song.
A diss track to expose the Saja Boys.

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:58.698
And send those disgusting demons
back to the depths where they belong!

00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:00.366
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:01.409
Yeah!

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:02.410
Yeah!

00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:06.914
Yeah!

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.833
We're gonna kick their butts!

00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:10.084
That's my girls!

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:14.297
Not sure about this whole demon thing.
They seem nice, but loving the energy!

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:24.265
Okay, tonics. Let's do this. What?

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:29.270
Zoey.

00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:36.736
A Hunter who's part demon?

00:36:43.075 --> 00:36:46.162
Is that a bird wearing a tiny hat?

00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:49.999
What?

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:39.006
No. No, really. It's okay. Just leave it.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.010
What are you?

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.475
"Hello, friend."

00:37:51.143 --> 00:37:53.562
Jinu? Ji-- Jinu? Oh!

00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:54.480
Meet you?

00:37:54.563 --> 00:37:57.817
I'm not gonna meet you.
Who do you think you--

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.251
Okay, Jinu. Let's meet.

00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:53.998
-What?
-Wow. I wasn't expecting a hug, but--

00:38:54.081 --> 00:38:56.125
Jeez, okay, okay.

00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:59.211
Calm down. I thought the mannequin
was gonna be a fun icebreaker.

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:00.504
But I see I was wrong.

00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:01.589
Whoa!

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.175
-Hey! I just wanna talk.
-Talk?

00:39:04.258 --> 00:39:08.304
About your patterns?
But first, I wanna talk about those pants.

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.432
-Hm?
-Teddy bears and choo-choo trains? Really?

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:14.894
Choo-choo.

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.979
-You were supposed to be dead!
-Whoa. Hey!

00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.981
I could've told your friends what you are.

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.900
But I didn't, did I?

00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:22.818
Because they don't know.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.822
Ah, I did guess right.

00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.532
A demon girl.

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:29.784
Also Hunter.

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.120
Hiding, walking around free
in the human world.

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.123
-Just Hunter, not demon.
-Then how'd you get the patterns?

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.459
-That's none of your business.
-Huh.

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.544
I know what it feels like to have them.

00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:43.839
Feel? You're a demon.
Demons don't feel anything.

00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:47.385
Is that what you think?
That's all demons do. Feel.

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.220
Feel our shame, our misery.

00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:53.099
It's how Gwi-Ma controls us.
Do you not hear him in your ear?

00:39:53.182 --> 00:39:55.267
-What are you talking about?
-Huh.

00:39:55.851 --> 00:39:57.269
You're lucky.

00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:59.647
I'll never forget
the first time I heard him.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.358
That was 400 years ago.

00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.236
My family
was extremely poor and miserable.

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:09.198
I had a single possession to my name.
An old bipa.

00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:12.952
So I busked the streets,
but it didn't get me anywhere.

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.161
I was desperate.

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.496
We were starving.

00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:17.581
Then, I heard him.

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.875
You can't do anything for your family.

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.669
You're not good enough for them.

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:24.547
But I can help you be good enough.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:28.676
Overnight, my fate was changed.
I was praised for my voice.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.302
Even by the king himself.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.139
My family and I lived
on the palace grounds.

00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:36.142
Our bellies were finally full,
our clothes clean.

00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:37.435
We were happy.

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:42.481
But the patterns, they kept spreading
until they consumed me.

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:44.859
And I was condemned to the demon world.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.862
Prisoner of Gwi-Ma for all eternity.

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.990
My family lost everything.

00:40:51.073 --> 00:40:54.201
And without me,
they were even worse off than before.

00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:58.497
Every day since, I've been haunted
by the memory of failing them.

00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:03.252
You left them.
Left them behind. Failed them.

00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:06.881
These are a constant reminder of my shame.

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:09.091
A shame I can never escape.

00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:23.939
Yours are a reminder too.

00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:25.733
Of a shame of your own.

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:28.444
You don't know me.

00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:31.655
You know you can tell me. I'll understand.

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.825
I'm the only one who can.

00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:39.413
I'm nothing like you.

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.499
Denial. I get it.

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.669
I was once there too.
I'll be here when you're done pretending.

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:47.004
Until next time.

00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:48.631
There won't be a next time!

00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.766
You'll never beat us

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.726
Your plan will never work
We're gonna…

00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:05.481
This song sucks!

00:42:05.564 --> 00:42:08.234
We only have to write
the best diss track ever

00:42:08.317 --> 00:42:11.570
to crush the Idol Awards,
or there'll be a demon apocalypse.

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:13.572
No pressure at all.

00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:18.869
Yeah! We gotta get up close
and insult their stupid faces!

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.622
Their nasty, disgusting, not beautiful…

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.333
…perfectly dewy,

00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.377
symmetrical, shimmering…

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.504
Okay, enough! I'm taking these down!

00:42:28.587 --> 00:42:31.298
Just like how we're gonna
take down these boys!

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:36.178
Take down? Takedown!
That's the song! It's a takedown!

00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:38.305
So sweet, so easy on the eyes

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.932
But hideous on the inside

00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:41.392
-Nice.
-You like it?

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.644
Whole life spreading lies
But you can't hide

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.020
Baby, nice try

00:42:45.104 --> 00:42:46.689
Whoa. That's sounding good.

00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:48.440
I'm about to switch up these vi–

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:51.443
-Sorry, guys.
-No, take it easy.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:53.487
Yeah, rest that voice for Idol Awards.

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.115
This week's winner is "Soda Pop"
by the Saja Boys!

00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:58.033
So sweet, so easy on the eyes

00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.785
But hideous on the inside

00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:02.830
Whole life spreading lies
But you can't hide, baby, nice try!

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.915
I'm about to switch up these vibes

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.375
I finally opened my eyes

00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:10.045
It's time to kick you straight back
Into the night!

00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.381
Wait, that's the beat.

00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:14.049
Yeah, totally!

00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:18.012
Are you a prisoner too?
Is Gwi-Ma making you do this?

00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:21.849
-Mira.
-You okay?

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.601
Yeah, thanks for having my back.

00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:27.479
This week's winner is "Golden" by Huntrix!

00:43:28.856 --> 00:43:31.317
I'mma gear up and take you down!

00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:34.320
It's a takedown!

00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:37.197
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:40.576
A takedown, I'mma take you out
You'll break down like, "What?"

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:43.746
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
And it ain't gonna stop!

00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:44.997
Oh, how about…

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.208
"A demon with no feelings
Doesn't deserve to live" ?

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.293
It's so obvious!

00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:52.254
I'mma gear up and take you down!

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:53.756
Oh, oh

00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:55.215
It's a takedown!

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:56.800
Look!

00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:58.510
Takedown!

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:00.804
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:02.306
Join the Pride!

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.767
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.603
-Join the--
-Join the Pride!

00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:11.815
All right, team,
I know everything is all Saja, Saja, Saja,

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.693
but we're gonna turn it
into Huntrix, Huntrix, Huntrix!

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:16.195
Yay!

00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:19.448
These fans slept
on the sidewalk, overnight!

00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:22.660
Happy fans, happy Honmoon!

00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.912
Let's bring them in! Welcome.

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.914
Hey, single file, no pushing.

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:30.376
-And who should I make this out to?
-"To our biggest fans."

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.920
It's the Saja Boys!

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:36.048
It is an honor! Table, now!

00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:37.925
Joint signing!

00:44:38.425 --> 00:44:42.513
We lose half the fans?
The Saja Boys will sit with us!

00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:44.431
-What? Rumi?
-Rumi, what are you doing?

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.849
-Genius!
-Huh?

00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:47.518
Same table?

00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.186
We need every fan.

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.689
Hm. We keep meeting like this.

00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:55.651
I am not sitting with no Saja Boy--
What's up?

00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:01.281
-I didn't think you liked sharing.
-I love sharing.

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:04.159
Oh, so you shared
your secret with your friends?

00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:06.453
If only I could smash your demon face now!

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.497
Thanks for coming!

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.790
Should I tell them?

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:12.376
No, I'm gonna tell them. Eventually.

00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:13.377
Are you whispering?

00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:18.006
Your secret's safe with me.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:21.969
Oh, so cute!

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:22.886
Thanks for coming!

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.346
No! Bad Saja Boy!

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.223
-I'll sign first.
-No, I'll sign first.

00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:28.517
-No, I'll sign first.
-No, me! Me first!

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.728
Not gonna talk to someone
who's helping Gwi-Ma.

00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:32.187
I'm helping myself.

00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:35.232
Look, if I help him,
he's promised to erase my memories,

00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:37.443
and those voices in my head will be gone.

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:39.027
-Pathetic.
-I'm pathetic?

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:41.321
You can't even talk about your patterns.

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.158
You want me to talk about my patterns?

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:47.828
I hate them! Just like I hate all demons.
How I hate Gwi-Ma.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:51.623
If hate could defeat Gwi-Ma,
I would've done it a long time ago.

00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:52.541
Trust me.

00:45:53.459 --> 00:45:55.919
Excuse me, Mr. Jinu.

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.755
I made this for you.

00:45:57.838 --> 00:45:59.923
Uh, for me?

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:06.805
Maybe listen to those voices
instead of the ones in your head.

00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:11.643
Isn't he great?
Woo! Jinu, everybody! Yeah, Jinu!

00:46:11.727 --> 00:46:13.687
"Woo, Jinu"?

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:15.481
Jinu! Jinu!

00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:18.859
Unfortunately, the Saja Boys have to run.
Thank you, everyone.

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:32.164
The Internet loves this,
and the Internet is never wrong!

00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:34.249
Rujinu! That's genius.

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.543
Zoeystery.
Where did they come up with that?

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.046
Miro-mabby?

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:41.006
Aw, you're so cute together!

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.136
"Time to put you in your place
'Cause you're rotten within!"

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.971
"When your patterns start to show"

00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:50.808
"It makes the hatred wanna grow
Out of my…"

00:46:56.522 --> 00:47:02.361
When your patterns start to show
I see a pain that lies below

00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:07.741
Calm down.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:09.034
I'm not gonna meet him.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.579
Rumi?

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.873
Uh-- You gotta get outta here. Come on.

00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:16.959
-I can hear you in there.
-Uh, yeah.

00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:19.294
Uh, give me a minute.

00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:27.636
Hm?

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:30.973
Uh… what are you doing?

00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:33.100
Um, nothing. Just, uh…

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.060
Did you wanna come in?

00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:37.354
I mean, if you want me to come in,
I can come in.

00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:41.483
I heard you singing.

00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:42.734
You sound good.

00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:46.280
Yeah, who would've thought?
Those tonics actually work.

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:50.158
So, why are you changing our lyrics?

00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:52.452
Oh, I just…

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:56.623
Do you really think
this is the right song to beat Gwi-Ma?

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.875
It's so hateful.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:00.752
Yeah, because we hate him,
and we hate demons.

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:01.879
No, I know.

00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:03.839
Okay, what is up with you?

00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:06.550
I could swear, the other day,
you were talking to a demon.

00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:09.344
-I…
-And "Woo, Jinu"? What was that about?

00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:12.014
Playing him up to psych him out.
Get in his head.

00:48:12.097 --> 00:48:13.765
I'm pretty good at reading people.

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:15.601
Actually, I'm kind of an expert at it,

00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:19.313
and I just can't shake this feeling
that you're keeping something from me.

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:23.483
Mira, I'm not keeping anything from you.

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.693
I promise.

00:48:25.944 --> 00:48:28.530
Sorry. I sound nuts.

00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:31.074
I guess these demons
are just getting to me.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:35.078
I can't wait
until every one of them is destroyed

00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:37.873
and sent back
to suffer with Gwi-Ma for eternity.

00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:39.333
Right, Rumi?

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:43.420
Yeah. Eternal suffering. Sounds fun.

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:53.221
Hey, everybody.

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:56.183
Our fan club just hit 50 million fans.

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:58.560
We have to give a shout-out to Huntrix.

00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:00.771
We couldn't have done it
without their support.

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:03.148
And to our fans, thank you.

00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:06.068
We really feed off your energy.

00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:06.985
In other news,

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:11.114
the amount of missing person reports
have tripled in the last 24 hours.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:15.327
We're so excited to show you what's next.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.341
She wants to meet, and she's late?

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:34.471
You made me come all the way
out here so you could jump-scare me?

00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:36.348
Follow me.

00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:39.768
Well, I'm glad
you're finally ready to talk.

00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:42.479
Although, you could've picked
somewhere nicer for a date.

00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:45.357
Date? No! Ew! What are you talking about?

00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:49.486
That doesn't mean-- You're so old.

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:51.655
This is strictly a business meeting.

00:49:51.738 --> 00:49:53.407
Okay, loud and clear.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.660
What if I told you
there's another way to get your freedom?

00:49:56.743 --> 00:49:57.619
Go on.

00:49:57.703 --> 00:49:59.538
Help us win the Idol Awards.

00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:03.458
Because when we win,
the Honmoon will be sealed.

00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:06.461
And that will guarantee your freedom.

00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.547
Gwi-Ma will be permanently cut off,

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:11.717
and all the demons
will be gone from this world.

00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:14.970
I will finally be free of these patterns.

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:17.806
No more hiding. No more secrets.

00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:21.101
You can be on this side
when the Honmoon is sealed.

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.644
Away from the demon world,

00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:23.895
away from Gwi-Ma.

00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:26.898
You can be free from those voices forever.

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:30.652
What makes you think
the Honmoon can save a guy like me?

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:33.655
A guy who tried to help his family?
You made a mistake, Jinu.

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:35.240
It's not that simple.

00:50:35.323 --> 00:50:37.159
But I am a mistake.

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.746
Have been since the moment I was born.

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:42.748
So, I have to believe.

00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:48.420
Because if there's no hope for you,
what hope is there for me?

00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:52.090
Bracelet? For your beautiful girlfriend?

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.926
-Oh, no. We're not-- She's not my type.
-Oh, no. Ugh. What?

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:56.428
Excuse me? I'm everyone's type.

00:50:56.511 --> 00:50:58.930
-You can't even show up on time.
-You from the 1900s?

00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:00.682
-I see why you're single.
-What?

00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:02.392
See? We'd never work.

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:05.437
Here, free one.
Go find yourself a better boy.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.147
This one's hopeless.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.025
Well, there's your answer.

00:51:10.108 --> 00:51:11.193
Hopeless.

00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:17.032
That's the funny thing about hope.
Nobody else gets to decide if you feel it.

00:51:17.115 --> 00:51:18.867
That choice belongs to you.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.371
Fine.

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:24.623
Your loss.

00:51:31.296 --> 00:51:34.549
-I was just trying to get the bracelet.
-Oh. Yeah. The bracelet.

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:41.681
For what it's worth,
I don't think you're a mistake.

00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:49.940
-Okay, bye.
-Yeah, uh, bye. Uh--

00:51:53.401 --> 00:51:56.154
-I need to see "Golden" live.
-The Idol Awards are tomorrow.

00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:58.448
Thank goodness I didn't hold my breath,

00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.117
'cause I'd be dead by now.

00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:05.914
Time to put you in your place
'Cause you're rotten within!

00:52:05.997 --> 00:52:07.666
When your patterns start to show

00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:10.127
It makes the hatred
Wanna grow out of my…

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.920
What's going on?

00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:13.171
Why are we stopping?

00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:17.342
These lyrics are throwing me off.
I don't think they're right just yet.

00:52:17.425 --> 00:52:19.219
Seriously? Now?

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.679
No, it's fine.

00:52:20.762 --> 00:52:22.764
It's the second verse, right?
Uh, how about…

00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:26.351
"When the patterns start to show,
the world will know that you're depraved"?

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:27.978
Hm.

00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:30.689
Um, "My sword will happily
Show you to your grave."

00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:33.608
-"You'll be pummeled till no remains."
-No, Zoey, it's just--

00:52:33.692 --> 00:52:35.110
It's the whole song.

00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:36.236
Oh, okay, great.

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:40.198
Well, then, I might as well
just tear these all up.

00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:44.327
Rumi, we don't have time
to change the lyrics even if we wanted to.

00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:46.121
The Idol Awards are tomorrow.

00:52:46.204 --> 00:52:49.207
Well, I don't think I can sing this song.

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:54.337
Hey, girls, just wanted to bring
some last-minute pick-me-ups.

00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:57.132
I know things
have been really stressful lately,

00:52:57.215 --> 00:53:00.260
and you've been working so hard
on the Idol routine.

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:02.679
For what it's worth, I am proud of you,

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:08.101
and I just want you to know
I'm here for literally anything you need.

00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:13.440
You're my soda pop!
My little soda pop!

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:16.359
Join the Pride. We need you.

00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.909
Seriously, what is your problem?

00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:25.535
I told you, the song, it's--

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:29.080
I'm not talking about the song,
I'm talking about you!

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:31.541
Why are you questioning
everything we stand for

00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.877
when we're so close
to sealing the Honmoon?

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.546
-What are you not telling us, Rumi?
-I-- I--

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.131
What are you hiding from us?

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:40.967
Not everything
is about your insecurities, Mira!

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.471
Mira, I didn't mean…

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:47.349
Would you two stop fighting each other
and look?

00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:51.811
-The tear.
-It's huge.

00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:58.026
If you're with us, prove it.

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:03.198
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
You'll break down like, "What?"

00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:06.576
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
And it ain't gonna stop!

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.620
Jung-shin-eul-noh-koh
Null-jib-balb-goh!

00:54:08.703 --> 00:54:10.038
Kal-eul-seh-gyuh-nuah!

00:54:10.121 --> 00:54:13.833
You'll be begging and crying
All of you dying, never miss my shot!

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.962
I don't think you're ready
For the takedown!

00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:20.507
A demon with no feelings
Don't deserve to live!

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.092
It's so obvious

00:54:22.175 --> 00:54:23.760
I'mma gear up!

00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:27.681
Rumi!

00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:32.894
You can try, but you can't hide!

00:54:32.978 --> 00:54:34.896
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.356
And it ain't gonna stop!

00:54:40.485 --> 00:54:41.444
The passengers!

00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:43.488
Join The Pride, we need you!

00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:47.158
Join the Pride, we need you!
Join the Pride, we need you!

00:54:54.749 --> 00:54:57.794
Whatever you think about the song,
it doesn't matter now.

00:54:58.378 --> 00:55:00.088
Everything is at stake,

00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:03.675
and we just need
to get through this together.

00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:07.512
You know I'm always on your side,

00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:10.015
but it's really hard
to understand this time.

00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:13.768
We can't win this
without your voice, Rumi.

00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:22.986
Trust me, I'm gonna make sure we win.

00:55:34.372 --> 00:55:38.585
Okay, so I've been meaning to ask,
why does the bird wear a tiny hat?

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:41.671
I made it for the tiger,
but the bird keeps taking it.

00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:50.930
So, about tomorrow,
have you thought about my proposal?

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:53.975
Look, I want to believe
in your crazy plan,

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:57.145
but I don't think I'm the one to help you.

00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:59.981
Actually, you already have.

00:56:01.399 --> 00:56:05.945
I spent my whole life keeping this secret,
this shame of what I am,

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.781
and the more I hid this shame,

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.908
the more it grew and grew

00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:13.661
until it started to destroy the one thing
that gave me a purpose,

00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:15.038
my voice.

00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:17.874
But since I've met you,

00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:20.335
and the more I talk to you,

00:56:20.418 --> 00:56:25.298
I don't understand it,
but somehow, my voice has healed.

00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:30.929
I tried to hide, but something broke

00:56:31.513 --> 00:56:34.015
I tried to sing
Couldn't hit the notes

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:37.268
The words kept catching in my throat

00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:41.106
I tried to smile
I was suffocating though

00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:44.692
But here with you
I can finally breathe

00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:46.444
You say you're no good

00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:48.238
But you're good for me

00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:50.115
I've been hoping to change

00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:51.991
Now I know we can change

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:56.538
But I won't if you're not by my side

00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.915
Why does it feel right

00:56:58.998 --> 00:57:00.667
Every time I let you in?

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.335
Why does it feel like

00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.337
I can tell you anything?

00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.966
All the secrets
That keep me in chains and

00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:10.927
All the damage
That might make me dangerous

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.595
You got a dark side

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:14.305
Guess you're not the only one

00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:15.974
What if we both tried

00:57:16.057 --> 00:57:18.226
Fighting what we're running from?

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:21.271
We can't fix it if we never face it

00:57:21.354 --> 00:57:24.482
What if we find a way to escape it?

00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:31.322
We could be free, free!

00:57:31.906 --> 00:57:35.201
We can't fix it if we never face it

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:38.329
Let the past be the past
Till it's weightless

00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:42.834
Oh, time goes by
And I lose perspective

00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:45.795
Yeah, hope only hurts
So I just forget it

00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:49.048
You're breaking through the dark in me
When I thought nobody could

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:52.510
You're waking up all these parts of me
I thought were buried for good

00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:55.889
Between imposter and this monster
I been lost inside my head

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:59.392
Ain't no choice when all these voices
Keep me pointing towards no end!

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.352
It's just easy when I'm with you

00:58:01.436 --> 00:58:03.062
No one sees me the way you do

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.732
I don't trust it, but I want to
I keep coming back to

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:09.152
Why does it feel right
Every time I let you in?

00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:10.945
Why does it feel like

00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:13.114
I can tell you anything?

00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:15.909
We can't fix it if we never face it

00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.537
What if we find a way to escape it?

00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:26.544
We could be free, free!

00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:29.923
We can't fix it if we never face it

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:33.176
Let the past be the past
Till it's weightless!

00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:34.886
Whoa!

00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:38.181
So take my hand

00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:41.100
It's open!

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:47.148
Free! Free!

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:54.864
What if we heal what's broken?

00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:59.827
Free! Free!

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:04.457
I tried to hide But something broke

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.961
I couldn't sing
But you give me hope

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:11.297
We can't fix it if we never face it

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.174
Let the past be the past

00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:14.884
Till it's weightless

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.020
I… I don't hear his voice.

00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:30.483
I'll make sure
the Saja Boys lose tomorrow.

00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:32.694
Then we'll both win.

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.321
Rumi, wait. I…

00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:41.828
I… I can't wait
to see you on that stage tomorrow.

00:59:49.711 --> 00:59:51.713
Ow.

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:03.933
What's with the long faces?
Everything's going to plan.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.185
Look at all these souls, huh?

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.187
Turn around.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.941
That's funny.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:15.945
I thought for a moment
you actually believed you could be free.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.367
Yeah, that's funny.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.911
Because if you really believed her,

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:26.956
if you really thought
you could escape what you are,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.041
what you did…

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.836
…you would have told her the truth.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.089
You betrayed your own family.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.175
You left them behind.

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:39.093
You killed your family.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.847
Don't forget about our deal, Jinu,

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.475
because I can turn those voices up.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:48.770
They're going to die.

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:53.608
Or they can be gone.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:56.152
Don't think you can escape

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.488
what you are.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.832
Every time.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.127
Maybe they'll understand.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.295
No, Rumi.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:18.049
Nothing can change
until your patterns are gone.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.222
Everything's set.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:26.516
Well, almost everything.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.687
Look, the last few weeks have been hard.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.148
And I admit, I haven't been at my best.

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.526
But I know we can win tomorrow.

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.569
We just have to sing the right song.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.737
And "Takedown" isn't--

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:40.905
It's okay, Rumi.

01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:41.906
We agree.

01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:44.867
It's not the song
that's gonna connect all our fans.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.787
It can't even connect us.

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:54.794
I know our faults
and fears must never be seen,

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.922
but, look, I'm kind of a difficult person.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.842
Overly blunt,
short-fused, highly aggressive.

01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:03.845
My whole life,
those things were a liability.

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:08.766
But somehow, with you guys, they're okay.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.560
I feel the same way.

01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:12.770
Before I joined Huntrix,

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:15.857
I felt like my thoughts
and my lyrics and all my notebooks

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.943
were just useless and weird.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.113
But with the two of you,
they mean something.

01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:23.573
I mean something.

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.534
I'm afraid of losing you guys too.

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.911
And that's why we have to finish this.

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.748
All these fears, it's the demons talking.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.125
But tomorrow, we can win this war.

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:37.920
And when the Honmoon is sealed,
we will be free of these demons.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.672
Free of these fears forever.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.842
And then we can take a hiatus.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.677
Maybe go to the bathhouse?

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.556
-What? I'll fight for a spa day with you.
-The women's bathhouse, not the men's?

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.641
Let's do it!
Wait, what song are we singing?

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:51.934
-"Golden."
-"Takedown"!

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.811
I mean "Golden." Definitely "Golden."

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.772
It's a song about the best of us.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.482
Rumi, your voice good to go?

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:58.858
Never been stronger.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:02:59.817
Happy fans?

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:02.653
Happy Honmoon!

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:03.946
Yeah!

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.370
Two bands, one award.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.790
Every snowflake is special.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:18.544
But one snowflake is probably the best.
Who will be the top of the mountain?

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.882
Fans from around the universe will decide.

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:27.887
Finally, the moment
you've been waiting for.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:33.184
Here are the five-year reigning champs
of the International Idol Awards, Huntrix!

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:35.228
We love Huntrix!

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:40.983
Versus the heart-stealing newcomers,
the Saja Boys!

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:42.485
We love you!

01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:44.529
Who will win?

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:53.996
Ugh. Look at that smug face.
I'm gonna freaking smash it.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.414
Save it for the stage.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:04:00.795
Please welcome to the stage,
the Saja Boys!

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:03.840
Saja Boys!

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.761
What's going on?

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.847
I hate Abs!

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.307
-Girls, the Saja Boys are fighting.
-What?

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:14.642
That means you're on now!

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.811
Okay. This is it. For the fans.

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:17.770
For the world.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.146
For us.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:24.944
Yes! We win this, and then we celebrate
with Itaewon corn dogs!

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.445
Yay!

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.699
Uh…

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:33.327
Okay, uh, there's been
a slight change in schedule.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:37.874
Here to perform their hot new single,
"Golden," it's Huntrix!

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:47.925
I was a ghost

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.385
I was alone

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:53.514
Eo du wojin, ap gil sok e

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.103
Given the throne
I didn't know how to believe

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.480
I was the queen that I'm meant to be!

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.232
I lived two lives

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.109
Tried to play both sides

01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:08.988
But I couldn't find my own place!

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.032
Called a problem child

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:13.159
'Cause I got too wild

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:16.203
But now that's how I'm getting paid

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.622
Kkeut eop si on stage!

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.749
I'm done hiding

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.417
Now I'm shining

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.087
Like I'm born to be!

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.923
We dreaming hard

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.841
We came so far

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.261
Now I believe!

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:34.513
We're going up, up, up!

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.057
It's our moment!

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.100
You know together we're glowing!

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.061
Gonna be, gonna be golden…

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:41.687
She's killing it out there!

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.439
Let's go finish this.

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.149
Gonna be, gonna be golden!

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:47.193
-Bobby?
-You're on in 20 seconds!

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.780
Whoa, I'm done hiding

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.657
Now I'm shining

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.952
Like I'm born to be!

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.079
Oh, our time

01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:00.164
No fears, no lies

01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:03.417
That's who we're born to be!

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.460
You know

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:07.797
We're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be…

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.798
Bobby?

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:10.800
Yes! Rumi's crushing it!

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.719
You know that it's our time

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.638
No fears, no lies

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:19.934
That’s who we’re born to be!

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.359
Takedown, takedown, down, down, down

01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:31.404
-What?
-Why are they playing "Takedown"?

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.947
Something's wrong.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.073
-Rumi!
-Rumi!

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.493
"Takedown"? They put this back in?

01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:39.203
Is this a new song?

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:41.914
It's a takedown!

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.708
So sweet, so easy on the eyes

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.334
Way hideous on the inside

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.504
Whole life spreading lies
But you can't hide, baby, nice try!

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.381
About to switch up these vibes…

01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:51.632
Zoey?

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:52.550
Mira?

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:55.136
Time to kick you
Straight back into the night!

01:06:55.219 --> 01:06:57.638
'Cause I see your real face
It's ugly as sin…

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.931
What's going on?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.559
-Are they fighting?
-Why? No.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.020
Please! Stop!

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.397
Makes hatred wanna grow
Out of my veins

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.648
Rumi!

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.776
I don't think
You're ready for the takedown

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.572
Break you into pieces in a world of pain
'Cause you're all the same

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.240
Hang on, Rumi! We're coming!

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.616
Takedown!

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.118
A demon with no feelings

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.661
Don't deserve to live!

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.538
It's so obvious!

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:25.332
I'mma gear up and take you down!

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.834
We see what you are.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:29.920
-You're a demon. A mistake.
-A mistake.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:30.880
No!

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:34.091
You have been since the day you were born.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:37.053
No!

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.081
What?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.416
How are you here?

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.251
You were just on stage.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.045
That wasn't you? Oh.

01:08:11.128 --> 01:08:13.089
Oh, thank goodness.

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:17.218
No. No!

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.385
No. No.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:22.056
-How do you have patterns?
-These were supposed to be gone.

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:23.599
You were never supposed to see!

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:26.936
You were hiding this from us
this whole time?

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:30.689
No, I have a plan to erase them.
Jinu was supposed to-- I-- He was--

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.025
Jinu? You're working with him?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.320
No. No! No!
I was using him to fix all this!

01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:39.490
To fix me! So we could all do our duty!

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:40.950
We could all be strong.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:41.867
Be together.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.452
How could we be together

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:46.163
if we can't tell your lies
from your truths, Rumi?

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:50.000
I knew it.
I knew it was too good to be true.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:54.713
Mira, no! Didn't you see?
See the gold? We're so close!

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:59.468
No! Don't leave! Don't leave!

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:04.181
I can still…fix it!

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.360
Zoey, please.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.958
Jinu? Jinu! Where are you?

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.420
Jinu!

01:09:36.797 --> 01:09:38.799
Say you didn't do this.

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.386
How could you do this?

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:43.596
It was all a lie.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.932
It was real!
What we had was real. I know it was!

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:50.102
The things I said?
I just needed you to trust me. That's all.

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:54.273
No! No, I know your story.
You were a good person, and you still are.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.691
You just made a mistake.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:57.610
I left them!

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.570
That's right, I lied to you.

01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:04.158
I only made a deal with Gwi-Ma
to get myself out of that miserable life.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:07.411
I left my sister, my mother, alone

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:11.957
while I slept on silk sheets in the palace
with my belly full every night!

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.961
I left them. I left them.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.547
But that's not all you are.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.591
This is just your demon talking.

01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:22.968
-You have to fight it!
-That's not how it works!

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.511
Yes, it is!

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:26.680
Listen to yourself.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.015
Is it working?

01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:31.143
You're a demon, just like me.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:35.731
All we get to do
is live with our pain, our misery.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.568
That's all we deserve.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.266
The Honmoon! It's coming apart!

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.518
Due to the Huntrix
public breakup on stage,

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.688
today's International Idol Awards
have been canceled.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:18.440
Here are the winners
of the International Idol Awards.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.526
Artist of the Year, Saja Boys.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.528
You couldn't keep them together.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:25.489
You're all alone,
but you don't have to be.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.701
Best New Artist, Saja Boys.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.120
Song of the Year, "Soda Pop."

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:34.039
Worldwide Icon of the Year, Saja Boys.

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:36.166
Hey, everybody.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.169
You must all be so sad
about the Huntrix breakup.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.421
We are too.

01:11:40.504 --> 01:11:41.672
So to cheer everyone up,

01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:44.967
we're going to do
a special live performance tonight.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:47.261
Midnight, Namsan Tower.

01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:50.139
Don't miss it for the world.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.059
Gwi-Ma, he's coming.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.856
You thought you found a family?

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:00.649
You don't deserve one.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:02.067
You never have.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.362
What are we gonna do without Rumi?
Our songs are three-part harmonies.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.948
-How do we--
-There is no "we," Zoey.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.159
I don't get to have a family.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.872
You're too much. And not enough.

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:18.959
You'll never belong anywhere,
but I can give you a place to belong.

01:12:45.277 --> 01:12:46.487
Rumi?

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:50.657
I thought I could fix it all.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:52.826
Fix me.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:54.870
But I ran out of time.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.500
They saw.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.542
They know.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.669
There's no denying it now.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:05.798
This is what I am.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.466
Rumi, no.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:11.470
You knew I was a mistake
from the very start.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.352
Do what you should've done
a long time ago.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:23.774
Before I destroy what I swore to protect.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:26.318
Please.Do it!

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:32.449
I can't.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.159
When we lost your mother,

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.371
I swore to protect
all that was left of her,

01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:42.167
but I never thought
that that would be a child like you.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.381
Everything I was taught
told me you were wrong,

01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:49.341
but I made a promise.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:53.429
So I did my best
to accept you and help you.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.180
Accept me?

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.392
You told me to cover up, to hide.

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.769
Yes, until we can fix everything.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.271
And we still can.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.773
We can cover those up
and put everything right again.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.234
I'll tell Mira and Zoey
that it was all a lie,

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:09.987
an illusion by Gwi-Ma to break us apart.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.988
No.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.197
No more hiding.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.490
No more lies!

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.909
Rumi, we can still fix this.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.244
Don't you get it?

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:19.830
This is what I am.

01:14:19.913 --> 01:14:20.956
Look at me.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.584
Why can't you look at me?!

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:26.503
-Why couldn't you love me?!
-I do!

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.005
All of me!

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.841
This is why we have to hide it.

01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:33.385
Our faults and fears must never be seen.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.013
It's the only way to protect the Honmoon.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.230
If this is the Honmoon
I'm supposed to protect,

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.109
I'm glad to see it destroyed.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.996
Well done. Ready to forget it all?

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.501
Good. I'm ready to feast.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:17.262
Saja! Saja! Saja!

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:33.904
Saja!

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:35.531
Saja!

01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:55.384
I'll be your idol!

01:15:56.176 --> 01:15:58.595
Keeping you in check
Keeping you obsessed!

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.306
Play me on repeat kkeuteopsi
In your head!

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.809
Anytime it hurts, play another verse

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.144
I can be your sanctuary!

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.355
Know I'm the only one right now

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:11.441
I will love you more
When it all burns down!

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.694
More than power, more than gold

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.280
You gave me your heart
Now I'm here for your soul

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:21.076
I'm the only one
Who'll love your sins!

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:26.748
Feel the way my voice
Gets underneath your skin!

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.041
Listen cause I'm

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.876
Preaching to the choir

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.337
Can I get the mic a little higher?

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.840
Gimme your desire!

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.926
I can be the star you rely on

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.637
Nae hwanholae chwihae
You can't look away

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:44.016
Don't you know I'm here to save you?

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.809
Now we runnin' wild

01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:47.269
Yeah, I'm all you need

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:48.854
I'mma be your idol!

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:52.733
Unh! Bichinaneun fame
Gyesok oecheo I'm your idol!

01:16:52.816 --> 01:16:55.402
Thank you for the pain
'Cause it got me going viral!

01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:58.739
Oh yeah, naji anneun fever
Makin' you a believer

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:00.907
Nareul wihae neon jonjae haneun aideul

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:03.452
Living in your mind now

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:06.079
Too late 'cause you're mine now

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.206
I will make you free

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.335
When you’re all a part of me!

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.378
Preaching to the choir!

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.715
Can I get the mic a little higher?

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.508
Gimme your desire!

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:21.303
Once we set your world on fire!

01:17:21.386 --> 01:17:24.056
Nae hwanholae chwihae
You can't look away

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.309
No one is coming to save you

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:28.935
Now we running wild!

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.395
You're down on your knees

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:33.023
I'mma be your idol!

01:17:33.106 --> 01:17:37.402
Oh!

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:46.203
We are Hunters. Voices strong.

01:17:46.286 --> 01:17:48.997
Slaying demons with our song.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.292
Fix the world and make it right.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.712
When darkness finally meets the light.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.590
You come here like this?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.218
You think you can fix the world?

01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:03.303
You can't even fix yourself.

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:04.971
I can't.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:10.477
And now everyone finally sees you
for what you really are.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.853
They do.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.273
And the Honmoon is gone.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.483
It is.

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:18.902
So we can make a new one.

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:25.075
Nothing but the truth now

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:30.539
Nothing but the proof of what I am

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:33.250
The worst of what I came from

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.585
Patterns I'm ashamed of

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:39.131
Things that even I don't understand

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.383
I tried to fix it

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.593
I tried to fight it

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.929
My head was twisted

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:47.639
My heart divided

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.100
My lies all collided

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.602
I don't know why I didn't

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:56.189
Trust you to be on my side

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.487
I broke into a million pieces

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.156
And I can't go back

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.783
But now I'm seeing all the beauty

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.702
In the broken glass

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.287
The scars are part of me

01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:13.081
Darkness and harmony

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:15.292
My voice without the lies

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.586
This is what it sounds like!

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:22.382
Why did I cover up
The colors stuck inside my head?

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:26.678
I should've let the jagged edges
Meet the light instead

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.889
Show me what's underneath

01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:31.099
I'll find your harmony

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:33.435
The song we couldn't write

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:37.773
This is what it sounds like!

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:39.649
Stop this song!

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:43.028
We're shattering the silence

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.071
We're rising, defiant!

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.865
Shouting in the quiet

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.909
"You're not alone!"

01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:50.952
We listened to the demons

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.829
We let them get between us

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:56.374
But none of us are out here
On our own!

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.502
So we were cowards

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.587
So we were liars

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:02.672
So we're not heroes

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.174
We're still survivors!

01:20:04.257 --> 01:20:06.593
The dreamers, the fighters

01:20:06.676 --> 01:20:08.345
No lying, I'm tired

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:10.305
But dive in the fire

01:20:10.388 --> 01:20:13.767
And I'll be right here by your side

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.316
We broke into a million pieces

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:22.901
And we can't go back

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:24.361
But now we're seeing

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:27.239
All the beauty in the broken glass

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.865
The scars are part of me

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:31.034
Darkness and harmony

01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:32.828
My voice without the lies

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.913
This is what it sounds like!

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:38.959
Why did we cover up
The colors stuck inside our head?

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:41.253
Get up and let the jagged edges

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:42.921
Meet the light instead

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.923
Show me what's underneath

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:47.008
I'll find your harmony

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.510
Fearless and undefined

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:50.720
This is what it sounds like!

01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:11.408
Your voices cannot defeat me!

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:15.537
No!

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.372
Rumi!

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:43.565
Jinu! No!

01:21:43.648 --> 01:21:47.569
I'm sorry for everything.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:52.616
No. I wanted to set you free.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.493
You did.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:58.121
You gave me my soul back.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:04.169
And now…

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:07.547
I give it to you.

01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:30.612
Oh!

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:33.323
This is what it sounds like, hey!

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:35.992
Oh!

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:37.077
Hey!

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.747
This is what it sounds like, hey!

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:44.417
Oh! Hey!

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.711
You're just my type. Oh, well.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.922
This is what it sounds like, hey!

01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:52.050
No more abs!

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:56.972
This what it, this is what it
This is what it sounds like!

01:22:57.055 --> 01:23:00.850
We broke into a million pieces
And we can't go back

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:04.854
But now I'm seeing all the beauty
In the broken glass

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.606
The scars are part of me

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.483
Darkness and harmony

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:10.276
My voice without the lies

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.404
This is what it sounds like!

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:16.324
Why did we cover up
The colors stuck inside our head?

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:20.120
Get up and let the jagged edges
Meet the light instead!

01:23:20.203 --> 01:23:22.080
Show me what's underneath

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.999
I'll find your harmony

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.875
Fearless and undefined

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:27.877
This is what it sounds like!

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.629
My voice without the lies

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.631
This is what it sounds like!

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:33.633
Fearless and undefined

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:35.635
This is what it sounds like!

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.637
Truth after all this time

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.764
Our voices all combined!

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.516
When darkness meets the light

01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:46.229
This is what it sounds like!

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:01.202
We love you, Huntrix!

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:06.124
I love my girls.

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:27.395
Ah!

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:29.856
Wow. This feels amazing.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:32.484
We've been saying that for years.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:34.861
Right? See what you've been missing?

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:38.698
Oh, yeah. I wanna come here
every day of our three-month hiatus.

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:42.368
Rumi, I'm so happy you didn't, like, die.

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:44.913
Wow, Zoey, way to be super literal.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:46.122
But same.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.792
I just… You guys just mean so much to me,

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:51.628
and I don't really know
what I'd do with you.

01:24:51.711 --> 01:24:54.339
I mean, I love you guys so much.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:02.263
Couch. Couch. Couch.

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:05.058
Three months of couch.

01:25:07.393 --> 01:25:09.687
Aw, look at them. They're so cute.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.690
You know, I feel like
we got a nice little break.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.984
Yeah, I definitely feel recharged.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:19.280
Me too. I thought I wanted couch,
but I think couch can wait.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:20.907
Hi, everyone.

01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:22.742
Rumi! Mira!

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:26.371
-Oh my gosh, I love you guys so much!
-You guys are too sweet.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.540
-You're the best.
-No, you guys are the best.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:46.766
Takedown, takedown, takedown,
Down, down, down

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.227
-Huntrix girls to the world!
-Takedown

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.603
It's a takedown

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:53.898
So sweet, so easy on the eyes
But hideous on the inside

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.192
Whole life spreading lies
But you can't hide

01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:57.402
Baby, nice try

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.864
I'm 'bout ta switch up these vibes
I finally opened my eyes

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.867
It's time to kick you
Straight back into the night

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.162
'Cause I see your real face
And it's ugly as sin

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:10.623
Time to put you in your place
'Cause you're rotten within

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.375
When your patterns start to show

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:16.254
It's makes the hatred wanna grow
Out of my veins

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:19.716
I don't think you're ready
For the takedown

01:26:19.799 --> 01:26:22.760
Break you into pieces
In a world of pain

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.387
'Cause you're all the same

01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:26.431
Yeah, it's the takedown

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:29.642
A demon with no feelings
Don't deserve to live

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:31.728
It's so obvious

01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:34.230
I'mma gear up and take you down

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.149
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:39.569
-It's a takedown
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:26:39.652 --> 01:26:41.070
I'mma take you down

01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:42.947
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.324
It's a takedown

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:46.826
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da
-Take it down

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.371
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
You'll break down like, "What?"

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:53.708
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
And it ain't gonna stop

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:55.835
Jung-shin-eul-noh-koh
Null-jib-balb-goh!

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:57.086
Kal-eul-seh-gyuh-nuah

01:26:57.170 --> 01:27:00.423
You'll be begging and crying
All of you dying, never miss my shot

01:27:00.506 --> 01:27:02.175
When your patterns start to show

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:06.012
It makes the hatred wanna grow
Out of my veins

01:27:06.095 --> 01:27:09.432
I don't think you're ready
For the takedown

01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:12.393
Dangdang ha geh uh-doom
Ap-eh da-ga-su

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.062
Da mu-nuh-deuh-ryuh

01:27:14.145 --> 01:27:16.147
Yeah, it's the takedown

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.858
A demon with no feelings
Don't deserve to live

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.319
It's so obvious

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:24.030
I'mma gear up and take you down

01:27:24.113 --> 01:27:26.532
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da
-It's a takedown

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.452
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:30.954
I'mma take it down

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:33.039
Watch me do it, yeah

01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:34.207
Takedown

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.793
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:41.881
Oh, you're the master of illusion

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:43.800
Nah-rul-sok-ee-ryuh-ha-ji-ma

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:48.221
Look at all the masses
That you're fooling

01:27:48.304 --> 01:27:51.474
But they'll turn on you soon, so how

01:27:51.557 --> 01:27:54.936
How can you sleep
Or live with yourself?

01:27:55.019 --> 01:27:58.481
A broken soul
Trapped in the nastiest shell

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:00.024
Yong-hon-ub-neun

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.776
Nee mok-soom-eul

01:28:01.859 --> 01:28:07.073
Geun-uh-roh and watch you die!

01:28:07.156 --> 01:28:09.284
You can try, but you can't hide

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:12.912
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
You'll break down like, "What?"

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:15.748
It's a takedown, I'mma take you out
It ain't gonna stop

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:19.127
I'mma cut you open, lose control
Then rip out your heart

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:21.504
You'll be begging and crying
All of you dying

01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:26.301
-I'mma gear up and take you down!
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:29.679
-Takedown! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:28:29.762 --> 01:28:32.515
-Takedown!
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:36.477
-Takedown! Watch me do it, yeah
-Oh, oh, da-da-da-da

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:38.021
Take it down!
