Bring them over
a round of drinks.

Very good, sir. And who
shall I say they are from?

53
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.882
You can say they are from me.

54
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:43.945
From the gentleman.

55
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.322

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.954
Do you know him?

Find out who he is.

58
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.835
Yes, sir.

59
00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.592
Agnieszka, I would give
anything to hear you sing tonight.

60
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.510
(Sighs) But I know you won't.

61
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.595
(Laughs)

62
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.682
You embarrass me.

63
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.360
What's he doing?

64
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.906
Stay here.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.328
How are you doing?

66
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.373
You'd leave a woman alone
at the table in a place like this?

67
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.543
Sweetheart, you're
the picture of loneliness.

68
00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.299
Mmm, what a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

69
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.843
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.053

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.779
I'll tell you what
I mean by cooperative.

88
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.558
Two days after the law is passed

89
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.268
that all Jews have
to wear the star,

90
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.391
the Jewish tailors are
turning them out by the gross

91
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.605
in a variety of
fabrics at three zloty each.

92
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.524
Tell me about your cellar wines.

93
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:48.361
I have an excellent German
Riesling. 1937. Mmm, French.

94
00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.072
A Bordeaux. Chateau
latour, '28, '29? No, I'm sorry.

95
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.117
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

96
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.661
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

97
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.580
A margaux, '29?
No, no, we don't have that.

98
00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.249
Burgundy then? A
romanée-Conti, '37? Yes.

99
00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.252
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that."

100
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.047
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

101
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.275
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

102
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.927
But this storm is different. This is
not the romans. This storm is the ss.

103
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:16.806
Wem gott will
rechte gunst erweisen

104
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.310
den schickt er in die weite welt

105

Yes, sir.

113
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.256
Who is that man?

114
00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.094
That's Oskar schindler!

115
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.637
Faleri

122
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.628
(Soldiers laughing)

123
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.518
(Singing continues)

124
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.566
Man on loudspeaker:
An alle juden!

125
00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:54.028
Ab sofort ist es Allen
juden untersagt...

126
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.698
Fleisch auf koschere art
zuzubereiten.

127
00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.994
Meldung an alle juden.
Ab sofort...

128
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.501
The judenrat the Jewish
council comprised of 24 elected

129
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:13.923
Jews personally responsible for carrying out
the order of the regime in krakow, such as

130
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:20.263
drawing up lists for work details, food
and housing. A place to lodge complaints.

131
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.432
Rabbi...

132
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.742
Private property
cannot be confiscated.

133
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.035
How long are the schools
going to be closed?

134
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.144
I do not know.

135
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.413
"Article 47, pillage
is formally prohibited."

136
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.813
You don't know anything!

137
00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.916
I am familiar with the hague
convention. Religious...

138
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.736
They come into our house and
tell us we don't live there anymore.

139
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.822
It now belongs to
a certain ss officer.

140
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.450
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

141
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.453
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

142
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.456
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

143
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.459
I mean, what if I
just took this thing off?

144
00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.461
What are they
going to do about it?

145
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.046
They will shoot you.

146
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.090
Why don't you stop this
silly talk? Itzhak stern!

147
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.761
I'm looking for Itzhak stern.

148
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.224
Are you Itzhak stern or not?

149
00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.560
I am. Where can we talk?

150
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.157
There's a company you did
the books for on lipowa street.

151
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.202
Made what? Pots and pans?

152
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.996
By law, I have to
tell you, sir, I'm a Jew.

153
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:31.084
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

154
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:35.838
A good company, you think?

155
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.340
Modestly successful.

156
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.343
I know nothing about
enamelware. Do you?

157
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.220
I was just the accountant.

158
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.313
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

159
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.825
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

160
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.977
You could make other things,
couldn't you?

161
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:54.023
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

162
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.070
Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

163
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.989
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

164
00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:04.117
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

165
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.078
Like what? (Sighs)

166
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.224
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

167
00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.184
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

168
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.712
Well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

169
00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.632
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

170
00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.467
You don't have any money?

171
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.430
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

172
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.892
Jews, yeah. Investors.

173
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.913
You must have contacts in
the Jewish business community,

174
00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:33.938
working here.

175
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.607
What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

176
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.085
That's why this
one's in receivership.

177
00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.402
But they wouldn't own it.

178
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.530
I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product, pots and pans.

179
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.198
Pots and pans.

180
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.658
Something they can use.

181
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.886
Something they can
feel in their hands.

182
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.912
They can trade it
on the black market,

183
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.998
do whatever they want.
Everybody's happy.

184
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.919
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

185
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.634
Let me understand. They'd put up

186
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.054
all the money,
I'd do all the work.

187
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.265
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

188
00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.018
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

189
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.228
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

190
00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:17.148
That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

191
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.276
The presentation.

192
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.882
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

193
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:47.345
(Exhales) Well,
they should be, Itzhak stern.

194
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.140
Tell them they should be.

195
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.485
Man on loudspeaker:
Achtung! Achtung!

196
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.533
An alle juden.
Ab sofort ist es verboten...

197
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:13.830
Priest reciting: Vere dignum
etjustum est, aequum et salutare,

198
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:17.959
nos tibi semper et
unique gratias agere:

199
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:22.088
Domine sancte, pater
omnipotens, aeterne deus...

200
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.842
I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45-to-1.

201
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.802
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

202
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.804
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

203
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.556
Wicks, for lamps.

204
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.391
You have a truckload of wicks?

205
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.768
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?

206
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.353
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

207
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.022
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, persian.

208
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.194
Psst.

209
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.320
What?

210
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.281
You don't recognize this?
It's shoe Polish.

211
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.657
In metal containers?

212
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.075
You asked for shoe Polish.

213
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.178
In metal containers. This
is glass. In metal containers.

214
00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.242
It's not what I asked for.

215
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.456
What's the difference?
What's the difference?

216
00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.724
What's the difference?
Others: Shh!

217
00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.375
My client sold it to his client,

218
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.127
who sold it to the German army.

219
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.379
Only by the time it
got there, because

220
00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.715
of the freezing cold,
it broke. All 10,000 units.

221
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.134
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

222
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:09.820
This is not his problem.
This is not your problem?

223
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.053
This is not my problem.

224
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.472
All right.

225
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.559
The German army wants to
find out where it came from.

226
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.704
I am going to make
sure they find out.

227
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:19.979
Now it's your problem.

228
00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.398
You, be quiet! (Chuckles)

229
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.359
Metal containers.

230
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:27.987
Hello.

231
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.325
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

232
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.203
Nice shirt.

233
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.915
Do you know where I can
find a nice shirt like that?

234
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.127
Priest: Iaudare,
benedicere et predicare.

235
00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.257
Like this?

236
00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.260
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

237
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.263
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

238
00:16:56.516 --> 00:17:00.019
Priest: Jesum christum
dominum nostrum...

239
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.022
Do you have any idea how
much a shirt like this costs?

240
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:04.649
Nice things cost money.

241
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:08.778
Priest: Adorant
dominationes, tremunt potestates.

242
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:13.991
Coeli coelorumque
virtutes ac beata seraphim

243
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.246
socia exultatione
concelebrant...

244
00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.289
How many?

245
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.961
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

246
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.712
This won't be a problem.

247
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.548
From time to time.

248
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.300
Man on loudspeaker:
Achtung! Achtung!

249
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:37.431
March 20,1941 deadline
for entering the ghetto

250
00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:41.227
edict 44/91 establishes a closed Jewish
district south of the vistula river. Residency

251
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.729
in the walled ghetto
is compulsory.

252
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.959
All Jews from krakow and surrounding areas
are forced from their homes and required

253
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.735
to crowd into an area
of only sixteen square blocks.

254
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.451
(Children crying)

255
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.512
Officer 1: Name? Adresse?
Officer 2: Formular ausfl'illen!

256
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:19.223
Officer 1: Weiter, weiter!
Officer 2: Nicht drangeln!

257
00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.976
Kommen sie hierher!
Stellen sie sich doch an!

258
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.776
(Silverware clattering)

259
00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.067
Man on loudspeaker:
Achtung, achtung!

260
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.486
Alle juden sind verpflichtet...

261
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.781
Im abgesonderten
ju'dischen bezirk zu wohnen.

262
00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.659
Nichteinhaltung der meldepflicht
bei der einwohnerbehorde...

263
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.871
Versto'bt gegen das edikt 44/91
und fu'hrt zuranzeige...

264
00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.956
Beim militargericht.

265
00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.170
This is obviously the right
place. How are you doing?

266
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:33.255
(Indistinct shouting)

267
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:39.512
Goodbye, Jews! Goodbye, Jews!

268
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.722
Goodbye, Jews!

269
00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.557
Goodbye, Jews!

270
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:50.064
Girl: Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

271
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.025
Goodbye, Jews!

272
00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.614
This iz the vechteka, moyshe.
Ojciec.

273
00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.741
Nyne, this kan neash zyane.

274
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.585
(Sighs)

275
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.480
(Baby crying) (Woman
singing lullaby in Polish)

276
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.964
Oh, my god.

277
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.844
Oy, god. Oh, my god.

278
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.935
Oh, my god.

279
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.069
It could not be better.

280
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.029
It could be worse.

281
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.656
How? Tell me.

282
00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.201
(Shouting) How on earth
could it possibly be worse?

283
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.619
(Slams down suitcase)

284
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.663
Man: Dzien dobry.

285
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:50.916
Dzien dobry. Dzien dobry.

286
00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.669
Dzien dobry. Dzien dobry.

287
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:54.962
Dzien dobry.

288
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.047
(Speaking German)

289
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:00.926
Hey, goldberg. Poldek.

290
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.345
What's this?

291
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.765
The judenrat has
its own police now.

292
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:06.932
You don't say.

293
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.100
Ordnungsdienst.

294
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.437
I'm a policeman now, could
you believe it? It's hard to believe.

295
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.105
No, it's not hard to believe.

296
00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.608
It's a good racket, poldek.
The only racket here.

297
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.778
Look, maybe I could put in a
good word for you with my superiors.

298
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.029
Your superiors?

299
00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.823
Come on, they are not as bad
as everyone says.

300
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.910
Well, they're worse
than everyone says,

301
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:28.370
but it's a lot of money.
A lot of money.

302
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.415
Give me my housing assignment.

303
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.043
Come on.

304
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:35.669
You look funny in
that hat, goldberg.

305
00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:37.588
(Laughs)

306
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.216
You look like a clown, you know.

307
00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:49.183
Stern: He's a very important man.
Just give him two minutes of your time.

308
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:52.686
Since when did time cost
money? Just sit down and listen.

309
00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:55.397
Please. Sir?

310
00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.237
For each 1,000 you invest,
I will repay you with...

311
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.404
Two hundred.

312
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.673
Two hundred kilos of
enamelware a month,

313
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.383
to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

314
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.911
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

315
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.746
Not good enough.

316
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.206
It's not good enough.

317
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.416
Not good enough?

318
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.587
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough."

319
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.423
A couple of months ago
you'd be right. Not anymore.

320
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.884
Money's still money.

321
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:30.057
No, it is not.
That's why we're here.

322
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.393
Trade goods,
that's the only currency

323
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:34.353
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

324
00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.814
Things have changed, my friend.

325
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:41.861
Did I call this meeting?

326
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.737
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

327
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.656
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

328
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:49.785
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

329
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:54.832
(Laughing) Forget
the whole thing. Get out.

330
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:03.090
How do we know
that you will do what you say?

331
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.217
Because I said I would.

332
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.678
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

333
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.930
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

334
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:13.017
Mielismy racje.

335
00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:31.243
Piec, szesc, siedem,

336
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.915
osiem, dziewiec.

337
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.295
(Machinery buzzes)

338
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:46.967
(Schindler clapping)

339
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:53.015
The standard ss rate for Jewish
skilled laborers is seven marks a day,

340
00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.100
five for unskilled and women.

341
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:58.938
This is what you pay
the reich economic office.

342
00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:01.315
The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

343
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:05.986
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.

344
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.404
Are you listening?

345
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:08.906
What was that about the ss?

346
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.866
The rate? The what?

347
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.952
The Jewish worker's salary.
You pay it

348
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:14.662
directly to the ss,
not to the worker.

349
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:16.497
He gets nothing. But it's less.

350
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.891
It's less than what
I would pay a pole.

351
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:19.124
It's less.

352
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:23.963
That's the point I'm trying
to make. Poles cost more.

353
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:25.839
(Sniffs)

354
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.509
Why should I hire Poles?

355
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.763
An enamelware factory
over at lipowa street.

356
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.308
It's owned by a German.

357
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:40.396
But it's outside the ghetto, so
you can barter for extra goods,

358
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.189
for eggs,
I don't know what you need,

359
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.042
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

360
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:47.528
Also, he's asking for
10 healthy women for the...

361
00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:48.696
I am healthy.

362
00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:49.822
(Crowd laughing)

363
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.323
Bring your sister, okay?

364
00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:53.492
(Shouting orders
in German and Polish)

365
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:57.955
Chodz.

366
00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.302
You need to convince
them you have a trade,

367
00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:02.001
something valuable
to the war effort.

368
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:03.244
Like what? What if you don't?

369
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.461
I'm a musician.

370
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.088
Your name goes on a list.

371
00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:07.756
And they put you on trucks...

372
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.842
No, no, that's not true.
You're a musician?

373
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:11.093
Yeah.

374
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.487
I'd find a good
hiding place if I were you.

375
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.471
I'm not going to
hide like some animal.

376
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:16.598
There are places to hide.

377
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.434
(Whistle blowing)

378
00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:23.856
Der nachste!

379
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.275
I'm a graduate of
the university of lviv.

380
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:30.362
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in roznow.

381
00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:31.780
Man: Blauschein.

382
00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.661
I'm gonna get
the necessary papers

383
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.538
because this card
is no good anymore.

384
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:42.416
You can stay in this line all
day, you'll still get one of these.

385
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:46.253
They are no good. You'll
have to leave the line now,

386
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:48.505
then you'll get
a blue card, a blauschein,

387
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.841
to say that you are
an essential worker.

388
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.844
I'll get these papers
for you at pankiewicz.

389
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.637
Pharmacist. Just there, look.

390
00:25:56.764 --> 00:25:57.931
Guess who is here?

391
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.809
Goldberg: Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, poldek?

392
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:02.269
Enjoying the lines?

393
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.729
Need some shoe Polish?

394
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:05.856
In a metal container maybe?
(Goldberg laughs)

395
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:10.903
Not essential? I think you
misunderstand the meaning of the word.

396
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.157
No blauschein, sir. Stand
over there. Move. Next!

397
00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:19.495
What do you mean,
"not essential"?

398
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.625
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

399
00:26:30.047 --> 00:26:32.508
He's a metal polisher.

400
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.183
It was not right?

401
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.660
It's very good.
He's 53 years old.

402
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:44.103
It's too new.

403
00:26:44.228 --> 00:26:45.687
Mmm. Thank you.

404
00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:55.781
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.

405
00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:57.950
How many times have I told you?

406
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:01.495
Your work certificate you
keep in your pocket at all times.

407
00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:05.040
And you leave yours in your
drawer. How many times I've told you?

408
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.585
I'm a metal polisher.

409
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:23.892
Take the round sheet of tin,
dip it in soap emulsion,

410
00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:28.647
then place it
centrally in the press.

411
00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:48.041
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

412
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.294
Soup pot.

413
00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:53.922
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

414
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:01.763
Sir, I have 10 work permits here

415
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.516
for the deutsche
emailwarenfabrik

416
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.102
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

417
00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:11.773
Foreman: If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

418
00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:16.486
But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

419
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:20.073
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

420
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:26.955
Roll the metal under the press,

421
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.499
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers

422
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:31.418
to become part of the teapot.

423
00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:35.756
Occupation?

424
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.549
I'm a writer. I play the flute.

425
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.178
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

426
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:43.222
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

427
00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:45.349
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

428
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:49.811
He's highly skilled. Give him your
card. Moses, give him your card.

429
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:56.902
Foreman: Now, dip the basin
with the tongs into the enamel solution.

430
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:03.825
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

431
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.997
And whatever he
asks you, allow me

432
00:29:09.122 --> 00:29:10.958
just to represent
you and speak for you.

433
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.501
Don't say a word.

434
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:16.338
Schindler: Filing, billing, keeping
track of my appointments, shorthand.

435
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:18.465
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?

436
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.592
Uh, ahnght

437
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.135
please.

438
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.728
(Typing slowly)

439
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.650
(Typing slowly)

440
00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:39.903
(Typing slowly)

441
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:41.363
(Bell rings)

442
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.288
(Typing extremely slow)

443
00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:52.749
(Typing slowly)

444
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.877
(Typing normally)

445
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.255
(Barely typing)

446
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:06.096
(Typing quickly)

447
00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:17.774
You need a secretary. Pick one.

448
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.988
I don't know how.
They're all so qualified.

449
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.408
You have to choose.

450
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:28.660
(Sighs)

451
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.806
Photographer: Prosze sie
iadnie usmiechac. Big smile. Big smile.

452
00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:32.914
Uwaga.

453
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:34.583
(Camera shutter clicks)

454
00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:40.088
(Playing stately music on piano)

455
00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:55.854
If you would,
look after my guest.

456
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.650
Schindler: Boxed
teas are good. Coffee, paté,

457
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.613
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, beluga caviar.

458
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.365
Yes. And, of course,

459
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:07.592
who could live
without German cigarettes?

460
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.242
Get me as many as you can find.

461
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.203
And some more fresh fruit.

462
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.623
The real rarities,
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

463
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.209
I need several boxes
of Cuban cigars. The best.

464
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.628
Yes. And dark,
unsweetened chocolate.

465
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:21.689
Not in the shape of
ladyfingers, the chunk chocolate.

466
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.715
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

467
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.800
Yes.

468
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:28.136
We 're going to need lots of
cognac. The best, hennessy.

469
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.516
Dom Pérignon champagne.
Get I'espadon sardines,

470
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:36.228
and, oh, try to find
nylon stockings.

471
00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:42.609
Schindler: It is my distinct
pleasure to announce

472
00:31:42.692 --> 00:31:46.321
the fully operational status
of deutsche emailwarenfabrik.

473
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.407
Foreman: Patrz jakies szmaty!

474
00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:52.786
Manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery,

475
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:57.749
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

476
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:01.378
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

477
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.880
d.e. F.'S staff of
highly skilled and

478
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:06.299
experienced
artisans and journeymen

479
00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:09.344
deliver a product of
unparalleled quality,

480
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:14.224
enabling me to proffer, with
absolute confidence and pride,

481
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:16.768
a full line of
field and kitchenware

482
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:19.855
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

483
00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:23.358
See attached list
and available colors.

484
00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:28.196
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval

485
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.325
and looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association,

486
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:35.912
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude

487
00:32:35.996 --> 00:32:38.874
and very best regards.
Oskar schindler.

488
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.252
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

489
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:44.963
Nine hundred,
no, make it 10 for Wednesday.

490
00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:46.882
All this stuff here
goes to madritsch's

491
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.842
factory on Tuesday of next week.

492
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.518
(Horn honking)

493
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:08.403
Schindler: My father was fond of
saying, "you need three things in life,

494
00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:14.284
"a good doctor, a forgiving
priest, and a clever accountant."

495
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:23.126
The first two,
I've never had much use for.

496
00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.545
But the third...

497
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:35.222
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

498
00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:41.645
Isthatah?

499
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:50.570
I'm trying to thank you.
I'm saying

500
00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:53.615
I couldn't have
done this without you.

501
00:33:57.827 --> 00:34:00.372
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

502
00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:02.958
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

503
00:34:05.627 --> 00:34:07.671
You're welcome.

504
00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:11.466
(Sighs)

505
00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.640
Get out of here.

506
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:24.729
(Door buzzes)

507
00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:34.155
Schindler: Klonowska, who is it?

508
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:48.003
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

509
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:02.183
You know something?
You would like her.

510
00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:04.269
Oskar, please. What?

511
00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:06.664
I don't have to like herjust
because you do. You would, though.

512
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:08.815
It doesn't work that way.

513
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:13.278
(Door closes)

514
00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.748
You've done well here.

515
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.711
You look wonderful.

516
00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:34.591
Be careful of the step, miss.

517
00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:36.343
Mrs. Schindler, marek.

518
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:43.683
(Gloomy Sunday playing)

519
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:51.149
It's not a charade, all this?

520
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:52.692
How could it be a charade?

521
00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:54.176
The clothes,
the car, the apartment.

522
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:55.612
Wait a minute.

523
00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:58.573
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

524
00:35:58.657 --> 00:35:59.783
Oskar.

525
00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:04.454
My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

526
00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:06.748
Three hundred and fifty workers

527
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:09.084
on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

528
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.961
To make pots and pans?

529
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.964
To make money. For me.

530
00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.300
(Sighs)

531
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.724
Does anyone ask about me?

532
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:29.854
Back home? Everybody.

533
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.107
All the time.

534
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:33.983
Hmm.

535
00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:41.449
They won't soon forget the name
schindler here, I can tell you that.

536
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:45.787
"Oskar schindler," they1lsay.

537
00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:49.124
"Everybody remembers him.

538
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:53.795
"He did something extraordinary.

539
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:58.299
"He did something
no one else did.

540
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.846
"He came here with nothing,

541
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.974
"a suitcase,

542
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:10.437
"and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory.

543
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.233
"And left with a steamer trunk.

544
00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:18.653
"Two steamer
trunks full of money.

"All the riches of the world."

546
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:26.202
Hmm.

547
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.789
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

548
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:32.584
You're wrong, Emilie.

549
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.755
There's no way I could
have known this before,

550
00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:39.174
but there was
always something missing.

551
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:43.803
In every business I tried, I can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.

552
00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:46.139
Something was missing.

553
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:50.268
Even if I'd known what it was, there's
nothing I could have done about it,

554
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:53.730
because you can't
create this thing.

555
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.027
And it makes all the difference in
the world between success and failure.

556
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:02.489
Luck?

557
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.534
War.

558
00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:11.331
(Ballroom dance music playing)

559
00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.394
Should I stay?

560
00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:38.817
It's a beautiful city.

561
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.904
I asked you if I should stay.

562
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.909
It's up to you.

563
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:56.960
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman
or mattre d' will ever presume

564
00:38:57.043 --> 00:39:00.797
I'm anyone other than
Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

565
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:05.927
Goodbye, darling.

566
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:09.806
(Speaking indistinctly)

567
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:27.448
I could try to read this, or I could
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

568
00:39:28.074 --> 00:39:29.450
We're doing well?

569
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:30.994
Yes.
Better this month than last?

570
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.077
Yes.

571
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.597
Any reason to think
next month will be worse?

572
00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:35.248
The war could end.

573
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:47.969
What?

574
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.238
There is a machinist outside

575
00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:52.223
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

576
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.477
Every day he comes. He's very
grateful. It'll just take a minute.

577
00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:05.528
Mr. Lowenstein?

578
00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:18.625
I want to thank you, sir, for
giving me the opportunity to work.

579
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:21.210
You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

580
00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:25.840
The ss beat me up.
They would have killed me,

581
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:30.762
but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

582
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:32.430
That's great.

583
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.849
I work hard for you.

584
00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:37.310
I'm sure you do.

585
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.270
Hlconfinueto work hard for you.

586
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:41.564
That's great. Thanks.

587
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:42.774
God bless you, sir.

588
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.025
All right.

589
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.152
You are a good man.

590
00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:50.990
He saved my life.

591
00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.200
Yes, he did.

592
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:54.035
God bless him.

593
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:55.328
Yeah. Come on.

594
00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:00.041
God bless you.

595
00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:15.264
Stern: I'm sorry, herr direktor,
but you're running very late.

596
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:18.142
This is for
the obersturmbannftihrer, sir.

597
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:21.437
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

598
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:23.356
Greta as in garbo.

599
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:25.316
By the way, don't
ever do that to me again.

600
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:27.151
Go, go, drive! Don't bow.

601
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.213
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm?

602
00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:30.238
Did he?

603
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:35.994
What's his use?

604
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.245
Very useful.

605
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:41.582
How?

606
00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:43.001
Very useful! Success!

607
00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:53.636
Achrar kach loe nedah...

608
00:42:12.822 --> 00:42:15.116
Officer: Besen und schaufeln
werden ausgeladen

609
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.481
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die strabe gereinigt.

610
00:42:17.827 --> 00:42:19.704
We'll be late for work.

611
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.289
(Horn honking)

612
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.053
Czu rda: You shouldn't
think of them as yours, Oskar.

613
00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.472
You need to understand that
some of the officers here

614
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:39.474
don't give a damn
about production.

615
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.352
To them, it's
a matter of national priority

616
00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:46.189
that Jews be
made to shove! Snow.

617
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:50.985
It's got nothing to do with reality,
Oskar. You know it and I know it.

618
00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:56.908
Jews shoveling snow,
it's got a ritual significance.

619
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:02.205
Come with me.

620
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.998
I am an essential worker.

621
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:05.122
Essential worker? (Laughs)

622
00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:06.250
Yes.

623
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.419
(Officer laughing)

624
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.506
I work for Oskar schindler.

625
00:43:11.672 --> 00:43:13.508
Essential worker
for Oskar schindler.

626
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.911
A one-armed Jew?
Twice as useless!

627
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.344
Yes, yes.

628
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.431
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

629
00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:22.934
Lowenstein:
I work for Oskar schindler.

630
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.855
Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow!

631
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:29.357
(Gunshot)

632
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.863
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

633
00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:39.033
File a grievance with the
economic office. It's your right.

634
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:40.201
Would it do any good?

635
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:42.370
Of course not. (Chuckles)

636
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:48.167
A big shot from the ss budget and
construction office came to lunch,

637
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.797
and he told us that to believe the
Jewish skilled worker had a place

638
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.134
in reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

639
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:05.351
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

640
00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:07.812
He was a metal press operator.

641
00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:14.068
Quite skilled.

642
00:44:16.696 --> 00:44:18.447
(Moaning)

643
00:44:26.873 --> 00:44:28.583
(Panting and moaning)

644
00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:45.433
Herr direktor?

645
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:48.394
Shit. I don't believe it.

646
00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:50.688
Stern, is that you?

647
00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:54.442
No, it's poldek.
It's about stern.

648
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.279
Soldier on pa: Leave your
luggage on the platform.

649
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:04.493
Clearly label it. Given name
first, then your surname.

650
00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:07.622
Do not bring your
baggage with you.

651
00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:10.249
It will follow you later.

652
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:16.130
Leave your luggage on
the platform. Clearly label it.

653
00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:19.300
Man on loudspeaker:
Lassen sie ihr gepack am bahnsteig.

654
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:22.678
Stern?

655
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:26.682
He's on the list.

656
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:27.975
He is?

657
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.144
Well, let's find him.

658
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:31.520
I'm sorry. You can't have him.

659
00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:34.899
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker he would not be on the list.

660
00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:37.151
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

661
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:38.819
Sir, the list is correct.

662
00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.446
I didn't ask you about the list.

663
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:41.697
I asked you your name.

664
00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:42.990
Klaus tauber.

665
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:46.619
Taubel

666
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:50.706
hauptscharfu'hrer, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

667
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.125
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

668
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:55.646
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production

669
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.672
and the armaments board
will want to know why.

670
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.441
Man on loudspeaker:
Achtung, dieser zug fahrtjetzt ab.

671
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.634
Is he on the list?

672
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.928
Yes, sir. Itzhak stern.

673
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:09.350
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

674
00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:12.144
What is your name?

675
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.622
Soldier on pa:
Close and secure all doors.

676
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:16.983
My name? My name is kunder.
This train is now leaving.

677
00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.110
Kunden hauptscharfu'hrer kunder.

678
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:21.112
K-u-n-d-e-r. And what's yours?

679
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:23.489
Schindler. S-c-h-i-n-d-I-e-r.

680
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:26.117
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

681
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.661
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be

682
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:31.956
in southern Russia before
the end of the month. Good day.

683
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:34.399
Conductor: Zamykac dokladnie
drzwi. Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.

684
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:37.420
Stern!

685
00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:40.089
Stern! Stern!

686
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:41.549
Itzhak stern!

687
00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.217
(Train whistle blowing)

688
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:50.558
Stern! Itzhak stern!

689
00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:52.059
Kunder: Stern! Stern!

690
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:53.477
Itzhak stern!

691
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.147
Stern!

692
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.398
Sir?

693
00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:02.528
Stern! Herr direktor.

694
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:03.821
(Coughing)

695
00:47:03.904 --> 00:47:05.489
My apologies.

696
00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:07.116
Stop the train! He's here!

697
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:08.492
I apologize.

698
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.745
Stop the train!

699
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.788
Stop the train! Stop it!

700
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.095
Sign here. Initial there.

701
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.222
(Whistle blowing)

702
00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:34.268
Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one.

703
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:37.080
(Train whistle blowing)
It's the inconvenience to the list.

704
00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:38.814
It's the paperwork.

705
00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:40.691
I somehow left my
work card at home.

706
00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:43.944
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

707
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.781
I'm sorry, it was stupid!

708
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:48.824
What if I got here
five minutes later?

709
00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:51.410
Then where would I be?

710
00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:36.140
Sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.

711
00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:38.976
Tzukeer end sacrean.

712
00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:42.396
"Jewish town"
krakow ghetto winter '42

713
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:45.483
I woke up from
a dream this morning.

714
00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:49.653
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

715
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:52.448
only to discover I
was broke and sharing

716
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:55.326
a room with 12
people I didn't know.

717
00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:57.036
(Chuckung) You laugh about it?

718
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.370
Ihavetolaugh.

719
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.165
You are living behind walls.

720
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:06.170
The walls I can deal with. It's the
restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

721
00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:09.340
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

722
00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:12.259
I like it here. There's
a kind of, I don't know,

723
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:14.720
ancestral squalor to it all.

724
00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.990
You are a slave to these people.
No one envies us anymore.

725
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.015
I'm smart.

726
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.183
Oh, yes, you're smart.

727
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.267
You're a real genius.

728
00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:21.477
You had your chance.

729
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:25.940
Today, today I actually found
time to organize a thought.

730
00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:29.443
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

731
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.278
When's the last
time we did this?

732
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.572
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

733
00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:36.450
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

734
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:39.203
No one took my
business away from me.

735
00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:41.413
You don't really
have a business to take.

736
00:50:41.914 --> 00:50:43.791
There's nowhere down from here.

737
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.834
This is it. This is the bottom.

738
00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:49.129
The ghetto is Liberty.

739
00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:59.640
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

740
00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:07.481
Right side, ghetto a, civil employees,
industrial workers, and so on.

741
00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:12.069
Left side,
ghetto b, surplus labor,

742
00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:15.447
the elderly and infirm, mostly.

743
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:18.492
Which is where you
will want to start.

744
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:19.910
Do you have any questions, sir?

745
00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:21.074
Untersturmfuhrer amon goeth

746
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.789
ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

747
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:29.169
Kunde: We expect a labor
force of 25,000 to 30,000.

748
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:30.730
Plaszow forced labor camp
under construction

749
00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.816
segregated, of course. The men
in the barracks near the quarry.

750
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.359
The women on
the other side of the wire.

751
00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:36.468
Goeth: My place is where?
There, sir.

752
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.345
There? Yes, the villa.

753
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:39.847
You call that a villa?

754
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.157
Their synagogue, can you see it?

755
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:42.308
That's not a villa.

756
00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:44.119
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.

757
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:45.144
It's a house.

758
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.605
Goeth: What's that over there?

759
00:51:50.065 --> 00:51:51.984
Kunde: Kindergarten. Fifty-one.

760
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:56.572
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

761
00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.535
There they are, sir.

762
00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:05.080
(Sniffs) Hmm.

763
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:10.252
One of you is a very lucky girl.

764
00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:15.716
There is an opening
for a job away from all

765
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:20.012
this backbreaking
work at my new villa.

766
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:21.555
(Sniffs)

767
00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:29.063
Which of you has
domestic experience?

768
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:36.779
Ja, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

769
00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:40.074
All those annoying
habits I have to undo.

770
00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:47.915
(Chuckles) I don't want
to give you my cold.

771
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.084
What's your name?

772
00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:52.586
Helen Hirsch. What?

773
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.963
Helen Hirsch. (Coughing)

774
00:52:55.047 --> 00:52:56.840
What? I can't hear.

775
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.759
Helen Hirsch.

776
00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.361
Woman: Take it all down!

777
00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:19.571
(Officer blows whistle)
Officer: To work!

778
00:53:21.657 --> 00:53:24.368
Woman: Take it down!
It is not safe!

779
00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:27.496
She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down.

780
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:30.541
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking hotel europa.

781
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:34.420
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

782
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:38.424
Herr kommandant.
The entire foundation

783
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.969
has to be torn
down and re-poured.

784
00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.763
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence

785
00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:47.599
at the southern
end of the barracks.

786
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:50.978
Subsidence, and then collapse.

787
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.063
And you are an engineer? Yes.

788
00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.315
My name is Diana reiter.

789
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:58.819
I'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the university of Milan.

790
00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.489
An educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

791
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:12.624
Unterscharfu'hrer! Jawohl?

792
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.586
Shoothen

793
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:16.879
what?

794
00:54:17.212 --> 00:54:18.213
(Gasps)

795
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:22.926
Herr kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

796
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.553
Ja, I'm doing mine.

797
00:54:24.636 --> 00:54:26.972
But, sir, she's
foreman of construction.

798
00:54:27.055 --> 00:54:29.767
We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

799
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.976
Okay.

800
00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:36.607
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

801
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:49.620
It will take more than that.

802
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.038
Goeth: I'm sure you're right.

803
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:03.634
Take it down, re-pour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

804
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:07.930
We have more to see, but we
have only one more hour of light.

805
00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.559
(Humming)

806
00:55:19.566 --> 00:55:21.443
Goeth: Today is history.

807
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.906
Today will be remembered.

808
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:33.372
Years from now, the young will
ask with wonder about this day.

809
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.793
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

810
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:43.131
Six hundred years ago,

811
00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:45.819
(singing morning prayer) When
elsewhere they were footing the blame

812
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:48.262
for the black death,
kazimierz the great...

813
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.806
Ke laolam chasedo

814
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:55.185
so-called, told the Jews
they could come to krakow.

815
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.269
They came.

816
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:58.105
Not that fat. No, less.

817
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.023
They trundled their
belongings into the city.

818
00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:01.108
Yes, a bit less.

819
00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:02.317
They settled.

820
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:05.404
They took hold.

821
00:56:05.487 --> 00:56:11.034
They prospered in business,
science, education, the arts.

822
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.705
They came here with nothing.

823
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:16.123
(Praying continues)

824
00:56:16.748 --> 00:56:17.958
Nothing.

825
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:20.752
And they flourished.

826
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:26.842
For six centuries there
has been a Jewish krakow.

827
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:29.803
Think about that.

828
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:32.264
By this evening,

829
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:35.893
those six centuries are a rumor.

830
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.521
They never happened.

831
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:43.317
Today is history.

832
00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:02.502
Liquidation of the ghetto
march 13, 1943

833
00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:07.174

834
00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:10.427
Kameraden! Schneller!

835
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.095
(Whistle blowing)
(Indistinct shouting)

836
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:18.143
I think we will
start with ghetto b.

837
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.062
Soldiers: Hopp, hopp,
hopp, hopp!

838
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:23.649
(Dogs barking)

839
00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:29.112
All right?

840
00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:30.322
Start from both sides?

841
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.342
No, no, I would like you to
start there. The right side?

842
00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:33.676
The right side, yeah.
And then move around.

843
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.868
All right.

844
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:41.541
Man on loudspeaker: Beschriften sie
es deutlich. Es wird ihnen nachgeschickt.

845
00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:45.128
Lassen sie ihr gepack stehen.

846
00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.175
Beschriften sie es deutlich.

847
00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:53.178
Es wird ihnen nachgeschickt.

848
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:55.806
Soldier: Aufmachen!

849
00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:57.224
Lakoom.

850
00:57:57.516 --> 00:58:00.556
Loe ani loe yodahat olay kaday lehachnese

851
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.021
Mitacht la meeta. Bohow.

852
00:58:07.985 --> 00:58:10.070
Soldiers: Hopp, hopp,
hopp, hopp!

853
00:58:10.404 --> 00:58:12.155
(Soldiers shouting in German)

854
00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:53.947
Soldiers: Runterkommen!

855
00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:58.326
(Soldiers banging on doors)

856
00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:02.873
Soldier: Rauskommen, juden!

857
00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.755
Soldier: Na platz!

858

(Whistle blowing)

859
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.807
Gold, Chaim!

860
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.392
Platz chodi.

861
00:59:23.143 --> 00:59:24.311

862
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:25.687
Yes, Chaim gold.

863
00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:27.397
Shoot him.

864
00:59:27.481 --> 00:59:30.609
(Speaking Polish)

865
00:59:33.612 --> 00:59:36.114
Nie zabijaj! Nie zabijaj!

866
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:37.824
(Woman screams)

867
00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:40.708
Soldier: Ziehen sie warme kleidung
an und begeben sie sich zum platz...

868
00:59:41.286 --> 00:59:43.997
Keine koffer! Keine koffer!

869
00:59:44.164 --> 00:59:45.373

Keine koffer! Keine koffer!

871
00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.462
Hey, little boy.

(Running footsteps approaching)

881
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.000
We're getting out
through the sewers.

882
01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.794
I have to check
if they're clear.

883
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.422
Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger than this.

884
01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:37.509
I can't go in the sewers. I told
you I won't go in the sewers.

885
01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:44.391
You can go. Yes, you can.

886
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.020
I won't go in the sewers.

887

(Woman wailing in German)

897

898
01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.431
Mit diesem scheibgewehr hattest

(Door bursts open)

910
01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.798
She's good as dead. Leave her.

911
01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:25.260
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

912
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.596
(People screaming)

913

(Man announcing in German on pa)

914
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:34.686

Women to the left,

922
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.957
Promise me, be safe.

923
01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:00.837
Your government is
in the wrong country!

(Screams)

934
01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.097
You have a blauschein.

935
01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.640
Blauschein
doesn't matter anymore,

936
01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.267
they are
cleaning out the ghetto.

937
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.893
There is not
enough room for you.

938
01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.603
What are you talking about?
We tried it

939
01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:42.355
before. There's
more than enough room.

940
01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.023
I changed my mind!

941
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.400
Mama!

942
01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.902
Oh, look at the space in there.

943
01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:50.280
Now look at me.
You are just scared.

944
01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.449
I can fit the girl, but not you.

945
01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.616
Mama, I'm coming out!

946
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:54.826
Stay where you are.

947
01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.162
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

948
01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:58.538
Mama!

949

Herr kommandant!
(Soldiers laughing)

952
01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.730
Very good saluting.

953
01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.732
I respectfully report
I've been given orders

954
01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.775
to clear the bundles
from the road,

955
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.904
so there will be no
obstructions to the thoroughfare.

956
01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:35.533
Finish and join the lines,

Yes.

961
01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:04.354
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

962
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.023
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

963
01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.275
No, get under the stairs.
They'll be done

You'll be safe there.

yours that stands to benefit most

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.562
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.

1079
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.129
My pleasure. Julius.

1080
01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.839
How are you? You lost weight.

1081
01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:59.925
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

1082
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:04.013
How are you doing?
Oskar schindler.

1083
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.266
We started without you.

1084
01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.934
Fine. I miss anything good?

1085
01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.188
I was explaining to herr bosch
and herr madritsch

1086
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:15.357
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into plaszow.

1087
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.276
I meant the food. (Chuckles)

1088
01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.198
Since your labor
is housed on-site,

1089
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.283
it's available to
you at all times.

1090
01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.036
You can work them
all night if you want.

1091
01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.330
Your factory policies,
whatever they've

1092
01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.707
been in the past,
they'll continue to be.

1093
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.459
They'll be respected.

1094
01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.836
I have to know,
where do you get a suit

1095
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.796
like that?
What is that? Is that silk?

1096
01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:39.298
Of course.

1097
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.470
It has a nice sheen about it.

1098
01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.554
Thank you.

1099
01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:46.722
Very nice.

1100
01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:50.142
I'd say I'd get you one, but the
man who made it is probably dead.

1101
01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.977
I don't know.

1102
01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:55.231
Schindler:
I go to work the other day.

1103
01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.651
Nobody's there.

1104
01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.363
Nobody tells me about this. I
have to find out. I have to go in.

1105
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.157
Everybody's gone.

1106
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.826
No. (Sighs)

1107
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:16.502
They're not gone. They're here.

1108
01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:21.924
They're mine! Every day
that goes by, I'm losing money.

1109
01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.676
Every worker that is
shot costs me money.

1110
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.445
I have to find somebody else.
I have to train them.

1111
01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.989
We are going to be
making so much money

1112
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.514
that none of this
is going to matter.

1113
01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.724
It's bad business.

1114
01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.270
(Sniffs)

1115
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.030
Thank you.

1116
01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:46.991
Leave the bottle.

1117
01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:50.494
Take that.

1118
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.373
Lena, thank you.

1119
01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.219
Scherner told me
something else about you.

1120
01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.765
Yeah? What's that?

1121
01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:16.395
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude."

1122
01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:20.232
That it's not some
vague thing with you

1123
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.818
like it is with others.

1124
01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.405
You want to stay where you are.

1125
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.742
You've got things
going on the side.

1126
01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:32.578
Things are good.

1127
01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:36.081
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

1128
01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:41.378
I can understand all that,
you know. I know you.

1129
01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:48.677
What you want is
your own sub-camp.

1130
01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.686
Do you have any idea what is
involved? The paperwork alone,

1131
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.289
and then you've got to
build the fucking thing.

1132
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.982
Getting the fucking permits is
enough to drive you crazy.

1133
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.192
Then the engineers show up,

1134
01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:06.028
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,

1135
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:07.821
codes, exact specifications,

1136
01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.698
parallel fences
four kilometers long,

1137
01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.242
1,200 kilograms of
barbed wire, (chuckung)

1138
01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:15.037
6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators,

1139
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.880
three cubic meters of
air space per prisoner.

1140
01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.100
I'm telling you, you want to shoot
somebody. I've been through it,

1141
01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.709
you know? I know.

1142
01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:23.545
Well, you know. You've
been through it. (Spits)

1143
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.635
You could make
things easier for me.

1144
01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.640
I'd be grateful.

1145
01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.479
Soldier: Aus dem weg da!

1146
01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.154
(Dogs barking)

1147
01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:52.032
Soldier: Weitergehen!
Weitergehen!

1148
01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:53.909
(Soldier speaking in Polish)

1149
01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.578
(Whistle blowing)

1150
01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.831
(Soldier giving orders
in Polish)

1151
01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:12.136
Where's stern?

1152
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:19.893
Goldberg and chilowicz,
make sure I see my out

1153
01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:23.355
from the factory
owners in this camp.

1154
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:26.859
Leaving you to take
care of my main account,

1155
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.486
the schindler account.

1156
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:34.491
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

1157
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:36.493
But independence costs money.

1158
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:39.788
This, you understand?

1159
01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.711
Look at me.

1160
01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.559
Don't forget who you
are working for now.

1161
01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.399
(Woman shrieking)

1162
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:08.984
(Accordion music playing)

1163
01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.486
Man: Jawohl!

1164
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.864
Schindler: Make sure he stays.
He's a slippery bastard!

1165
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.498
We need more wine.

1166
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:23.790
More wine!

1167
01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.418
Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.

1168
01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:34.134
(Guests chattering and laughing)

1169
01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.014
(Guests singing in German)

1170
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.143
(Toasting in German)

1171
01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:45.270
Was passiert denn in einem leben

1172
01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:46.605
prost! Prost!

1173
01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.276
Thank you, herr direktor.

1174
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:52.653
Prost, herr direktor!

1175
01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.618
What are you doing?

1176
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.537
What? Scratching my head.

1177
01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.831
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps make them keep their distance.

1178
01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.292
Do you have lice?

1179
01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:08.499
Do you have your notebook?

1180
01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.420
The calendar on my
desk has the birthdays

1181
01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.381
of our ss friends'
wives and children.

1182
01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:13.882
Don't forget to send something.

1183
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.528
Record payoffs to
the main administration

1184
01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:18.011
and economics office, the arm...

1185
01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:19.805
Slowly, stern, slowly.

1186
01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:22.891
The armaments board, governor
general's division of the interior

1187
01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.394
and chief of police as "fees."

1188
01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:27.646
And make them on
the first of each month,

1189
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.232
as opposed to individual
payoffs to our ss contacts.

1190
01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.293
The list is in the lower
drawer of my desk, which you...

1191
01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.319
"First of month..."

1192
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.948
Ss contacts list, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle

1193
01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:40.284
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities

1194
01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.619
sent, of course,
to each official's office.

1195
01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.997
Dealings with our
black market contacts

1196
01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.416
listed as suppliers in
the legitimate ledger

1197
01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.334
are more complicated. Forget it.

1198
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.312
What do you mean, forget it?
You can't forget it.

1199
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.422
It gives me a headache.
It gives me a headache!

1200
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.049
(Dogs barking)

1201
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.801
(Sighs)

1202
01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.055
I couldn't get you out of here.

1203
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.765
I'll be all right.

1204
01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:08.604
Anyway, I'm here almost every
week. Wednesdays, usually.

1205
01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:11.398
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

1206
01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:17.279
Here, put these in your pocket.

1207
01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:19.114
Come on.

1208
01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.370
Herr direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

1209
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.205
I've worked too hard.

1210
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:39.843
Thanks for... good luck.

1211
01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.867
Achtung, mu'tzen ab!

1212
01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:16.296
Work! An die arbeit!

1213
01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.966
Metalworks factory inside
plaszow forced labor camp.

1214
01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.355
What are you making?

1215
01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:34.856
Hinges, sir.

1216
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.278
I've got some
workers coming in tomorrow.

1217
01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.072
Where the hell they from again?

1218
01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:44.241
Yugoslavia, herr kommandant.

1219
01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.451
I've got to make room.

1220
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.580
Make me a hinge.

1221
01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.207
Yes, sir.

1222
01:26:57.587 --> 01:26:59.715
(Guards muttering)

1223
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.450
Keep going, you're doing well.

1224
01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:37.878
Oh, that's very good.

1225
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:42.466
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

1226
01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:46.261
What I don't understand
is that you've been working

1227
01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:50.182
since I think, what,
about 6:00 this morning?

1228
01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:55.604
Yet, such a small pile
of hinges.

1229
01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.446
(Train whistle blows)

1230
01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.540
(Gun clicks)

1231
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.802
(Gun clicks) Oh, Christ.

1232
01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:27.969
May I try that, sir?

1233
01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.305
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

1234
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:33.517
No, no. You wouldn't hear a
click if it was the angle lever.

1235
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.852
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

1236
01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:37.062
Ja, come on.

1237
01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:38.313
What did I just say? Here.

1238
01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:41.650
(Gun clicks)

1239
01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:43.735
Herr kommandant.

1240
01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:49.574
I beg to report that my heap
of hinges was so unsatisfactory

1241
01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:53.245
because the machines were
being recalibrated this morning.

1242
01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.329
(Gun clicks)

1243
01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.250
I was put on to shoveling coal.

1244
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.921
(Gun clicking)

1245
01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.343
(Grunts)

1246
01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:10.762
(Yells)

1247
01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:11.847
(Sobbing)

1248
01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.733
Strange, huh?

1249
01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:25.694
Yeah.

1250
01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.534
Thank you, muek.

1251
01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:38.081
Ah, lisiek. Don't touch the
leather, it's just been oiled.

1252
01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.791
Rottenfuhrer. Oh, for me?

1253
01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.501
Oh, thank you very much,
herr direktor.

1254
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:42.961
Stern: Herr direktor!

1255
01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.797
Herr direktor!

1256
01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.427
Herr direktor.

1257
01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:54.723
He was making hinges slowly.

1258
01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.725
So the man can
turn out a hinge in

1259
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.810
less than a minute.
Why the long story?

1260
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.590
(Machines whirring)

1261
01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.050
Thank you, sir.

1262
01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:31.551
You're welcome.

1263
01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.933
Nobody knows who
stole the chicken, hmm?

1264
01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.100
Tell him about the chicken.

1265
01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:42.687
A man walks around with a
chicken and nobody notices this.

1266
01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.357
Save yourselves.

1267
01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.360
Tell him about the chicken.

1268
01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.544
Still nobody knows.

1269
01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:11.132
(Sobbing)

1270
01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:21.977
It was you.
You committed this crime.

1271
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.186
No, sir.

1272
01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.437
But you know who, though.

1273
01:31:24.521 --> 01:31:26.356
Who? Yes.

1274
01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:30.026
Him!

1275
01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.782
He's very gifted.

1276
01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:37.742
Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

1277
01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:44.165
Sir. Thank you.

1278
01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.506
Thank you again, herr direktor.

1279
01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:53.008
You're welcome again.

1280
01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.593
It's an honor to work
for such a great company.

1281
01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:56.678
It's great to have you.

1282
01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:59.764
I promise to learn everything there is
to know about enamelware production.

1283
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.057
That's great.

1284
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.407
Hello? Miss Elsa krause is
here. I only need five minutes.

1285
01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.993
She wants to speak
to the herr direktor.

1286
01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.140
Yes.

1287
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.730
He won't see you.

1288
01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.387
Please, sit down.

1289
01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.101
Pernod? Cognac?

1290
01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.602
No. No, thank you.

1291
01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:31.523
So, what can I do for you?

1292
01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:39.280
They say that no one dies here.

1293
01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.491
They say your
factory is a haven.

1294
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.454
They say you are good.

1295
01:33:49.582 --> 01:33:50.792
Who says that?

1296
01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:53.378
Everyone.

1297
01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.054
My name is Regina perlman,
not Elsa krause.

1298
01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:06.558
I've been living in krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.

1299
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.601
My parents are in plaszow.

1300
01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:12.981
Their names are
Ghana and Jakob perlman.

1301
01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:16.693
They are older people. They are
killing older people now in plaszow.

1302
01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:20.071
They Bury them up
in the forest. Look,

1303
01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:23.783
I don't have any money.

1304
01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:26.786
I borrowed these clothes.

1305
01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:32.750
I'm begging you. Please.

1306
01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.461
Please bring them here.

1307
01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:38.131
I don't do that.

1308
01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:41.926
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.

1309
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.845
Whether or not the
worker has certain skills.

1310
01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.447
That's what I ask
and that's what I care about.

1311
01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:47.891
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1312
01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:51.436
Such activities are illegal. You will not
entrap me! (Continues arguing)

1313
01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:57.108
Cry, and I will have you
arrested. I swear to god!

1314
01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:58.443
(Sobbing)

1315
01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:09.204
People die. It's a fact of life.

1316
01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:11.039
He wants to kill everybody?
Great!

1317
01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.957
What am I
supposed to do about it?

1318
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:15.793
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1319
01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.713
Send them over to
schindler. Send them all!

1320
01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:22.675
His place is a haven, didn't
you know? It's not a factory.

1321
01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.844
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1322
01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.764
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans

1323
01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.975
and people with no
skills whatsoever!

1324
01:35:31.184 --> 01:35:32.185
(Sighs)

1325
01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.980
You think I don't
know what you're doing?

1326
01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:39.525
You're so quiet all the
time. I know, I know!

1327
01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:40.777
Are you losing money?

1328
01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:42.070
That's not the point!

1329
01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.113
So the point is?

1330
01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.199
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

1331
01:35:50.536 --> 01:35:53.998
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

1332
01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.709
You have to think of
it in his situation.

1333
01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.338
He's got this
whole place to run.

1334
01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:03.258
He's responsible for
everything here, all these people.

1335
01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:05.426
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

1336
01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:10.682
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

1337
01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:14.644
Never the good, always
the bad. Always the bad.

1338
01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:21.276
But in normal circumstances he
wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

1339
01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.404
There'd just be the good
aspects of him, which...

1340
01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.488
(Chuckles)

1341
01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.324
He's a wonderful crook.

1342
01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:32.704
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...

1343
01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:34.289
Killing.

1344
01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.125
He can't enjoy it.

1345
01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:41.629
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped

1346
01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.965
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1347
01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.136
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

1348
01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:51.973
He shot the man to the left of
bejski, the man to the right of him.

1349
01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:55.226
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

1350
01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.567
Twenty-five.

1351
01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:09.099
What do you want
me to do about it?

1352
01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.616
Nothing, nothing.

1353
01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.703
We're just talking.

1354
01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:27.216
"Perlman."

1355
01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.928
Perlman!

1356
01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:33.765
Husband and wife.

1357
01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:37.643
Jakob and Ghana perlman!

1358
01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:52.867
Have goldberg bring them over.

1359
01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.705
Soldier: Mu'tzen ab!

1360
01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:01.959
Appell abtreten!

1361
01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:39.163
(Guests singing drunkenly
in German)

1362
01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:52.844
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, lisiek.

1363
01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:57.432
Herr direktor, I was just
helping lisiek to find something

1364
01:38:57.515 --> 01:39:00.268
to clean the stains from the
herr kommandant's bathtub.

1365
01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:01.686
Go clean it.

1366
01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.187
Pardon me, herr direktor.

1367
01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:06.774
(Schindler chuckles)

1368
01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:10.695
You don't have to
report to me, Helen.

1369
01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.448
You know who I am? Hmm?

1370
01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:23.082
(Whispering) I'm schindler.

1371
01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:27.670
Of course. I have heard, and

1372
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:31.549
you have been here before.

1373
01:39:33.843 --> 01:39:36.387
Here, why don't you
keep this some place?

1374
01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:38.389
Go on, take it.

1375
01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:40.099
I get extra food here.

1376
01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:44.687
Well, if you don't want to eat
it, trade it. Or give it to lisiek.

1377
01:39:47.565 --> 01:39:49.775
Why not build yourself up?

1378
01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:58.451
My first day here, he beat me

1379
01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:02.330
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

1380
01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:10.171
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

1381
01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:12.757
He asked me where they were.

1382
01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:19.222
For his dogs, you understand.

1383
01:40:22.308 --> 01:40:26.229
I said to him,
I don't know how I say this.

1384
01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:30.066
I never could say it now,
I said to him,

1385
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:32.401
"why are you beating me?"

1386
01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.575
He said, "the reason
I beat you now

1387
01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:43.287
"is because you
ask why I beat you."

1388
01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:47.333
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1389
01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.255
It doesn't matter.

1390
01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.968
I have accepted them.

1391
01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.595
Accepted them?

1392
01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.724
One day he will shoot me.

1393
01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:06.686
No, no, no, he won't shoot you.

1394
01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:09.522
I know. I see things.

1395
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.734
We were on the roof on Monday,
young lisiek and I,

1396
01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:17.321
and we saw the herr kommandant
come out of the front door

1397
01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:23.244
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,

1398
01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:28.082
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

1399
01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:31.002
shot a woman who was passing by.

1400
01:41:32.378 --> 01:41:35.631
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1401
01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:39.385
Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?

1402
01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:43.097
She was no fatter or thinner

1403
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.766
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1404
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:50.021
and I couldn't
guess what had she done.

1405
01:41:54.525 --> 01:41:57.695
The more you see of
the herr kommandant,

1406
01:41:57.778 --> 01:42:03.367
the more you see there is no
set rules that you can live by.

1407
01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:08.164
You can't say to yourself, "if I
follow these rules, I will be safe."

1408
01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:15.838
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1409
01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.468
He enjoys you so much he
won't even let you wear the star.

1410
01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:22.136
He doesn't want
anyone else to know

1411
01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.930
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1412
01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:31.187
He shot the woman from the steps

1413
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:34.982
because she meant
nothing to him.

1414
01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.818
She was one of a series,

1415
01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:40.571
neither offending
or pleasing him.

1416
01:42:44.533 --> 01:42:46.744
But you, Helen.

1417
01:42:51.123 --> 01:42:55.586
It's all right. It's not
that kind of a kiss.

1418
01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:01.676
(Sobbing)

1419
01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:03.010
Thank you.

1420
01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:04.095
Shh.

1421
01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:10.017
Here.

1422
01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.983
Right. The wine.

1423
01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:28.494
Wonderful party, amon.
Thank you.

1424
01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:30.996
(Groans)

1425
01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:40.047
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1426
01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:43.300
Hmm? I send you good
stuff all the time.

1427
01:43:43.384 --> 01:43:47.179
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1428
01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:49.640
You know, I look at you.
(Sniffs)

1429
01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:52.351
I watch you.

1430
01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:54.937
(Sighs)

1431
01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.355
You're never drunk.

1432
01:43:56.939 --> 01:43:58.524
(Sniffs) Oh, that's...

1433
01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.361
That's real control.

1434
01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:05.823
Control is power.

1435
01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:08.951
That's power.

1436
01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:15.458
Schindler:
Is that why they fear us?

1437
01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:21.964
We have the fucking power
to kill, that's why they fear us.

1438
01:44:22.047 --> 01:44:25.843
They fear us because we
have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1439
01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.845
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1440
01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.848
We have him killed, and
we feel pretty good about it.

1441
01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:33.893
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1442
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.938
That's not power, though.

1443
01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:42.443
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1444
01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:50.367
Power is when we have
everyjustification to kill,

1445
01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:52.870
and we don't.

1446
01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:55.873
You think that's power?

1447
01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:02.087
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

1448
01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:03.672
he's brought in
before the emperor,

1449
01:45:03.756 --> 01:45:08.010
he throws himself down on
the ground, he begs for mercy.

1450
01:45:08.093 --> 01:45:10.471
He knows he's going to die.

1451
01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:16.977
And the emperor pardons him.

1452
01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:21.440
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1453
01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:26.862
I think you are drunk.

1454
01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.699
That's power, amon.

1455
01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:35.246
That is power.

1456
01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:45.923
Amon the good.

1457
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:52.096
I pardon you. (Laughs)

1458
01:45:59.228 --> 01:46:00.228
Goeth: What do they want?

1459
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:03.816
Stern: I don't know, but they're in
my office now reviewing our books.

1460
01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:08.028
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed that the auditors

1461
01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:09.738
are reviewing my books? Well...

1462
01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:11.282
Or have you done
your job properly?

1463
01:46:11.407 --> 01:46:12.825
You needn't be alarmed.

1464
01:46:12.908 --> 01:46:14.660
I needn't be alarmed.

1465
01:46:14.785 --> 01:46:15.911
(Shouts angrily)

1466
01:46:18.539 --> 01:46:20.374
(Gasps) I'm sorry, sir.

1467
01:46:20.457 --> 01:46:22.543
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1468
01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:24.628
Do you know how much it costs?

1469
01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:31.302
All right.

1470
01:46:31.385 --> 01:46:32.636
(Panting)

1471
01:46:33.596 --> 01:46:34.972
All right.

1472
01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:41.145
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1473
01:46:51.697 --> 01:46:54.158
Man on loudspeaker:
Baracken eins, elf

1474
01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:59.246

1475
01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:03.208
(Whistling)

1476
01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:06.378
(Both whistling)

1477
01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:22.102
(Children chattering)

1478
01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.358
(Whimpering)

1479
01:47:29.234 --> 01:47:30.819
She was smoking on the job.

1480
01:47:34.907 --> 01:47:36.742
Tell her not to do it again.

1481
01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:38.702
(Shouting)

1482
01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:44.041
(Footsteps approaching)

1483
01:47:53.175 --> 01:47:54.718
I have to report, sir.

1484
01:47:56.762 --> 01:47:59.640
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1485
01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.146
What are you using, lisiek?

1486
01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:08.065
Soap, commandant.

1487
01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.194
Soap? Not lye?

1488
01:48:22.246 --> 01:48:26.041
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1489
01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:50.107
I pardon you.

1490
01:49:10.127 --> 01:49:11.128
(Gunshot)

1491
01:49:18.802 --> 01:49:19.803
(Gunshot)

1492
01:49:21.972 --> 01:49:22.973
(Gunshot)

1493
01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:28.664
(Sighs)

1494
01:50:42.177 --> 01:50:45.806
Woman: Although I am not
a rabbi, in these circumstances

1495
01:50:45.889 --> 01:50:48.600
I pray to the almighty
that he will forgive me

1496
01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:51.270
if I intone the blessings.

Bo milosc moj mily to ja

1507
01:51:47.409 --> 01:51:50.495
this is where you
come to hide from me.

1508
01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.165
I came to tell you

1509
01:51:54.875 --> 01:51:58.253
that you really
are a wonderful cook

1510
01:51:58.337 --> 01:52:01.548
and a well-trained servant.

1511
01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:06.094
I mean it. If you need
a reference after the war,

1512
01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:10.599
I'd be happy to give you one.

1513
01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:13.560
It must get lonely down here

1514
01:52:13.644 --> 01:52:18.065
when you're listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time.

1515
01:52:25.072 --> 01:52:26.323
Does it?

1516
01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:31.161
You can answer.

1517
01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:37.125
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking.

1518
01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.837
What does he want to hear?

1519
01:52:46.218 --> 01:52:50.222
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1520
01:52:53.141 --> 01:52:55.602
Yes, you're right.

1521
01:52:55.686 --> 01:52:57.521
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1522
01:52:59.356 --> 01:53:01.275
Yes. I...

1523
01:53:02.234 --> 01:53:03.277
(Sighs)

1524
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.695
I mean,

1525
01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.413
I would like so much to

1526
01:53:16.248 --> 01:53:19.710
reach out and touch
you in your loneliness.

1527
01:53:20.919 --> 01:53:24.089
What would that be like,
iwonder? I mean...

1528
01:53:25.257 --> 01:53:28.051
What would be wrong with that?

1529
01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:31.847
I realize that
you're not a person in

1530
01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:34.766
the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1531
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:35.851
(Sighs)

1532
01:53:36.435 --> 01:53:38.353
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know,

1533
01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:42.024
maybe what's wrong isn't...

1534
01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:44.818
It's not us.

1535
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:48.322
It's... no, it's this.

1536
01:53:50.949 --> 01:53:53.660
I mean, when they compare you to

1537
01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:58.582
vermin, and to rodents,
and to lice...

1538
01:54:02.044 --> 01:54:03.295
I just...

1539
01:54:07.049 --> 01:54:09.968
No, you make a good point.

1540
01:54:10.052 --> 01:54:12.554
You make a very good point.

1541
01:54:20.937 --> 01:54:23.398
Is this the face of a rat?

1542
01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:29.112
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1543
01:54:32.074 --> 01:54:34.618
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1544
01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:39.623
Ci wszystko wybaczy

1545
01:54:40.665 --> 01:54:46.046
Bo milosc moj mily

1546
01:54:50.425 --> 01:54:53.887
I feel for you, Helen.

1547
01:54:58.225 --> 01:55:00.769
To ja

1548
01:55:09.486 --> 01:55:11.071
(Panting)

1549
01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:13.156
No, I don't think so.

1550
01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:17.619
You're a Jewish bitch.

1551
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:22.958
You nearly talked me
into it, didn't you?

1552
01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:24.209
Didn't you?

1553
01:55:29.548 --> 01:55:30.674
Bravo.

1554
01:55:32.008 --> 01:55:33.009
(Grunts)

1555
01:55:36.054 --> 01:55:37.806
(Murmuring happily)

1556
01:55:38.223 --> 01:55:39.224

1557
01:55:42.686 --> 01:55:45.021

1558
01:55:45.939 --> 01:55:47.023

1559
01:55:47.107 --> 01:55:51.194
Gu ests: Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!

1560
01:55:53.864 --> 01:55:55.240
Bravo! Man: Bravo!

1561
01:55:56.658 --> 01:55:59.661
Gu ests: Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!

1562
01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.246
(Laughing)

1563
01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:06.251
(Music and talking stops)

1564
01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:08.837
On behalf of the workers, sir,

1565
01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.340
I wish for you a happy birthday.

1566
01:56:12.716 --> 01:56:14.301
Happy birthday.

1567
01:56:14.384 --> 01:56:16.052
Well, the staff, please.

1568
01:56:16.178 --> 01:56:19.848
Thank you very much for the lovely
cake. (Officer clears throat)

1569
01:56:38.575 --> 01:56:41.995
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.

1570
01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:53.590
To ostatnia niedziela

1571
01:56:54.132 --> 01:56:57.219
dzisiaj sie rozstaniemy

1572
01:56:58.303 --> 01:57:02.891
the trains arrived and the
people were driven out with clubs.

1573
01:57:02.974 --> 01:57:06.978
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1574
01:57:07.062 --> 01:57:11.024
One was marked "cloak room,"
and the other "valuables."

1575
01:57:11.107 --> 01:57:13.693
And there they
were made to undress.

1576
01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:18.323
A Jewish boy handed them pieces
of string to tie their shoes together.

1577
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:21.159
They shaved their hair.

1578
01:57:21.243 --> 01:57:23.078
They told them it was needed to

1579
01:57:23.203 --> 01:57:25.080
make something
special for u-boat crews.

1580
01:57:26.623 --> 01:57:30.460
And then they were herded
down a big corridor

1581
01:57:30.544 --> 01:57:34.589
to bunkers with stars
of David on the doors

1582
01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:38.718
and signs that said
"bath and inhalation room."

1583
01:57:38.802 --> 01:57:40.762
Ss gave them soap.

1584
01:57:40.845 --> 01:57:43.265
They told them to
breathe all the time

1585
01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:45.809
because it's good
for disinfecting.

1586
01:57:47.018 --> 01:57:48.937
And then they gassed them.

1587
01:57:50.313 --> 01:57:52.649
Mila, why soaps?

1588
01:57:53.650 --> 01:57:55.211
So that they would
agree to go in, I think.

1589
01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:59.239
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your
bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1590
01:57:59.322 --> 01:58:02.325
Yeah. You know it's ridiculous.

1591
01:58:02.409 --> 01:58:04.077
I cannot believe it.

1592
01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.580
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1593
01:58:06.663 --> 01:58:07.747
From who?

1594
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:10.041
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1595
01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:13.587
You know, if they were there,

1596
01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:15.422
they would have been gassed.

1597

Yes.

1598
01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:18.466
Itdoesnt make any sense.

1599
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:20.635
We're their workforce.

1600
01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:24.598
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?

1601
01:58:24.681 --> 01:58:29.519
To go to all this trouble of
assembling a workforce only to...

1602
01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:31.396
No, it can't be true.

1603
01:58:33.148 --> 01:58:36.276
We are very,
very important for them.

1604
01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:39.446
Woman 1: Yeah, we do now.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.804
Everyone who is alive...

1613
01:59:04.929 --> 01:59:06.073
Mrs. Dresner:

1620
01:59:32.248 --> 01:59:33.541
Meine herren.

Officer: Alle in einer
einzelreihe aufstellen!

1626
01:59:46.346 --> 01:59:48.515
You could afford to
lose some weight, amon.

1627
01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:52.852
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1628
01:59:52.936 --> 01:59:55.605
Morning. What's going on?

1629
01:59:56.356 --> 01:59:59.192
It's another
semi-annual physical.

1630
02:00:00.694 --> 02:00:01.820
There.

1631

Hungahans ja, hungahans

1634
02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:13.456
we've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

That's my mechanic.

1656
02:01:39.584 --> 02:01:42.253
Whose bright idea was
it to get rid of him?

1657
02:01:49.928 --> 02:01:53.515
Ruszaj sie! Naokolo!

That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1753
02:08:53.226 --> 02:08:56.604
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1754
02:08:56.687 --> 02:09:00.858
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!

1755
02:09:00.942 --> 02:09:04.153
Come on, try and reach
the far end. Look out.

1756
02:09:04.237 --> 02:09:06.822
Man: (Wailing)
Water! More water!

1757
02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.287
I've got some 200-meter hoses
back in emalia.

1758
02:09:13.371 --> 02:09:15.248
I have 20 meters at
home in my garden.

1759
02:09:15.331 --> 02:09:17.541
We can reach the cars at the
end. (Officers laughing)

1760
02:09:17.625 --> 02:09:20.169
What? What?

1761
02:09:24.674 --> 02:09:25.675
Hujar.

1762
02:09:25.841 --> 02:09:26.842
Yeah, sure.

1763
02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:30.680
(People shouting)

1764
02:09:40.690 --> 02:09:42.066
(Laughing)

1765
02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:48.072
Don't forget the roof.

1766
02:09:48.155 --> 02:09:50.157
On the roof on the other side.

1767
02:09:57.873 --> 02:10:00.960
Scharftihrer,
every time the train stops

1768
02:10:01.043 --> 02:10:03.796
you open the doors, you
give them water, yeah? Jawohl.

1769
02:10:03.879 --> 02:10:05.715
This car! This car!

1770
02:10:07.258 --> 02:10:09.510
(Woman shrieking)

1771
02:10:30.614 --> 02:10:33.743
Schindler: I'm not saying
you'll regret it, but you might.

1772
02:10:33.826 --> 02:10:35.578
You should be aware of that.

1773
02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:37.830
We will have to risk regret.

1774
02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.917
All right, sure. It's a nice
day. I'll go for a drive with you.

1775
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:19.789
What about you?

1776
02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:23.125
I violated the race
and resettlement act.

1777
02:11:24.251 --> 02:11:28.130
Though I doubt anyone can
point out the actual provision to me.

1778
02:11:28.464 --> 02:11:30.299
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1779
02:11:30.633 --> 02:11:33.636
(Chuckung)

1780
02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:38.015
Did your prick fall off?

1781
02:11:38.307 --> 02:11:40.142
(Both laughing)

1782
02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.773
(Continues laughing)

1783
02:11:56.992 --> 02:11:58.494
Goeth: He likes women.

1784
02:12:01.497 --> 02:12:03.666
He likes good-looking women.

1785
02:12:05.835 --> 02:12:09.004
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1786
02:12:10.506 --> 02:12:11.507
(Chuckles)

1787
02:12:12.049 --> 02:12:13.050
I mean...

1788
02:12:13.134 --> 02:12:15.052
He has so many women.

1789
02:12:15.136 --> 02:12:17.012
And they love him.

1790
02:12:18.055 --> 02:12:20.850
Ja, they love him. I mean,
he is married, ja, but he's...

1791
02:12:22.685 --> 02:12:26.272
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1792
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.108
But you didn't see this girl.

1793
02:12:30.192 --> 02:12:32.695
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof...

1794
02:12:33.696 --> 02:12:35.614
She was very good-looking.

1795
02:12:40.202 --> 02:12:42.621
They cast a spell on you,
you know, the Jews.

1796
02:12:42.705 --> 02:12:44.850
When you work closely with
them, like I do, you see this.

1797
02:12:44.874 --> 02:12:46.792
They have this power.
It's like a virus.

1798
02:12:46.876 --> 02:12:48.794
Some of my men are
infected with this virus.

1799
02:12:48.878 --> 02:12:51.273
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1800
02:12:51.297 --> 02:12:54.216
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1801
02:12:54.341 --> 02:12:56.886
It's a matter of money? Hmm?

1802
02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:00.181
You're offering me a bribe?

1803
02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:06.604
A bribe? No.
No, please. It's a gratuity.

1804
02:13:07.730 --> 02:13:09.023
Heil Hitler!

1805
02:13:13.569 --> 02:13:14.820
Hello, amon.

1806
02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:20.409
Sit down.

1807
02:13:23.370 --> 02:13:26.832
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1808
02:13:27.041 --> 02:13:28.959
You should kiss us, not them.

1809
02:13:29.752 --> 02:13:32.963
God forbid you ever get
a real taste for Jewish skirt.

1810
02:13:33.422 --> 02:13:36.467
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1811
02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:40.429
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1812
02:13:41.764 --> 02:13:43.307
It's policy now.

1813
02:13:46.769 --> 02:13:48.521
Man: Ja, scho'n gefangen! Gut!

1814
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:51.649
(Children laughing)

1815
02:13:56.028 --> 02:13:59.114
Nochmal, ja! Scho'n!

1816
02:14:18.676 --> 02:14:22.471
Chujowa gorka, April, 1944

1817
02:14:23.389 --> 02:14:27.434
department d orders goeth to exhume
and incinerate the bodies of more than

1818
02:14:27.518 --> 02:14:30.062
10,000 Jews killed at plaszow
and the krakow ghetto massacre.

1819
02:14:30.145 --> 02:14:31.689
Soldier: Also iOS! Bewegung!

1820
02:14:31.772 --> 02:14:34.984
Schneller hier!
Zack, Zack, Zack!

1821
02:14:35.651 --> 02:14:37.152
Beweg deinen arsch!

1822
02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.448
Das geht auch schneller!

1823
02:14:41.574 --> 02:14:43.075
Bewegt euch!

1824
02:14:43.158 --> 02:14:44.159
Schlaft nicht ein!

1825
02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:45.536
(Choir singing requiem)

1826
02:14:45.619 --> 02:14:47.371
Nur die ganzen fetzen,
nicht das gemiise!

1827
02:14:47.454 --> 02:14:51.041
Komm, das kannst du mit den
handen machen, fass da vorn an!

1828
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:57.506
Die kleinteile lass iiegen!

1829
02:15:16.233 --> 02:15:20.112
(Screaming insanely)

1830
02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:23.490
(Laughing)
(Conversing in German)

1831
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.702
So ist es! Walhalla!

1832
02:15:27.202 --> 02:15:29.204
Walhalla iauft hier!

1833
02:15:32.041 --> 02:15:33.042
(Requiem continues)

1834
02:15:34.084 --> 02:15:35.669
Goeth: Can you believe this?

1835
02:15:36.086 --> 02:15:39.423
As if I don't have enough to
do, they come up with this?

1836
02:15:39.506 --> 02:15:43.302
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1837
02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:46.406
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing

1838
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:47.907
us down, sending
everybody to Auschwitz.

1839
02:15:47.931 --> 02:15:48.932
When?

1840
02:15:49.016 --> 02:15:50.910
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1841
02:15:50.934 --> 02:15:54.688
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1842
02:16:15.626 --> 02:16:17.020
Schindler:
I've been talking to goeth.

1843
02:16:17.044 --> 02:16:18.337
I know the destination.

1844
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.631
These are the evacuation orders.

1845
02:16:21.215 --> 02:16:24.176
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1846
02:16:24.259 --> 02:16:26.595
That's not what I
was going to say.

1847
02:16:27.471 --> 02:16:30.849
I made goeth promise me
he'll put in a good word for you.

1848
02:16:31.392 --> 02:16:33.112
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you there.

1849
02:16:33.143 --> 02:16:34.770
You'll receive
special treatment.

1850
02:16:34.895 --> 02:16:36.563
The directives
coming in from Berlin

1851
02:16:36.647 --> 02:16:38.732
mention "special treatment"
more and more often.

1852
02:16:38.816 --> 02:16:40.818
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.

1853
02:16:40.943 --> 02:16:42.569
Preferential treatment,
all right?

1854
02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:45.169
Do we have to invent
a whole new language?

1855
02:16:45.614 --> 02:16:46.615
I think so.

1856
02:16:50.452 --> 02:16:52.162
You're staying, I take it.

1857
02:16:56.375 --> 02:16:58.293
In krakow? What on earth for?

1858
02:16:58.419 --> 02:17:00.295
What for? You have
a business to run.

1859
02:17:02.631 --> 02:17:04.776
Of course, you'll have to hire
new workers. Poles, I guess.

1860
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:07.052
They cost a little more, but...

1861
02:17:09.972 --> 02:17:11.682
What are you going to do?

1862
02:17:15.644 --> 02:17:17.563
You ran my business.

1863
02:17:21.483 --> 02:17:23.318
No, I'm going home.

1864
02:17:23.569 --> 02:17:25.028
I've done what I came here for.

1865
02:17:25.112 --> 02:17:28.657
I've got more money than
any man can spend in a lifetime.

1866
02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:44.673
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

1867
02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:51.555
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1868
02:17:55.851 --> 02:17:57.978
I think I better have it now.

1869
02:18:21.376 --> 02:18:22.753
(God bless the child playing)

1870
02:18:22.836 --> 02:18:26.715
Bible says and it still is news

1871
02:18:28.091 --> 02:18:33.889
mama may have papa may have

1872
02:18:34.848 --> 02:18:39.853
but god bless the child
that's got his own

1873
02:18:40.103 --> 02:18:42.815
that's got his own

1874
02:18:46.777 --> 02:18:51.073
yes, the strong gets more

1875
02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.076
while the weak ones fade

1876
02:18:55.994 --> 02:19:01.667
empty pockets don't
ever make the grade

1877
02:19:02.459 --> 02:19:07.840
mama may have papa may have

1878
02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:14.429
but god bless the child
that's got his own

1879
02:19:15.264 --> 02:19:18.267
that's got his own

1880
02:19:23.647 --> 02:19:29.194
Money,
you've got lots of friends

1881
02:19:32.072 --> 02:19:34.700
they're pounding on your...

1882
02:19:34.908 --> 02:19:38.871
Goeth: I don't understand.
You want these people?

1883
02:19:39.079 --> 02:19:41.498
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.

1884
02:19:41.582 --> 02:19:44.585
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1885
02:19:44.668 --> 02:19:46.312
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1886
02:19:46.336 --> 02:19:47.421
It's good business.

1887
02:19:47.504 --> 02:19:49.548
It's good business
in your opinion.

1888
02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:52.718
Look, you've got to move
them, the equipment,

1889
02:19:52.801 --> 02:19:54.219
everything to czechoslovakia.

1890
02:19:54.303 --> 02:19:57.598
Pay for all that and build another
camp. Doesn't make any sense.

1891
02:19:57.681 --> 02:19:59.308
Look, amon... it's good for me.

1892
02:19:59.474 --> 02:20:01.059
You're not telling me something.

1893
02:20:01.143 --> 02:20:03.162
I know them. I'm familiar with
them. I don't have to train them.

1894
02:20:03.186 --> 02:20:04.466
You're not telling me something.

1895
02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:05.790
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1896
02:20:05.814 --> 02:20:07.566
That's right.
It's good for the army.

1897
02:20:07.649 --> 02:20:08.942
Yeah, of course.

1898
02:20:08.984 --> 02:20:11.153
You know what I'm
going to make? What?

1899
02:20:11.486 --> 02:20:13.381
Artillery shells. Everyone's
making artillery shells.

1900
02:20:13.405 --> 02:20:15.174
Tank shells, they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.

1901
02:20:15.198 --> 02:20:18.035
Everybody's happy.
Everyone's happy, except me.

1902
02:20:18.118 --> 02:20:20.996
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1903
02:20:21.413 --> 02:20:24.416
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1904
02:20:24.499 --> 02:20:27.961
And if you admit to 300, then
it's 400, actually. But how?

1905
02:20:28.045 --> 02:20:29.379
I just told you.

1906
02:20:29.504 --> 02:20:30.881
You did, but you didn't.

1907
02:20:33.842 --> 02:20:35.844
Ja, all right, don't tell me.

1908
02:20:36.094 --> 02:20:40.265
I'll go along with it. It's just
irritating I can't work it out.

1909
02:20:40.474 --> 02:20:44.186
Look, all you have to do is
tell me what it's worth to you.

1910
02:20:45.437 --> 02:20:47.940
What's a person worth to you?
No, no, no, no.

1911
02:20:48.023 --> 02:20:50.150
What's one worth to you?

1912
02:20:58.825 --> 02:21:02.371
Poldek pfefferberg.
Mila pfefferberg.

1913
02:21:03.205 --> 02:21:04.289
And...

1914
02:21:06.249 --> 02:21:08.585
Uh... stagel, stagel...

1915
02:21:08.669 --> 02:21:10.128
Paul. Paul stagel.

1916
02:21:10.504 --> 02:21:11.588
Stern: Doctor.

1917
02:21:13.966 --> 02:21:17.719
The investors. I want
all of them. Yes, sir.

1918
02:21:18.762 --> 02:21:20.389
Fischer. Ismail fischer.

1919
02:21:20.514 --> 02:21:23.392
Fischer, ismail.

1920
02:21:24.059 --> 02:21:25.727
Josef scharf.

1921
02:21:25.852 --> 02:21:27.521
One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1922
02:21:27.646 --> 02:21:29.106
Come on, stern. Scharf, scharf.

1923
02:21:32.734 --> 02:21:34.903
The children. All the children.

1924
02:21:40.409 --> 02:21:42.411
Stern: Herbert stier.
Schindler: Thank you.

1925
02:21:42.911 --> 02:21:44.496
How many?

1926
02:21:44.621 --> 02:21:46.248
Four hundred, 450.

1927
02:21:49.418 --> 02:21:50.752
More, more.

1928
02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:18.905
Feigenbaum, Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf wein.

1929
02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:29.374
Feigenbaum, lutek, Jakob...
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1930
02:22:29.458 --> 02:22:31.209
Nacha, that's right.

1931
02:22:31.626 --> 02:22:32.627
Schindler: And wolf.

1932
02:22:33.795 --> 02:22:35.047
How many?

1933
02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:40.260
More. 600.

1934
02:22:42.763 --> 02:22:44.282
Schindler: You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1935
02:22:44.306 --> 02:22:45.724
You might even make money at it.

1936
02:22:45.807 --> 02:22:46.808
Madritsch: I don't know.

1937
02:22:46.892 --> 02:22:49.662
Come on, Julius, I know about the
extra food and clothes you give them.

1938
02:22:49.686 --> 02:22:51.438
Paid for out of your own pocket.

1939
02:22:51.521 --> 02:22:53.106
If we make a combined
approach, we could

1940
02:22:53.231 --> 02:22:54.816
get more than 4,000 out,
mine and yours.

1941
02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:55.901
Oskar...

1942
02:22:55.984 --> 02:22:59.446
We could relocate them in
something like safety, in moravia.

1943
02:23:00.197 --> 02:23:01.323
I don't know.

1944
02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:05.952
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1945
02:23:06.453 --> 02:23:07.496
Too many.

1946
02:23:07.579 --> 02:23:10.749
For every one... (Coughs)
You smoke, I smoke half.

1947
02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:14.753
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1948
02:23:14.836 --> 02:23:16.505
No, Oskar, I can't do any more.

1949
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:18.256
I will not accept that.

1950
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:31.228
How many? How many?

1951
02:23:31.353 --> 02:23:32.729
850, give or take.

1952
02:23:32.813 --> 02:23:36.191
Give or take what, stern?
Count them. How many?

1953
02:23:47.327 --> 02:23:50.288
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1954
02:23:55.585 --> 02:23:59.297
What did goeth say about this?

1955
02:23:59.381 --> 02:24:02.717
You just told him how many
people you needed and...

1956
02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:08.265
You're not buying them.

1957
02:24:11.351 --> 02:24:14.437
You're buying them? You're
paying him for each of these names?

1958
02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:15.939
If you were
still working for me,

1959
02:24:16.064 --> 02:24:17.482
I'd expect you to
talk me out of it.

1960
02:24:17.566 --> 02:24:19.401
It's costing me a fortune.

1961
02:24:21.778 --> 02:24:25.031
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1962
02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:48.597
You...

1963
02:24:55.312 --> 02:24:57.772
The list is an absolute good.

1964
02:24:59.733 --> 02:25:02.152
The list is life.

1965
02:25:04.196 --> 02:25:07.741
All around its
margins lies the Gulf.

1966
02:25:09.451 --> 02:25:11.453
Oskar,
there's a clerical error here

1967
02:25:11.578 --> 02:25:13.538
at the bottom of the last page.

1968
02:25:13.622 --> 02:25:16.041
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1969
02:25:16.124 --> 02:25:18.793
I'll never find a maid as
well trained as her at brinnlitz.

1970
02:25:18.877 --> 02:25:20.378
They are all country girls.

1971
02:25:34.684 --> 02:25:35.685
One hand of21.

1972
02:25:36.937 --> 02:25:39.731
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks. No.

1973
02:25:39.814 --> 02:25:42.651
Hit a natural, I
make it 14,800. No.

1974
02:25:43.735 --> 02:25:45.779
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1975
02:25:47.239 --> 02:25:48.599
I can't wager Helen
in a card game.

1976
02:25:48.698 --> 02:25:50.075
Why not?

1977
02:25:50.158 --> 02:25:51.326
Wouldn't be right.

1978
02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:53.221
She's just going to Auschwitz
number two, anyway.

1979
02:25:53.245 --> 02:25:55.181
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1980
02:25:55.205 --> 02:25:57.499
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her

1981
02:25:57.624 --> 02:25:59.918
to come back to Vienna with me.

1982
02:26:00.001 --> 02:26:02.963
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1983
02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:04.506
I want to grow old with her.

1984
02:26:04.631 --> 02:26:05.966
Are you mad?

1985
02:26:08.009 --> 02:26:11.096
Amon, you can't take
her to Vienna with you.

1986
02:26:11.513 --> 02:26:13.265
No, of course I can't.

1987
02:26:14.182 --> 02:26:16.059
That's what I'd like to do.

1988
02:26:16.977 --> 02:26:19.729
What I can do,
if I'm any sort of a man,

1989
02:26:19.854 --> 02:26:22.649
is the next most merciful thing.

1990
02:26:22.732 --> 02:26:25.110
I shall take her
into the woods and

1991
02:26:25.235 --> 02:26:27.654
shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

1992
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:40.709
What was it you
said for a natural 21?

1993
02:26:41.793 --> 02:26:44.379
Was it 14,800?

1994
02:26:44.546 --> 02:26:47.215
Schindlerjuden to these
tables! Say your names clearly.

1995
02:26:47.299 --> 02:26:49.759
We are the family dresner.

1996
02:26:49.884 --> 02:26:52.387
Juda, Jonas, donata, and chaja.

1997
02:26:54.139 --> 02:26:55.724
We are rosners. Henry, manci...

1998
02:26:55.890 --> 02:26:57.475
And Leo.

1999
02:26:57.892 --> 02:26:59.477
And our son. I am Olek.

2000
02:27:00.979 --> 02:27:02.230
Maria mischel.

2001
02:27:02.605 --> 02:27:04.107
Chaim nowak.

2002
02:27:05.608 --> 02:27:07.402
Wulkan, Markus.

2003
02:27:07.986 --> 02:27:09.487
Michael lemper.

2004
02:27:10.989 --> 02:27:12.824

2005
02:27:13.616 --> 02:27:15.827
Rebeka and Joseph bau.

2006

Altmann, eduard.

2018
02:27:48.276 --> 02:27:49.819
Grunberg, Miriam.

2019
02:27:50.278 --> 02:27:51.905

02:27:52.739 --> 02:27:53.990
Hilmann, eduard.

(Pencil scraping paper)

2025
02:28:04.125 --> 02:28:05.960
The worst is over.

2026
02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:10.507
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

2027
02:28:11.841 --> 02:28:16.137
Be careful. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

2028
02:28:16.805 --> 02:28:20.767
Watch your step. Men to this
transport and women to this transport.

2029
02:28:39.494 --> 02:28:41.996
(Train whistle blowing)

2030
02:28:42.831 --> 02:28:44.416
(People coughing)

2031
02:28:59.264 --> 02:29:03.184
Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.

2032
02:29:03.685 --> 02:29:06.855
You know how we
make ice into water?

2033
02:29:07.439 --> 02:29:09.441
(Blowing)

2034
02:29:09.524 --> 02:29:11.359
Olek, get another one!

2035
02:29:20.452 --> 02:29:22.370
(Train whistle blowing)

2036
02:29:23.163 --> 02:29:29.043
Zwittau-brinnlitz, czechoslovakia
Oskar schindler's hometown

2037
02:29:35.717 --> 02:29:37.469
(People coughing)

2038
02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:51.608
Man: Alle in einer
einzelreihe aufstellen!

2039
02:29:53.485 --> 02:29:55.236
You'll be pleased with the level

2040
02:29:55.403 --> 02:29:57.155
of efficiency I get
from these workers.

2041
02:29:59.657 --> 02:30:01.826
Budzyn, under my command,

2042
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:04.913
was the envy of every other
commandant in the labor camp system.

2043
02:30:05.079 --> 02:30:06.432
The prisoners, however...
Excuse me.

2044
02:30:06.456 --> 02:30:08.917
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

2045
02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:27.101
Schindler: The train with the
women has already left plaszow

2046
02:30:27.393 --> 02:30:29.896
and will be
arriving here very shortly.

2047
02:30:30.772 --> 02:30:33.274
I know you've
had a long journey.

2048
02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:36.528
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory,

2049
02:30:36.778 --> 02:30:40.448
where hot soup and
bread is waiting for you.

2050
02:30:42.575 --> 02:30:44.285
Welcome to brinnlitz!

2051
02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:48.957
(Train whistle blowing)

2052
02:30:54.295 --> 02:30:55.713
Mrs. Dresner: Beans in cholent?

2053
02:30:55.838 --> 02:30:57.298
Mila: Beans are the best part.

2054
02:30:57.507 --> 02:30:58.925
Danka: I don't like beans.

2055
02:30:59.968 --> 02:31:03.471
Beans and meat and
potatoes and bread.

2056
02:31:03.846 --> 02:31:06.057
That's not the way
you make cholent.

2057
02:31:10.478 --> 02:31:11.604
Eggs in cholent?

2058
02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:12.855
Yes!

2059
02:31:16.109 --> 02:31:17.269
Dan ka: I don't like cholent.

2060
02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:18.486
Mrs. Dresner: No, you don't.

2061
02:31:18.903 --> 02:31:19.988
What do you like?

2062
02:31:20.113 --> 02:31:21.197
I like caviar.

2063
02:31:24.033 --> 02:31:25.660
Rebeka: One day on the fire...

2064
02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.579
(Train whistle blowing)

2065
02:31:40.508 --> 02:31:45.471
Auschwitz

2066
02:32:30.725 --> 02:32:32.644
(Dogs barking and snarling)

2067
02:32:32.727 --> 02:32:34.771
Alle vorm wagen
in position bleiben.

2068
02:32:35.146 --> 02:32:38.983
Alle in der gruppe
zusammenbleiben.

2069
02:32:39.484 --> 02:32:41.110
Wegbleiben vom wagen!

2070
02:32:41.611 --> 02:32:43.738
Wegbleiben vom wagen!

2071
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:47.033
Wegbleiben vom wagen,
hab ich gesagt!

2072
02:32:50.912 --> 02:32:54.582
Schneller! Dalli, dalli, dalli!

2073
02:32:54.874 --> 02:32:57.710
Was ist da hinten los!

2074
02:32:58.544 --> 02:32:59.545
(Dog barking)

2075
02:33:00.421 --> 02:33:02.340
Soldier: Schnell!

2076
02:33:06.761 --> 02:33:09.347
Soldier: Los, raus mit euch.
Zack, Zack, Zack! Raus!

2077
02:33:10.765 --> 02:33:17.605
Dreibig, fl'infunddreibig,
vierzig, fl'infundvierzig.

2078
02:33:18.606 --> 02:33:20.942
Soldier: Aussteigen!

2079
02:33:32.203 --> 02:33:33.454
Where are the list makers?

2080
02:33:33.621 --> 02:33:34.914
Where are the tables?

2081
02:33:40.795 --> 02:33:42.338
Raus mit euch!

2082
02:33:43.631 --> 02:33:44.632
Hopp, hopp!

2083
02:33:44.716 --> 02:33:46.801
Bagaze w wagonach!

2084
02:33:47.719 --> 02:33:50.471
Dalli! Rausgehen! Schneller!

2085

Zostawcie bagaze w wagonach!

02:33:54.058 --> 02:33:55.393
Schneller!

2087
02:33:55.476 --> 02:33:57.729
Los, ein bisschen schneller!

2088
02:33:58.104 --> 02:33:59.856
Mama, where are we?

2089
02:34:03.985 --> 02:34:05.570
They're in Auschwitz.

2090
02:34:05.653 --> 02:34:08.322
The train was never routed
here. A paperwork mistake.

2091
02:34:15.872 --> 02:34:17.582
Polish woman: Szybciej! Szybko!

2092
02:34:17.665 --> 02:34:19.542
German woman: Die schuhe werfen!

2093

Szybko! Szybko!

2104
02:35:19.894 --> 02:35:21.270

Szybko! Szybko!

2108
02:35:34.033 --> 02:35:35.243
Tu wchodzic!

2109
02:35:53.761 --> 02:35:56.180
(Women screaming)

2110
02:36:00.768 --> 02:36:02.436
(Sobbing)

2111
02:36:08.276 --> 02:36:09.569
(Sobbing)

2112
02:36:10.695 --> 02:36:12.947
(Women wailing)

2113
02:36:29.714 --> 02:36:31.591
(Women screaming)

2114
02:36:36.137 --> 02:36:37.513
(Exclaims in surprise)

2115
02:36:55.656 --> 02:36:57.199
(Laughing)

2116
02:38:01.055 --> 02:38:02.264
Blick hinunter!

2117
02:38:05.726 --> 02:38:07.728
Die hand auf die schulter!

2118
02:38:08.646 --> 02:38:09.897
Man: How old are you, mother?

2119
02:38:10.064 --> 02:38:11.357
Woman: Sixty-eight.

2120
02:38:11.565 --> 02:38:12.650
Cough for me, mother.

2121
02:38:12.817 --> 02:38:16.570
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

2122
02:38:16.988 --> 02:38:20.032
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

2123
02:38:20.116 --> 02:38:22.868
If you do, you'll never know
what happened to you.

2124
02:38:25.955 --> 02:38:27.206
How old are you, mother?

2125
02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:28.582
Sixty-six, sir.

2126
02:38:28.666 --> 02:38:30.710
Sir? Good morning.

2127
02:38:30.793 --> 02:38:33.796
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.

2128
02:38:33.879 --> 02:38:37.299
We work for Oskar schindler.
We are schindler Jews.

2129
02:38:37.758 --> 02:38:39.427
Who is Oskar schindler?

2130
02:38:39.552 --> 02:38:41.178
He had a factory in krakow.

2131
02:38:41.262 --> 02:38:42.638
Enamelware.

2132
02:38:43.472 --> 02:38:45.057
A pot maker.

2133
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:47.810
How old are you, mother?

2134
02:38:52.648 --> 02:38:56.318
You are not the only
industrialist who needs labor,

2135
02:38:58.279 --> 02:38:59.447
herr schindler.

2136
02:39:00.948 --> 02:39:03.617
I remember earlier this year,
ig farben ordered

2137
02:39:03.701 --> 02:39:07.955
a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

2138
02:39:09.749 --> 02:39:12.460
The train came in
through the archway

2139
02:39:13.669 --> 02:39:17.506
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work

2140
02:39:19.467 --> 02:39:21.302
and sent 2,000 of them

2141
02:39:22.094 --> 02:39:24.263
straight away to
special treatment.

2142
02:39:26.474 --> 02:39:28.642
It is not my task
to interfere with

2143
02:39:28.809 --> 02:39:31.020
the processes that
take place down here.

2144
02:39:33.147 --> 02:39:37.610
Why do you think I can help
you if I can't help ig farben?

2145
02:39:38.319 --> 02:39:40.196
Allow me to express the reason.

2146
02:39:50.247 --> 02:39:52.750
I'm not making any
judgment about you.

2147
02:39:53.542 --> 02:39:56.295
It's just that I know
that in the coming months,

2148
02:39:56.378 --> 02:39:59.048
we're all going to
need portable wealth.

2149
02:40:02.718 --> 02:40:04.804
I could have you arrested.

2150
02:40:05.471 --> 02:40:09.266
I'm protected by powerful
friends. You should know that.

2151
02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:15.731
I do not say I
am accepting them.

2152
02:40:17.316 --> 02:40:20.444
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

2153
02:40:36.085 --> 02:40:38.337
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

2154
02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:41.298
I1lcutyou 300 units from it.

2155
02:40:41.715 --> 02:40:44.885
New ones. These are fresh.

2156
02:40:49.723 --> 02:40:51.684
The train comes,
we turn it around.

2157
02:40:51.767 --> 02:40:53.394
Mmm, yes, yes.

2158
02:40:53.477 --> 02:40:55.146
It's yours. I understand.

2159
02:40:55.563 --> 02:40:57.022
I want these.

2160
02:41:01.026 --> 02:41:03.112
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

2161
02:41:11.162 --> 02:41:14.373
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

2162
02:41:15.541 --> 02:41:19.461
Zoldinger, ernestina!
Waldergrun, hilda!

2163
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:21.505
Waldergrun, leonora!

2164
02:41:21.797 --> 02:41:25.301
Laast, Anna! Pfefferberg, Mila!

2165
02:41:25.426 --> 02:41:28.929
Dresner, chaja! Dresner, danka!

2166

Nussbaum, sidonia!
Rosner, manci!

2167
02:41:32.766 --> 02:41:38.022
Hirsch, Helen! Grosz, chaja
Sara! Seelenfreund, estella!

2168
02:41:38.105 --> 02:41:39.106
(Dogs barking)

2169
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:40.608
(Women shouting)

2170
02:41:53.537 --> 02:41:56.916
Woman soldier: Schneller
laufen! Schneller laufen! Schneller!

2171
02:41:57.166 --> 02:41:59.627
Schneller! Schneller!
Mach schon! Voran!

2172
02:42:01.045 --> 02:42:04.089
Los, iOS, los! Schneller!

2173
02:42:07.134 --> 02:42:10.304
Soldiers: Schneller!
Bewegt euch!

2174
02:42:11.597 --> 02:42:13.390
Bojcie sie! Bojcie sie!

2175
02:42:17.978 --> 02:42:18.979
(Screaming)

2176
02:42:19.104 --> 02:42:20.981
No! No! No!

2177
02:42:24.652 --> 02:42:28.489
Woman soldier: Madchen,
losjetzt aber! Jetzt aber tempo!

2178
02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:33.369
(Screaming)

2179
02:42:35.788 --> 02:42:38.290
(Shrieking)

2180
02:42:40.334 --> 02:42:43.921
Danka! Danka! Danka!

2181
02:42:44.004 --> 02:42:46.423
No! No! No!

2182
02:42:46.507 --> 02:42:48.801
(Screaming)

2183
02:42:48.884 --> 02:42:52.346
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

2184
02:42:52.763 --> 02:42:56.517
These are mine! These are my
workers! They should be on my train!

2185
02:42:57.518 --> 02:42:59.812
They're skilled munitions
workers! They're essential!

2186
02:43:00.688 --> 02:43:02.231
Essential girls!

2187
02:43:03.357 --> 02:43:04.358
(Shrieks)

2188
02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:09.405
Their fingers Polish the
insides of shell metal casings.

2189
02:43:10.030 --> 02:43:11.699
How else am I to
Polish the inside

2190
02:43:11.865 --> 02:43:13.534
of a 45 millimeter shell casing?

2191
02:43:13.701 --> 02:43:15.828
You tell me. You tell me!

2192
02:43:18.789 --> 02:43:22.209
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

2193
02:43:24.586 --> 02:43:27.548
(Train whistle blowing)

2194
02:45:17.408 --> 02:45:20.369
Under department "w" provisions

2195
02:45:21.537 --> 02:45:24.456
it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause.

2196
02:45:26.041 --> 02:45:28.544
Under the businesses
compensation fund

2197
02:45:29.169 --> 02:45:32.005
I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

2198
02:45:33.424 --> 02:45:35.676
If you shoot without thinking,

2199
02:45:36.635 --> 02:45:39.847
you go to prison, I get paid.

2200
02:45:41.014 --> 02:45:42.558
That's how it works.

2201
02:45:43.308 --> 02:45:47.020
So, there will be
no summary executions here.

2202
02:45:49.356 --> 02:45:52.526
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

2203
02:45:54.194 --> 02:45:56.488
In hopes of ensuring
that, guards will

2204
02:45:56.613 --> 02:45:58.866
no longer be allowed
on the factory floor

2205
02:45:59.366 --> 02:46:01.660
without my authorization.

2206
02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:10.627
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

2207
02:46:12.713 --> 02:46:14.423
Come on, come.

2208
02:46:15.549 --> 02:46:17.861
Soldier: Mensch, seit jahren
hab ich so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.

2209
02:46:17.885 --> 02:46:21.388
Schindler: Come on, boys,
come. Guck dir mal die buddeln an!

2210
02:46:21.763 --> 02:46:26.518
Priest: Et dimitte
nobis debita nostra...

2211
02:46:26.602 --> 02:46:30.314
Sicut et nos dimittimus...

2212
02:46:30.397 --> 02:46:35.444
Congregation:
Quotidianum da nobis hodie...

2213
02:46:35.527 --> 02:46:39.907
Et dimitte nobis
debita nostra...

2214
02:46:40.282 --> 02:46:43.494
Sicut et nos dimittimus...

2215
02:46:43.577 --> 02:46:46.747
Debitoribus nostris...

2216
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:51.210
No doorman or mattre d'
will ever mistake you again.

2217
02:46:52.836 --> 02:46:54.004
I promise.

2218
02:46:54.087 --> 02:46:56.924
Sed libera nos a malo

2219
02:46:59.092 --> 02:47:00.511
Itzhak.

2220
02:47:01.929 --> 02:47:03.729
This is Itzhak stern,
my accountant. Itzhak...

2221
02:47:03.764 --> 02:47:05.432
You must be Mrs. Schindler.

2222
02:47:05.599 --> 02:47:06.892
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2223
02:47:07.017 --> 02:47:08.411
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

2224
02:47:08.435 --> 02:47:10.145
Very generous of you. I know.

2225
02:47:10.229 --> 02:47:12.606
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

2226
02:47:13.148 --> 02:47:15.585
This is my wife, stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.

2227
02:47:15.609 --> 02:47:18.362
Oskar, please, attend to
business. It's much more attractive.

2228
02:47:18.737 --> 02:47:19.821
Madam. Hello.

2229
02:47:19.905 --> 02:47:21.665
What is it? We've
received an angry complaint

2230
02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:23.450
from the armaments board.

2231
02:47:23.534 --> 02:47:25.661
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,

2232
02:47:25.744 --> 02:47:28.288
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

2233
02:47:28.413 --> 02:47:30.457
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.

2234
02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:32.709
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

2235
02:47:32.834 --> 02:47:34.729
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.

2236
02:47:34.753 --> 02:47:36.588
Sure, so would I, so would you.

2237
02:47:36.672 --> 02:47:39.067
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.

2238
02:47:39.091 --> 02:47:42.886
There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

2239
02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:46.640
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

2240
02:47:49.476 --> 02:47:51.645
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

2241
02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:52.729
Pass them off as ours.

2242
02:47:52.854 --> 02:47:53.934
I don't see the difference.

2243
02:47:53.981 --> 02:47:55.124
Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...

2244
02:47:55.148 --> 02:47:56.793
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

2245
02:47:56.817 --> 02:47:57.835
You'll lose a lot of money.

2246
02:47:57.859 --> 02:47:59.653
Fewer shells will be made.

2247
02:47:59.736 --> 02:48:01.530
Stern, if this factory
ever produces

2248
02:48:01.655 --> 02:48:03.490
a shell that can
actually be fired,

2249
02:48:03.574 --> 02:48:05.033
I'll be very unhappy.

2250
02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:08.954
Woman: Hello, madam.
How do you do?

2251
02:48:19.923 --> 02:48:21.174
(Machine grinding)

2252
02:48:23.594 --> 02:48:26.471
How are you doing, rabbi? Rabbi!

2253
02:48:30.142 --> 02:48:32.019
Good, herr direktor.

2254
02:48:33.979 --> 02:48:35.439
Sun's going down.

2255
02:48:38.525 --> 02:48:39.985
Yes, it is.

2256
02:48:41.862 --> 02:48:45.574
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

2257
02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:46.867
Is it?

2258
02:48:51.455 --> 02:48:55.167
What's the matter with you? You
should be preparing for the sabbath.

2259
02:48:56.376 --> 02:48:57.753
Shouldn't you?

2260
02:49:05.427 --> 02:49:09.222
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

2261
02:49:13.477 --> 02:49:17.189

2273
02:50:07.197 --> 02:50:08.424
for the seven months
it was fully operational,

2274
02:50:08.448 --> 02:50:10.283
schindler's brinnlitz
munitions factory

2275
02:50:10.367 --> 02:50:11.427
was a model of non-production.

2276
02:50:11.451 --> 02:50:13.054
During this same period,
he spent millions of reichmarks

2277
02:50:13.078 --> 02:50:14.078
gut shabbos.

2278
02:50:14.121 --> 02:50:16.373
(Workers respond) Gut shabbos.

2279
02:50:16.456 --> 02:50:18.376
To sustain his workers
and bribe reich officials.

2280
02:50:25.006 --> 02:50:26.341
Schindler: What?

2281
02:50:28.218 --> 02:50:33.223
Do you have any money
hidden away some place

2282
02:50:33.306 --> 02:50:34.891
that I don't know about?

2283
02:50:46.278 --> 02:50:47.904
Why? Am I broke?

2284
02:50:53.201 --> 02:50:54.494
Well...

2285
02:50:56.496 --> 02:51:01.501
Winston Churchill on
radio: Yesterday morning, at 2:41 am,

2286
02:51:02.836 --> 02:51:05.756
at general eisenhower's
headquarters,

2287
02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:12.846
general jodl signed the act
of unconditional surrender

2288
02:51:14.055 --> 02:51:18.935
of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe

2289
02:51:19.978 --> 02:51:22.522
to the allied
expeditionary force

2290
02:51:23.857 --> 02:51:27.944
and simultaneously
to the Soviet high command.

2291
02:51:28.737 --> 02:51:31.323
The German waris,
therefore, at an end.

2292
02:51:31.406 --> 02:51:32.532
(Footsteps approaching)

2293
02:51:32.657 --> 02:51:34.677
(Knocking at door) But
let us not forget for a moment...

2294
02:51:34.701 --> 02:51:37.746
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

2295
02:51:39.372 --> 02:51:41.208
Japan, with all her treachery...

2296
02:51:42.375 --> 02:51:46.213
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

2297
02:51:48.048 --> 02:51:51.843
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

2298
02:51:54.721 --> 02:51:56.973
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process

2299
02:51:57.098 --> 02:51:59.392
of looking for survivors
of your families.

2300
02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:04.689
In most cases,

2301
02:52:06.733 --> 02:52:08.568
you won't find them.

2302
02:52:09.903 --> 02:52:12.113
After six long years of murder,

2303
02:52:12.823 --> 02:52:15.784
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

2304
02:52:18.245 --> 02:52:19.788
We've survived.

2305
02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.584
Many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.

2306
02:52:27.712 --> 02:52:29.381
Thank yourselves.

2307
02:52:31.258 --> 02:52:33.301
Thank your fearless stern

2308
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:36.429
and others among you
who worried about you

2309
02:52:36.555 --> 02:52:38.932
and faced death at every moment.

2310
02:52:43.645 --> 02:52:45.981
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

2311
02:52:46.648 --> 02:52:48.900
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

2312
02:52:49.693 --> 02:52:51.778
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.

2313
02:52:52.445 --> 02:52:54.364
I am a criminal.

2314
02:52:56.324 --> 02:52:59.452
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

2315
02:53:01.872 --> 02:53:05.375
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight,

2316
02:53:05.458 --> 02:53:08.628
after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

2317
02:53:08.712 --> 02:53:10.255
I have to flee.

2318
02:53:13.717 --> 02:53:16.970
I know you have received
orders from our commandant,

2319
02:53:17.512 --> 02:53:19.639
which he has received
from his superiors,

2320
02:53:19.806 --> 02:53:21.933
to dispose of the population
of this camp.

2321
02:53:23.018 --> 02:53:25.228
Now would be the time to do it.

2322
02:53:25.312 --> 02:53:29.941
Here they are, they're all
here. This is your opportunity.

2323
02:53:30.025 --> 02:53:31.985
(People murmuring)

2324
02:53:35.155 --> 02:53:36.823
Or you could leave

2325
02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:41.536
and return to
your families as men

2326
02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:43.455
instead of murderers.

2327
02:54:25.872 --> 02:54:29.376
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,

2328
02:54:29.709 --> 02:54:32.712
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

2329

Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2344
02:55:32.022 --> 02:55:33.106
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2345
02:55:33.273 --> 02:55:34.357
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2346
02:55:34.524 --> 02:55:35.608
Stern: Open wide.

2347
02:55:38.111 --> 02:55:39.612
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2348
02:55:58.631 --> 02:56:00.425
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

2349
02:56:25.492 --> 02:56:28.203
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

2350
02:56:29.913 --> 02:56:32.624
I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

2351
02:56:33.666 --> 02:56:35.794
Two and a half meters each.

2352
02:56:36.419 --> 02:56:39.089
Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

2353
02:56:39.798 --> 02:56:41.966
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

2354
02:56:42.717 --> 02:56:45.845
Likewise those egipshi
cigarettes we organized.

2355
02:56:46.346 --> 02:56:48.848
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

2356
02:57:09.702 --> 02:57:12.664
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things

2357
02:57:14.207 --> 02:57:15.375
in case you are captured.

2358
02:57:18.461 --> 02:57:20.588
Every worker has signed it.

2359
02:57:31.724 --> 02:57:33.143
Thank you.

2360
02:58:00.795 --> 02:58:02.797
It is Hebrew, from the talmud.

2361
02:58:02.881 --> 02:58:06.384
It says, "whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire."

2362
02:58:14.267 --> 02:58:15.643
(Ring clattering)

2363
02:58:47.634 --> 02:58:49.552
I could have got more out.

2364
02:58:52.639 --> 02:58:54.807
I could have got more.
I don't know.

2365
02:58:55.141 --> 02:58:56.392
If I just...

2366
02:58:58.645 --> 02:58:59.687
I could have got more.

2367
02:58:59.771 --> 02:59:04.067
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who
are alive because of you. Look at them.

2368
02:59:05.693 --> 02:59:07.654
If I'd made more money.

2369
02:59:08.238 --> 02:59:09.447
(Laughs)

2370
02:59:11.991 --> 02:59:15.203
I threw away so much money.

2371
02:59:17.872 --> 02:59:20.458
(Sobbing) You have no idea.

It! Had just...

2373
02:59:23.294 --> 02:59:26.172
There will be generations
because of what you did.

2374
02:59:28.508 --> 02:59:30.260
I didn't do enough.

2375
02:59:31.177 --> 02:59:32.762
You did so much.

2376
02:59:37.141 --> 02:59:38.434
This car.

2377
02:59:39.894 --> 02:59:42.021
Goeth would've bought this car.

2378
02:59:42.105 --> 02:59:45.608
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

2379
02:59:49.404 --> 02:59:50.989
Ten people.

2380
02:59:53.032 --> 02:59:54.659
Ten more people.

2381
02:59:57.453 --> 02:59:59.038
This pin...

2382
02:59:59.163 --> 03:00:00.581
Two people.

2383
03:00:03.668 --> 03:00:05.128
This is gold.

2384
03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:07.255
Two more people.

2385
03:00:07.547 --> 03:00:10.550
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

2386
03:00:10.675 --> 03:00:12.719
He would have
given me one, one more.

2387
03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.807
One more person.

2388
03:00:20.435 --> 03:00:22.061
A person, stern.

2389
03:00:24.355 --> 03:00:25.690
For this.

2390
03:00:28.401 --> 03:00:31.446
(Sobbing) I could have gotten

2391
03:00:32.196 --> 03:00:35.658
one more person, and I didn't.

2392
03:00:37.243 --> 03:00:38.953
And I didn't!

2393
03:00:39.162 --> 03:00:40.913
(Loud sobbing)

2394
03:02:09.585 --> 03:02:11.796
You have been liberated

2395
03:02:12.255 --> 03:02:14.257
by the Soviet army!

2396
03:02:22.890 --> 03:02:24.559
Have you been in Poland?

2397
03:02:24.725 --> 03:02:25.977
I just came from Poland.

2398
03:02:29.439 --> 03:02:31.190
Are there any Jews left?

2399
03:02:37.321 --> 03:02:38.823
Where should we go?

2400
03:02:39.699 --> 03:02:42.076
Russian officer:
Don't go east, that's for sure.

2401
03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:43.744
They hate you there.

2402
03:02:45.538 --> 03:02:47.748
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

2403
03:02:50.376 --> 03:02:52.336
We could use some food.

2404
03:02:55.047 --> 03:02:57.383
Isn't there a town over there?
