00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.201
Where's Bailey?

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.956
Deaf and dumb, eh?

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.471
Can you read lips?

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.599
Where is Bailey?

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.686
Coming back today?

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.107
Come on.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.804
- Hello, Marny.
- Well, look who is back.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.556
- Did you dye your hair?
- Why?

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.349
I keep thinking of you as a blond.

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.477
For all the thinking you do about me,
I could be bald-headed.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.272
Ham on rye. Did you miss me, honey?

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.316
If I didn't, I can't think
of anybody else who did.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.820
- One thing's sure, Bailey don't miss nothing.
- Neither do you.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.864
She's your girl,
and he ain't my man.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.825
So it's no skin off my nose.
I just see what I see.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.743
You sure you don't see what you hear?

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:26.122
Nothing can happen in this town
that I don't hear about it.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.792
I'm just saying what I see.
Every day they go fishing together.

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:31.502
Look, the sandwich.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:36.215
Two things I can smell inside 100 feet:
burning hamburger and a romance.

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.426
You got a customer.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.969
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.306
- Nothing else?
- Cream.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.017
- Where you been this time?
- L.A.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.894
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.521
First she's got you,
now she's got you and Bailey.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.482
And the only thing I seem to get is older.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.152
Thanks a lot, Marny.
I'll see you later.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.491
Hmm. I guess I must have said something.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.951
You talked enough.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.538
Everything people ought to know
they just don't want to hear.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.498
That's the trouble with the world.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.668
Either that or you're on the wrong
side of the counter.

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.130
- Tell me something.
- You don't look as though I could.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.550
That, uh, Bailey who burns you up,
he run the gas station?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.845
- Do you know him?
- I might have once.

00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:26.140
If he keeps mooning around Jim's girl,
nobody'll know him...

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.601
...and that'd be too bad.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.230
You, uh, see much of this Bailey?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.233
Yeah, every day from here.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.318
I often wondered what happened to him...

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:42.031
...then one day I'm breezing through here,
and there's his name up on a sign.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:47.036
- It's a small world.
- Yeah, or a big sign.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:08.099
- They're just not feeding today.
- They will later. It's clouding up.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.852
They say the day you die,
your name is written on a cloud.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.021
- Who says?
- They.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.232
Never heard of them.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.485
Nothing in that one but rain.
Think we ought to go home?

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:20.903
Yes.

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.656
- Do you want to?
- No.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:29.829
Every time I look at the sky,
I think of all the places I've never been.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.499
Yes, and every time you look up,
they're all the same.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.628
- You've been a lot of places, haven't you?
- One too many.

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.923
- Which did you like best?
- This one right here.

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.885
- I bet you say that to all the places.
- You see that cove over there?

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.929
I'd like to build a house right there...

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.433
...marry you, live in it
and never go anywhere else.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.686
I wish you would.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.988
You were never married before, were you?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.282
Not that I can remember.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.200
That's good.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.329
You'd be amazed the way
people talk about you.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.832
The mysterious Jeff Bailey.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.378
My mother tells me that I've only
known you for such a short time.

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:21.964
And where'd you come from?
And what did you do?

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:26.802
My father was...

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.940
- We'd better go.
- Is something the matter?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.901
Maybe not.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.823
Here.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.830
You sure are a secret man.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.834
Thanks.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.754
Oh, a man just wants to see me.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.381
Oh.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:27.405
- A long time.
- Hello, Joe. I wish it was nicer to see you.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.741
Everyone sure missed you, Jeff,
but not as much as I have.

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.910
- How's that?
- Whit used to look at me...

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.288
...shake his head,
and wish I had brains like you.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.292
- What's the other reason?
- I had to find you.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.420
- I owe you something?
- Not me.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.296
Who?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:48.008
- How far can that kid read lips?
- I don't know. I'll ask him some time.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.010
This far?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.848
- You don't like to make mistakes, do you?
- They don't let me have many.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.308
All right, come on inside.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.568
- Funny racket to find you in, Jeff.
- Yeah, me and the kid laugh all the time.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.279
Heh. I guess that's because it's respectable.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.323
That hash slinger across
the street says you are too.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:15.077
- How did you happen to find me, Joe?
- I was driving down the road one day...

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:20.249
...and who do I see pumping gasoline
but my old chum from the old times.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:22.585
Of course, there's a different
name on the sign.

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.337
- So you just dropped in?
- Why not?

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.466
Okay, then I'm glad to see an old pal too.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:32.428
So I take you to dinner, buy you
drinks, it gets late chewing the fat...

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.847
...you hop in your car
and you're gone. Right?

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.766
- Almost.
- What else?

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.060
I'm still working for that guy, Jeff.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.354
- Whit?
- He'd like to see you.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.065
- As much as you did?
- Heh.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.152
- Worse.
- I see.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.529
No one ever thought more of you than Whit.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.989
Or more about me.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:55.576
Well, that could be too.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.039
- All right, what's he want, Joe?
- Maybe he's got something nice for you.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.832
- Try once more.
- Heh.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.377
Look, Whit never steered
you into anything bad, did he?

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.131
Why, he never even squawked when
you blew the best thing he ever gave you.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:13.302
- Go on.
- The guy just wants to see you.

00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:15.387
Well, you put it that way, what can I do?

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.224
You know of any other way to put it?

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.771
- Say tomorrow morning?
- Where?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.485
Lake Tahoe. Turn right at Emerald Bay.
Big house on a hill. You won't miss it.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.655
You can't.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.346
Ann? John, are you letting her out like this?

00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:02.351
Are you gonna stand for it, with a man
who won't even come to the door?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.939
Don't worry about them.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.526
- Darling.
- It's no good, is it?

00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:15.155
- It doesn't matter. It's just that they...
- Oh, honey, I know how they feel.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.950
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:22.079
- Then don't look so grim.
- No, it's something else.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.332
- What?
- That guy that showed up today...

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.459
Yes?

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.545
You want to ride with me
up to Lake Tahoe?

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.755
- Now?
- Yes, now.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.340
I want to tell you something.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.467
All right, Jeff.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.429
You told me once
I'd have to tell you sometime.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.390
Well, this is it.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:01.577
Now, the first thing I wanna get off my
chest: My name isn't Bailey, it's Markham.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:06.206
- Markham. Jeff Markham?
- I should have told you before.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.835
I meant to, but I kept putting it off...

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.630
...because I didn't like any part of it.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.924
- Please tell me, Jeff.
- Some of it's gonna hurt you.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.344
It doesn't matter.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.972
Well, our friend Markham
lived in New York.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:26.685
He worked with a sort of stupid,
oily gent by the name of Jack Fisher.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.105
We called ourselves detectives.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:33.734
That was about three years ago,
maybe more.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:38.447
Wintertime. One of the coldest days
I remember in the town.

00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:40.783
And we got a call to come and see a big op.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:44.578
- A what?
- An operator, gambler.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:48.499
He didn't come to see us because he was
too high-powered a character.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:52.961
Also, because some dame had taken
four shots at him with his own.38.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.464
Made one of them good.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.971
He was taking it in stride,
but he had a friend who was a ball of fire.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:07.059
Newspaper guys, wise guys,
who do they think they're kidding?

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.478
So he shot himself
cleaning a cap pistol.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.898
So I shot the ace of spades
out of a sleeve during a gin game.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.900
A guy can't even get shot by a dame...

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.028
...without the whole town
starting to buzz like a...

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:22.157
Like you? Smoke a cigarette, Joe.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:28.956
You just sit and stay inside yourself.
You wait for me to talk. I like that.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.999
I never found out much
listening to myself.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.337
Hmm.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.050
- It amazes me how she missed so often.
- Maybe you were moving.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.803
A dame with a rod is like a guy
with a knitting needle.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.682
- What's he doing here? I called you.
- My partner.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.813
- Should I ask why you didn't call the law?
- Should you?

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.941
Heh. I guess not.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.444
- Anything happen to her?
- She ran out on me.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.946
- With 40,000 bucks.
- I want her back.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.614
Or the money?

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.580
You know, I once bet $40,000 on a horse
that ran dead last, so I bought the horse.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.498
Yeah, that's what I mean.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:16.086
Oh, you're wrong. I put that horse
in a nice green pasture...

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.881
...so he'd never get his foot
caught in a mutuel machine.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.341
You should go out and visit it sometime.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:28.474
No, I just want her back.
When you see her, you'll understand better.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.976
Maybe she's just an impulsive girl.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.024
- Shall we let it go at that?
- I can let it all go.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:42.654
An even 5000 now
and 5 when you bring her back.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.948
And expenses.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.826
Now, that should have been
the first thing you said.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.497
- Find her, Jeff. Bring her back.
- Why me?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:57.753
Well, I know a lot of smart guys
and a few honest ones, and you're both.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.801
What happens to her?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.469
I won't touch her.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.476
Okay.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.314
Get me the stuff on her family,
pictures, anything interesting.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.399
- You'll get it.
- I'll see you.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.986
You bring it over, Joe.
Come on, let's go.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:27.991
Oh, by the way, you mind
telling me her name?

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:33.831
- Kathie Moffat.
- Thanks.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:41.171
She must be quite a dame.
A wild goose with 40 G's.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.633
You know, for a smart guy, that Sterling
sure trusts you, don't he?

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.134
Why not?

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.136
- Am I going along?
- No.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:52.474
Oh, he doesn't like my personality, huh?
Well, I'm still in, Jeff, fifty-fifty.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.686
- Did I say anything different?
- All right. It's a good soft touch.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:59.523
Don't get hot at me.
And don't get any cute ideas.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.793
These are on me.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:23.964
This is an old friend of mine, Jeff Markham.
He wants to ask you something.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.676
- Which one of you is Eunice Leonard?
- Me.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.637
May I ask you a few questions?

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.643
Come on, honey, let's dance.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:42.065
You work for Katherine Moffat?

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.985
Not anymore, she's gone.
She got pushed around.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.238
I wouldn't have stayed myself,
only she got sick being vaccinated.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.866
- How come you're asking?
- I want to find her.

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:54.870
- You want to find her for that man?
- No, for myself. Where'd she go?

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.665
- Maybe I oughtn't to tell nothing.
- More harm might come to her if you didn't.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:02.461
- Is she in harm now?
- I don't know, she disappeared.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.131
- Maybe you better say, honey.
- Well, I can't say much.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.800
It wasn't no cold place though.
That girl hated snow.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.179
Them clothes she took,
she was looking for sun. Florida.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:16.433
- You sure about that?
- Now I seem to remember, and I'm sure.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.853
- No trunk?
- She only took suitcases.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:23.023
- You're sure again?
- I know, I weighed them for her.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.817
- How much did they weigh?
- 131 pounds.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.319
- Exactly?
- Exactly.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:30.989
- On account of that's what I weigh myself.
- Thanks.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.325
Bring them another round.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.956
You don't get vaccinated for Florida,
but you do for Mexico.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:43.168
So I just followed that 90 pounds
of excess baggage to Mexico City.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.379
She had been at the Reforma
and then gone.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.798
I took the bus south like she did.

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:51.885
It was hot in Taxco.
You say to yourself, "How hot can it get?"

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.471
And then in Acapulco, you find out.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:55.931
She had to wind up here...

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.017
...because if you wanna go south,
here's where you get the boat.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.978
All I had to do was wait.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:05.816
Near the plaza was a little café
called La Mar Azul next to a movie house.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:10.445
I sat there in the afternoons and drank beer.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.824
I used to sit there half-asleep
with a beer and the darkness...

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:18.120
...only that music from the movie
next door kept jarring me awake.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.957
And then I saw her
coming out of the sun...

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.627
...and I knew why Whit didn't
care about that 40 grand.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:26.795
Cuba Libre, please.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:51.820
Señorita, señor, may I speak some words?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.283
- You will be seated, señor, huh? Yes?
- With pleasure, señor.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:02.039
I am José Rodriguez, a guide,
a most excellent guide.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.291
- Indeed?
- You ask them.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.128
They can tell you that José Rodriguez
knows Acapulco as no one else.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.547
- Each little street...
- I don't want a guide.

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:14.384
- A very difficult girl.
- Heh. Is there one not so, señor?

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.928
- Perhaps a lottery ticket?
- No.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:21.516
I have here, wrought
by skilled hands, a ring...

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:25.187
...and earrings of jade and pure silver.

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.314
These.

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:37.032
- I never wear them.
- Nor I. Please.

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.242
No, thank you.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:42.120
My name is Jeff Markham,
and I haven't talked to anybody...

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.748
...who hasn't tried to sell me
something for 10 days.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.961
If I don't talk, I think. It's too late
in life for me to start thinking.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.508
I could go down to the cliff and look
at the sea like a good tourist.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:58.637
But it's no good if there isn't somebody
you can turn to and say, "Nice view, huh?"

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.390
It's the same with the churches,
the relics, the moonlight or a Cuba Libre.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.227
Nothing in the world is any good
unless you can share it.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.937
Maybe you ought to go home.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.899
- Maybe that's why I'm here.
- Is it?

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:15.529
Well, there's always José Rodriguez.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:19.199
If it gets too lonely, there's a cantina
down the street called Pablo's.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.954
It's nice and quiet. The man there
plays American music for a dollar.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:28.500
Sip bourbon and shut your eyes.
It's like a little place on 56th Street.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.794
I'll wear my earrings.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.965
I sometimes go there.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.855
I went to send a wire to Whit
that I'd found her...

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:53.233
...but the telegraph office
was closed for the siesta.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.027
I was glad it was,
and I suddenly knew why.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.329
I went to Pablo's that night.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.707
I knew I'd go every night
until she showed up...

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.375
...and I knew she knew it.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.629
I sat there and drank bourbon,
and I shut my eyes...

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:17.716
...but I didn't think
of a joint on 56th Street.

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:23.180
I knew where I was and what I was doing.
I just thought what a sucker I was.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:26.266
I even knew she wouldn't
come the first night...

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.854
...but I sat there, grinding it out.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:41.072
But the next night I knew she'd show.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.825
She waited until it was late...

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:48.788
...and then she walked in
out of the moonlight, smiling.

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:12.479
- Well, this is a coincidence.
- Yes, it is.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:16.858
- American music.
- You know, I've been here for two nights.

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.195
- Thinking?
- No, just waiting.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:22.197
I haven't been lonely.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.991
- Bourbon?
- As you suggested.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.327
Thank you, sir.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.579
I've been sitting here for three hours.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:33.458
I thought the guy was gonna
break out with "Melancholy Baby."

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.836
You know, you're a curious man.

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.798
You're gonna make every guy
you meet a little bit curious.

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:43.385
That's not what I mean.
You don't ask questions.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:46.429
You don't even ask me what my name is.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.140
All right, what's your name?

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.518
Kathie.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:55.480
- I like it.
- Or where I come from.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.857
I'm thinking about where we're going.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:01.444
- Don't you like it in here?
- I'm just not ready to settle down.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.071
Shall I take you somewhere else?

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.573
You're gonna find it very easy
to take me anywhere.

00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:10.412
You know, I'm a much better guide
than José Rodriguez. Wanna try me?

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.964
- That isn't the way to play.
- Why not?

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.383
- Because it isn't the way to win.
- Is there a way?

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:26.386
There's a way to lose more slowly.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.349
- I prefer it like that.
- Chunk it in.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:35.478
- Don't you like to gamble?
- Not against a wheel.

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:40.984
- Tell me why you're so hard to please.
- Take me where I can tell you.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.610
All right, come on.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.335
Wait a minute.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.080
When are you taking me back?

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:40.585
- Is that why you kissed me?
- No.

00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:44.047
Whit didn't die.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.799
- He didn't?
- No.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.843
- Then why...
- He just wants you back.

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:52.764
I hate him.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:57.143
- I'm sorry he didn't die.
- Give him time.

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:02.899
- You are taking me back.
- There's no hurry.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:05.985
I could have run away last night.

00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:10.490
- I'd find you.
- Yes, I believe you would.

00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:14.828
Are you glad you did?

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.455
I don't know.

00:24:18.374 --> 00:24:20.417
I am.

00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:24.754
- There was a little business about $40,000.
- I didn't take it.

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.549
How'd you know it was taken?

00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:30.301
It's what you meant.

00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:33.888
I don't want anything of his
or any part of him.

00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:37.642
- Except his life.
- I didn't know what I was doing.

00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:41.187
I didn't know anything,
except how much I hated him.

00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:44.691
But I didn't take anything.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.402
I didn't, Jeff.

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.239
Won't you believe me?

00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:54.242
Baby, I don't care.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.794
I never saw her in the daytime.
We seemed to live by night.

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:08.756
What was left of the day went away
like a pack of cigarettes you smoked.

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:11.509
I didn't know where she lived.
I never followed her.

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:15.346
All I ever had to go on
was a place and time to see her again.

00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:19.017
I don't know what we were waiting for.
Maybe we thought the world would end.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.810
Maybe we thought it was a dream...

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.396
...and we'd wake up
with a hangover in Niagara Falls.

00:25:23.606 --> 00:25:25.815
I wired Whit, but I didn't tell him.

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:28.735
"I'm in Acapulco," I said,
"I wish you were here."

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:32.030
And every night I went to meet her.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.366
How did I know she'd ever
show up? I didn't.

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:39.787
What stopped her from taking
a boat to Chile or Guatemala? Nothing.

00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:44.667
How big a chump can you get to be?
I was finding out.

00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:49.339
And then she'd come along
like school was out...

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:53.343
...and everything else was just
a stone you sailed at the sea.

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.304
- I didn't know you were so little.
- I'm taller than Napoleon.

00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:58.640
You're prettier too.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:03.853
- Did you miss me?
- No more than I would my eyes.

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:08.566
- Where should we go tonight?
- Let's go to my place.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.157
It was the first time she had
mentioned her place or going there.

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:20.995
Maybe she'd decided something, or it
was because the sky looked full of rain.

00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:39.722
It was a nice little joint with bamboo
furniture and Mexican gimcracks.

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.600
One little lamp burned. It was all right.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.813
And the rain hammering like that
on the window made it good to be in there.

00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:48.856
Here.

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:53.278
Hey, hey, not so hard.

00:26:58.284 --> 00:26:59.951
- Now yours.
- No, Joe, it's all right.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.453
- Oh, come on.
- No, not so hard, Jeff. My earring.

00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:06.124
Hush! I'm trying to dry your hair.

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:30.982
- Are you going with me?
- Where?

00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:33.818
- Wherever it takes us.
- Why?

00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:39.240
To make a life for ourselves,
to get away from Whit. He knows I'm here.

00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:43.828
- When?
- Tomorrow.

00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:48.291
Pack in the morning, meet me
at the hotel if you can make it.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.253
- I can make it. Can we get away with it?
- Let's find out.

00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:55.798
- You don't know Whit. He won't forget.
- Everybody forgets.

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.216
Not Whit.

00:27:57.426 --> 00:28:00.637
So we'll send him a postcard
every Christmas.

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.556
Jeff, I'm glad you're not afraid of him.

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:06.351
I've been afraid of half the things I ever did.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.481
- And this time?
- I'm only afraid you might not go.

00:28:12.608 --> 00:28:14.942
Don't be.

00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:17.820
I'll be there tomorrow.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.990
- Love me?
- Mm-hm.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.826
- Poco?
- What's that?

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:27.288
- A little.
- Mucho.

00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:53.940
- Well, the last guy in the world.
- I hate surprises myself.

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:57.902
- You wanna just shut the door and forget it?
- No, no. Come on in.

00:28:59.363 --> 00:29:02.240
I like surprises. When I was a kid,
we were so busted...

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:05.660
...that if we got anything at all
for Christmas it was a big surprise.

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:08.371
- Sit down, have a chair.
- Thanks.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.998
- Been here long?
- Oh...

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.335
- How long, Joe?
- Hardly at all.

00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:19.465
I just wondered who might
be following whom.

00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:22.135
What makes you think that?

00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:26.013
Look, I know how you trust people. About
as far as you can throw Stephanos here.

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:30.476
And that's all right with me,
only let's not get so cute about it.

00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:35.481
I'm on my way to Mexico City,
see a man about a horse.

00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:40.903
On the level.
A racehorse from South America.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.950
- Checking out?
- Sure. Why waste your money?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.329
- Did you find her?
- No, only her trail.

00:29:50.873 --> 00:29:56.544
Not quite as hot as a prairie fire, but there.
Sometimes a little too obvious.

00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:01.048
She's a clever little girl.

00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:04.469
- Is she?
- Wouldn't you say so?

00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:07.430
You should have told me,
I would have played it differently.

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.308
Maybe she wouldn't have
heard my shoes squeaking.

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:15.480
Always a hop, skip and a jump ahead of me.
Mexico City to Taxco to here.

00:30:15.689 --> 00:30:20.234
- And here, Jeff, did you see her?
- No. I wish I had.

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:23.196
I don't like playing games
when I'm the fall guy.

00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:24.572
You might remember that, Whit.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.086
Thank you.

00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:50.723
- Nice shoes. Sporty for you, aren't they?
- Yeah, I got them down here.

00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:53.851
As I said before, I thought
maybe the others squeaked.

00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:58.314
Let's go down to the bar. You can cool off
while we try to impress each other.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.526
Fine.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.492
Nice place. I'd like to stay here
a while myself.

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.161
You did, by proxy.

00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:24.924
Something tall and cool,
I don't care what.

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.467
- Two.
- Make it three.

00:31:26.677 --> 00:31:28.511
Certainly, sir.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.681
- So you blew it.
- Anybody can have bad luck.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.518
- And squeaky shoes.
- Think of a number, Joe.

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:39.897
- Where were you off to?
- The telegraph office to wire you.

00:31:40.107 --> 00:31:43.276
I told you, I don't like
to spend your money.

00:31:44.194 --> 00:31:48.114
- I can stand it.
- Well, it's your business.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.577
Whit, my friend, there's a million dames
in this world, and they all look like her.

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:55.204
No, they don't.

00:31:56.707 --> 00:31:58.332
So she was here.

00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:01.794
Well, according to all
available evidence, she was.

00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:04.422
Maybe I should've sent Stephanos.

00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.675
- Could you find one dame in a million, Joe?
- A one with 40 grand.

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:15.933
Sorry.

00:32:16.143 --> 00:32:17.310
You picked up some nerves.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:20.396
I don't need a crack like that
any more than I need your dough.

00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:25.610
That's what I've been telling you. I missed
her. The dame caught a boat south.

00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.905
- Where?
- Look, I got along before this job.

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:33.075
I ate good, and I grew as big as you did.
If there's something you don't like, say so.

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:37.413
- I just asked where.
- Chile. Guatemala.

00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:41.417
You wanna go see the guy in the steamship
company? You wanna talk to him right now?

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:43.628
Why not?

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.932
- Taxi, sir?
- Yeah.

00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:59.769
I'm sorry.
You missed her and you feel bad.

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.479
I shouldn't have joked about it.

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:03.314
All right, then I won't either.

00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:06.817
You get your 5 grand back
and Stephanos can take over from here.

00:33:07.027 --> 00:33:08.569
You're wrong.

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:11.489
I fire people, but nobody quits me.

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:14.075
You started this and you'll end it.

00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:17.787
Besides, Joe couldn't find
a prayer in the Bible.

00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:20.206
You'll find her. Take it easy.

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:23.584
Take your time.
Well, better get back to the airport.

00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:25.127
Good luck, Jeff.

00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:26.963
See you someday.

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:36.639
It wasn't all a lie
because she did take a steamer.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:39.392
It was just that it went north
instead of south.

00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.644
And I was on it too.

00:33:42.396 --> 00:33:45.147
I opened an office in San Francisco.

00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.943
A cheap little rat hole
that suited the work I did.

00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:51.988
Shabby jobs for who'd ever hire me.

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:56.742
It was the bottom of the barrel,
and I scraped it, but I didn't care.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.203
I had her.

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:02.123
We kept pretty much to ourselves.

00:34:02.332 --> 00:34:04.750
We found a little movie house
in North Beach.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.421
We were on the run. We went to places
we never would've seen in our lives.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.298
And after a while,
we grew a little more sure of ourselves.

00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:15.886
We drifted back to more familiar places,
ballparks and the racetracks.

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:21.100
Why not? After all, there wasn't one chance
in a million we'd bump into our past.

00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:25.521
One chance in a million.

00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:30.484
One chance in a million was all that chump
ever had in his life, and he made it good.

00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:34.155
He stood there with our lives in his pocket,
because I knew if he saw her...

00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:37.116
...he'd sell us both for $1.95.

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:39.660
So we had to separate.

00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:44.874
I went alone to L.A.,
and I made it easy for him to follow me.

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.794
He was a good gumshoe.
It was the one thing he could really do.

00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:51.672
So I went everywhere
like a guy enjoying the country.

00:34:51.882 --> 00:34:54.508
I didn't write to her or phone or telegraph.

00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.677
I just waited and moved.

00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:00.139
When it seemed right,
I blew out of town to go and meet her.

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:04.518
I wasn't bad at the game myself. I was sure
I had shaken him loose, and I felt good.

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:14.695
Fisher was back there somewhere,
and I could see her again.

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:19.283
We'd arranged to meet at a little cabin
off the highway on Pyramid Creek.

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:21.660
It was dark when I was getting there.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.622
And then I saw her
walking up the road in the headlights.

00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:34.632
- You want a lift, babe?
- Well, I really hadn't ought.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:39.220
You're a cute little package
to be out walking alone at night.

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:42.098
You're kind of cute yourself
to be walking alone any night.

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:43.682
That does it.

00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:51.982
It was meeting her somewhere,
like in the first times.

00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.735
There was still that something
about her that got me.

00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:57.113
A kind of magic or whatever it was.

00:35:57.656 --> 00:36:01.450
Well, I held her, and we could laugh
because we were together again.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.829
We'd played it smart and forgotten nothing.

00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:07.623
Forgotten nothing except one thing.

00:36:18.135 --> 00:36:19.677
He had followed her.

00:36:19.886 --> 00:36:21.178
Hello, Jeff.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.857
Don't I get introduced?

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.653
I don't blame you, Jeff.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.656
Maybe I'd have lied
my head off just like you did.

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.993
Your picture don't do you justice, baby.

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.205
- Why don't you break his head, Jeff?
- Cute.

00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:51.709
Whit should've got her back.
As I understand, they deserve each other.

00:36:51.918 --> 00:36:55.337
- You working for him now?
- Who else would he get to find my partner?

00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:57.715
All right, Fisher, what's the pitch?

00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:00.676
You and I had a little deal, Jeff.

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:04.096
Ten grand and expenses, fifty-fifty.

00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:07.600
Remember? You used to have a good
memory. Whatever happened to it?

00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:10.019
- I didn't collect.
- Not the 10 grand.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:14.148
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where
we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.

00:37:14.357 --> 00:37:15.649
Jeff.

00:37:16.026 --> 00:37:17.860
He isn't going to tell Whit anything.

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:22.448
Sure not. You just come up with that
40 grand, and we're all pals again.

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:26.285
- I might even cut you in for a piece of it.
- There isn't any 40 grand.

00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:28.287
Of course Whit's broad-minded.

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.706
He don't care about a few slugs
in the stomach...

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.917
...or the 40 grand the dame went off with...

00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:35.920
...or even Jeff pretending
he fell down on the job.

00:37:36.588 --> 00:37:40.633
But you and Jeff ganging up together,
he might not like that.

00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.968
Tell him, Kathie.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.387
Sure, I shot him.

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.264
I'm not sorry about that.

00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.266
But I didn't take his money.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.728
- Beat it.
- Look at all the angles.

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:55.481
You know Whit and you know
how far he can reach.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.193
So just pay me off
and I'm quiet, but use cash.

00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:03.447
Don't try to pay me off with pitch handed
to you by this cheap piece of baggage.

00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:06.575
I was hoping you'd do this.

00:38:44.781 --> 00:38:46.991
- You didn't have to kill him.
- Yes, I did.

00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:51.245
You wouldn't have killed him. You would've
beaten him up and thrown him out.

00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:54.248
- You didn't have to do it.
- You wouldn't have killed him.

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:58.460
He'd have been against us,
gone to Whit.

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.584
I buried him up there.

00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:41.420
I wasn't sorry for him or sore at her.

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:43.172
I wasn't anything.

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.468
- Did you ever see her again?
- No.

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.220
Did you want to?

00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:52.806
No.

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:04.777
Well, I told you it wasn't a nice story.

00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:07.321
And I said once that whatever had
happened was done.

00:40:07.697 --> 00:40:09.990
Yeah, but you should've known
about it long ago.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.576
It's all right. I understand.

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:14.370
And it's all past.

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:15.996
Maybe it isn't.

00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:18.374
- What'll happen?
- I don't know.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:21.293
It's been a long time.
I don't know how much he knows.

00:40:21.503 --> 00:40:22.711
Don't go, Jeff.

00:40:22.921 --> 00:40:26.965
I've got to. I'm tired of running.
I gotta clean this up some way.

00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.967
Just one thing, Ann.

00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:30.552
Do you want me to come back?

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:32.304
Of course.

00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:40.646
Put that in your pocket.

00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.849
Look who's here.

00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:21.854
Hello, Markham.
Glad to see you again.

00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:23.939
I always wondered if you missed me.

00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:26.525
Ah. Same guy. Time-proof, weatherproof.

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:28.819
- Cigarette?
- Smoking.

00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:35.993
- Thanks. Had breakfast?
- No.

00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:38.412
Joe, tell the boy we have a guest.

00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:41.582
Say, I understand you're operating
a little gasoline station.

00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:44.334
- You say it like it's hard to understand.
- Well, it is.

00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:47.880
It's very simple. I sell gasoline.
I make a small profit.

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.799
With that I buy groceries,
the grocer makes a profit.

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:54.386
They call it earning a living.
You may have heard of it somewhere.

00:41:54.596 --> 00:41:57.681
I may have, but it wasn't from you.

00:41:57.891 --> 00:42:00.476
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Whit.
- My feelings?

00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:04.146
Ten years ago, I hid them somewhere
and I haven't been able to find them.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.856
Where did you look?

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:07.941
In my pocketbook.

00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:10.652
Nice, isn't it?

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.530
Yeah, it must have set you back
a few shells.

00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:16.867
Always worrying about my expenses.

00:42:17.076 --> 00:42:18.994
It's a nice view.
Am I here to admire it?

00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:20.787
Not exactly.

00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:22.956
I need your help.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:24.500
Like old times.

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:26.835
I always liked you.

00:42:27.337 --> 00:42:30.797
You liked me because you could use me.
You could use me because I was smart.

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:33.008
I'm not smart anymore.
I run a gas station.

00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:34.801
I like the view.

00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:36.678
Can you still listen?

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.347
I can hear.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.390
Well, you told me about your business.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.394
Well, mine is a little more precarious,
and I earn considerably more.

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:45.812
So I've heard.

00:42:46.022 --> 00:42:47.648
So has the government.

00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:50.734
Well, this may sound ridiculous,
but you could pay them.

00:42:50.944 --> 00:42:53.820
- That would be against my nature.
- All right, forget I said it.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.408
So I collaborated with a certain man
who understands these things.

00:42:58.618 --> 00:43:00.786
He saved me quite a bit of money,
$1 million.

00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:05.415
I didn't particularly trust him,
so I paid him well, but he's unhappy.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.335
- He wants more money.
- Well, he saved you a lot.

00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:12.214
Oh, I appreciate it. I always remember
what any man did for me.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.632
Or didn't.

00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:17.761
Perhaps. The point is that
now he wants 200,000.

00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:21.723
Or he could get 10 percent of the million
from the government, if he turns you in.

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.684
You're up on these things.

00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:27.521
- Has he got anything to trade?
- Well, he has the income tax records.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.692
But I don't see why I should buy them
when I might persuade you to get them.

00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:33.569
- Then I'd have them.
- I know.

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.195
But I can trust you.

00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:37.739
You know, I don't think
you can trust anybody.

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:40.242
You better go in there
and get them yourself.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.869
- I'd rather you did it.
- I pass.

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:44.288
You don't like it?

00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:46.999
No, I just can't get away
from my business.

00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.459
Well, it's a nice view.

00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:51.461
Let's have some breakfast.

00:43:58.678 --> 00:44:00.846
You remember Kathie, don't you?

00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.350
Yeah, I remember Kathie.

00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:09.104
Sit down.

00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:11.982
Kathie's back in the fold now.

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:15.485
- You're back in the fold too, Jeff.
- I see what you mean.

00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:17.904
You see, Jeff, you owe me something.

00:44:18.114 --> 00:44:20.324
You'll never be happy
until you square yourself.

00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:23.368
Did you bare your heart to him, Kathie?

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.579
I couldn't help it, Jeff.

00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:30.042
- Well, that settles things.
- Does it?

00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:31.793
You're working for me.

00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:34.630
This man I told you about,
his name is Leonard Eels...

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.590
...but, uh, you won't go to him directly.

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:39.134
He has a secretary
that he's rather fond of.

00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:42.179
Her name is Meta Carson.
You'll find her charming.

00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:44.222
She may even find you charming.

00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.808
I understand that women have.

00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:49.102
She'll tell you how it's lined up.

00:44:50.355 --> 00:44:52.981
You, uh, know San Francisco, don't you?

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.234
Yeah, I was there once at a party.

00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:58.904
- Then you get around.
- Like the monkey and the weasel.

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.240
We'll put you on a train this afternoon.

00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:06.995
- Right now, I'd like to get some sleep.
- Find Joe. He'll show you to your room.

00:45:07.997 --> 00:45:10.457
And don't start worrying.

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:12.334
Why should I?

00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:38.235
Jeff, I had to come back.
What else could I do?

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.987
You can never help anything, can you?

00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:45.325
You're like a leaf that the wind blows
from one gutter to another.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.870
You can't help anything you do,
even murder.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.124
- You can't say it was that.
- I can say one thing. I buried him.

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.460
- What did you tell him? About us?
- Uh...

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.591
- But you couldn't help it, could you?
- He looked right into me and he knew it.

00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:03.635
- How much?
- What, Jeff?

00:46:03.845 --> 00:46:06.054
About Fisher.
Did he look into you for that too?

00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:08.140
No, I didn't tell that.

00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:10.934
- Don't lie to me.
- I didn't.

00:46:11.144 --> 00:46:13.979
I wouldn't tell him that.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.

00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:16.231
I swear it, Jeff. Believe me.

00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:18.400
Sure. Sure, I believe you.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.402
I didn't know what to do.

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.238
I was always afraid of him
and afraid of what I'd done.

00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:26.324
I couldn't live that way anymore.
I couldn't stand it.

00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:28.410
Oh, Jeff, I've missed you.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:31.913
I've wondered about you
and prayed you'd understand.

00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.331
Can you understand?

00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:35.041
You prayed, Kathie?

00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:37.335
Can't you even feel sorry for me?

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.963
- I'm not going to try.
- Jeff...

00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:43.216
Look, just get out, will you?
I have to sleep in this room.

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:49.556
Let's just leave it where it all is.
Get out.

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.522
- Meta Carson?
- Yes.

00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:41.483
- My name is Bailey.
- Come in.

00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:47.656
- I was expecting you.
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:50.992
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Whit told me you'd be charming.

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:53.370
Really? Would you like a gin and tonic?

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.914
- That'd be nice.
- You may have whiskey, if you like.

00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:58.124
That'd be even nicer.

00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:04.422
Miserable weather we're having,
isn't it?

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:09.386
- Are you acquainted with San Francisco?
- We were quite intimate.

00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:12.472
- Indeed?
- We lived together.

00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:14.307
It's a nice apartment you have here.

00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:17.853
Yes, these old houses can be amusing
when they're remodeled, can't they?

00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.480
I used to live in one
in New York that was old.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.148
It wasn't very amusing.

00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:25.819
- I've never been to New York.
- You take a trip there sometime.

00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.738
You'll see one reason
why I'm in San Francisco.

00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:30.490
Whit said you'd tell me the other.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.703
You know, you're rather charming yourself,
but I'm afraid I don't quite understand you.

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:36.872
If you'll drop this Junior League patter...

00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:39.457
...we may get the conversation
down where it belongs.

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:43.128
- You worried about something?
- I don't know. Should I be?

00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:47.299
- Not if you do what you're told.
- That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told.

00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:51.344
People trust me.
Whit even trusts me twice. Do you?

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:53.847
Just as far as I have to.

00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:57.642
Can you find your way
to 114 Fulton Street?

00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:59.644
- When?
- Tonight.

00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:03.148
I'll be there in the apartment
of an attorney named Leonard Eels.

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:05.817
You can call for me at 8
and look around.

00:49:06.027 --> 00:49:09.154
I can depend on that.
We'll leave together.

00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:11.656
In a day or so,
he'll take some papers home.

00:49:11.866 --> 00:49:13.158
I'll let you know.

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:15.493
Then you get them.
He won't be there.

00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:16.995
Where will he be?

00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:20.457
With me. I'm his secretary.

00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:23.835
- Well, it sounds simple enough.
- It is.

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:27.047
- Like two and two make four.
- That's right.

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.971
Just remember, I'm coming out of this
in one piece, Miss Carson.

00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:38.850
Do you always go around leaving
your fingerprints on a girl's shoulder?

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.813
Not that I mind particularly.
You've got nice strong hands.

00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:01.498
- Jeff.
- Petey, how are you?

00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:03.541
Where you been?
You marry an honest dame?

00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:07.212
- I went in the gasoline business.
- But you're looking for me now, ain't you?

00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:10.674
I went out of business.
Come on, let's take a ride in your hack.

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:16.888
Buddy, you look like you're in trouble.

00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:19.975
- Why?
- Because you don't act like it.

00:50:20.518 --> 00:50:22.769
I think I'm in a frame.

00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:24.980
Don't sound like you.

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:27.524
I don't know.
All I can see is the frame.

00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:29.859
I'm going in there now
to look at the picture.

00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:33.571
- I don't have to tell you to wait.
- You don't have to tell me nothing.

00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:04.561
My name is Jeff Bailey.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.605
Oh, yes, Miss Carson said
you'd pick her up. I'm Leonard Eels.

00:51:07.815 --> 00:51:10.316
- How do you do?
- Bring him out here, Leonard.

00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:18.408
Thank you.

00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:20.201
Hello, Jeffrey.

00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:23.163
I always wanted my favorite cousin
to meet my favorite boss.

00:51:23.372 --> 00:51:25.165
- Apple martini?
- Thanks.

00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:28.293
Meta talked about you like
you're the ninth wonder of the world.

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:30.545
- She skipped one.
- Meta must be the eighth.

00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:34.507
All women are wonders because
they reduce all men to the obvious.

00:51:34.717 --> 00:51:36.634
And so do martinis.

00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:39.804
So nice here, I hate to go.

00:51:40.014 --> 00:51:42.640
Don't then. Why don't you both stay
and have dinner?

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.309
Yes, why don't we?

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:47.395
We can't, Jeffrey.
We promised the Bigelows, remember?

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:49.689
Oh, call them up. We can see them anytime.

00:51:49.899 --> 00:51:51.858
We can't, Jeffrey. I'm sorry, Leonard.

00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:54.819
Some other time.
How long will you be in town, Mr. Bailey?

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:58.239
- I don't really know.
- You're on business?

00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:01.451
- You might call it that.
- Where are you from? The South?

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:06.206
- No. Tahoe.
- We must go, Jeff.

00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:08.083
All right.

00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:14.130
Your, uh, cousin
is a very charming young lady.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.301
No, he isn't. His name is Norman
and he's a bookmaker in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.348
- Where did you say you were from?
- Tahoe...

00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:26.559
...where we worry as much
about the income tax as anybody.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.854
Frankly, you don't make sense.

00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:32.232
Neither does my being her cousin...

00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.651
...or my being brought up here...

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.778
...to, uh, leave my fingerprints around.

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:38.822
On the other hand, maybe it does.

00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:41.991
You know, it could be that I'm the patsy,
and you're on the spot.

00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.661
- Coming, Jeff?
- Right away.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.664
Keep the martinis dry, I'll be back.

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:55.255
I'm glad you could come, both of you.

00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:57.674
- Mr. Eels, you make a great martini.
- Thank you.

00:52:57.883 --> 00:52:59.092
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:01.678
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:11.312
For a man who appears to be clever,
you can act like an idiot.

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:14.607
That's one way to be clever:
Look like an idiot.

00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:18.987
He looked like an underweight ghost.
What did you say to him?

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.989
I told him he made a great martini.

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:23.199
- You are an idiot.
- So is he.

00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:26.828
- You think so?
- Why not? He's in love with you.

00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:34.043
Mason Building.

00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:42.177
Doesn't your conscience bother you,
crossing a nice guy like that?

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:44.137
Maybe he isn't such a nice guy.

00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:46.181
Maybe he crosses people too.

00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:56.024
- Do I go alone?
- No, you go back to your hotel and wait.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.151
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:06.034
- Nice.
- Awfully cold around the heart. Let's go.

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.660
Hold it.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.538
Drive around the block
and stop right here.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.881
Follow her, Petey, then wait for me
at Eels' apartment house.

00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:49.257
- I lost her.
- She's worth losing.

00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:53.428
I jumped a signal and I got stopped
by a gabby cop.

00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:56.097
Here. You finish it.

00:57:57.015 --> 00:57:58.933
- Shall I pick up her hack?
- No.

00:57:59.143 --> 00:58:01.978
- Where to?
- Telegraph Hill.

00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:03.729
Did you have some bad luck?

00:58:03.939 --> 00:58:06.983
Yeah. My timing was a few minutes off.

00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:39.158
- Hello?
- Mr. Tillotson.

00:59:39.368 --> 00:59:41.702
- Yes.
- This is Mr. Eels' secretary.

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:43.538
I'm worried about Mr. Eels.

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:45.998
I know he's home,
but he doesn't answer his phone.

00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:48.626
- Would you see if he's all right?
- Maybe he went out.

00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:50.545
No, he was to wait for my call.

00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:55.007
I don't want to be a nuisance,
but I'm sure he's there and I'm worried.

00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:57.468
- Would you call me right back?
- Yes.

00:59:57.678 --> 00:59:59.845
Fillmore 0710.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:03.224
- Yes, Miss Carson. Right away.
- Thank you.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.135
- Yes?
- He isn't there.

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.928
He isn't?

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.097
- Did you go in the apartment?
- Yes.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.474
But he must be there.

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:47.643
Thank you.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.657
- Hello?
- Joe Stephanos, please.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.075
He isn't here.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:06.704
Then leave word for him to call
Miss Carson's apartment right away.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.419
Was there a slip-up, baby?

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.967
Did you send your friend up there
to find Eels dead?

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.803
- No, Jeff.
- Tell me.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.014
- Tell me.
- Don't, Jeff.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:26.974
- Don't what?
- I don't want to die.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.144
Neither do I, baby.
But if I have to, I'm gonna die last.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.771
Something slipped up, didn't it?

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.066
They told you they'd knock him off,
and haven't done it, have they?

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:38.152
They haven't because I tipped him off.
He blew.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:40.321
- He's all right?
- Didn't you want him to be?

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.866
Yes. Yes, because if he dies,
they'll say you did it.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.827
Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.
You're magnificent.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:51.040
- You can change sides so smoothly.
- Don't, Jeff. You're hurting me.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.959
I'm almost getting it.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.795
Very pretty.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:59.131
Whit wants Eels out of the picture
and to square an account with me.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.967
Two birds together.
So I come to town with an address.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.804
A redhead takes me up to visit
the chump who has to go.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:07.223
I have a drink, leave my prints around.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:09.183
I leave and somebody gets him.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.644
Eels dies and the tax papers...

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.480
...they were in the briefcase
that Meta took, weren't they?

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.358
The papers go back to Whit.
I'm the fall guy.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.068
There's only one thing missing:

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.653
The plant.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:24.657
What was there to give me a motive?
I wouldn't kill a guy for a martini.

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.659
- Tell me, Kathie.
- They made me sign it.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.452
- Sign what?
- An affidavit.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.329
- Go on.
- I couldn't help it, Jeff.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:33.165
They made me sign it.
I swear I couldn't help it.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:36.293
They said they'd find the body
and tell the police I killed him.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:39.130
Fisher. Then you did tell them about Fisher.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.215
Only you told them I did it.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:42.883
Perfect.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.261
Foolproof and beautiful.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.096
That Whit can really hate, can't he?

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.306
You said it once, he can remember.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.642
I never stopped hating him, Jeff.

01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:54.145
I couldn't help myself. I was caught too.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.355
We don't have to be against
each other now.

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:58.649
- Aren't we?
- No. We can break out of it.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:00.401
All we need is the briefcase.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.155
Then we've got them, Jeff.
We can get anything we want from them.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.031
I'd like that affidavit you signed.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.784
We can get it. It's in Eels' office safe.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:12.329
We can make Meta get it.
We can make them do anything.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.039
Sure.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:15.499
Oh, Jeff...

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.918
You ought to have killed me
for what I did.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:21.088
- There's time.
- No. You won't.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.174
I've never stopped loving you.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.385
I was afraid and no good,
but I never stopped...

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.512
...even if you hated me.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:29.930
Did you?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.476
- Yes.
- But you don't now.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.854
No.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.315
We can be together again.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:42.777
In a way we never were.
We can go back to Acapulco...

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.821
...and start all over
as though nothing had happened.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.698
Yes.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.831
How do we get the briefcase?

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.500
Whit owns a club.

01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:59.585
The Sterling Club on North Beach.

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.963
Meta took it there
to a man named Baylord.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.799
I might get by with it.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.467
You will, darling.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:09.303
Hurry.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.326
What happened to you?

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.079
I went to a bar and bought a double.
I must be slipping.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.039
I guess you must be.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:41.877
He just stood there shaking so hard
he couldn't even pray.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:45.256
I never saw anyone so afraid to die.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.675
- I didn't like it.
- You killed him?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.719
Certainly.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:55.140
But I called. A man went up and looked
in the apartment and he wasn't there.

01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:59.019
- Eels?
- Yes, Eels. He wasn't there.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.064
I was there. And the way I left him,
he didn't walk away.

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:06.068
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.655
I do. Where's Bailey?

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:55.993
What do you want?

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:02.082
- Yeah?
- Mr. Baylord, a man just went up...

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.835
...heading toward your office.
- Forget it.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:42.206
- You wanted to see somebody?
- I just saw him. Thanks.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.735
- You know that hack driver?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.821
- Rafferty.
- Yeah?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.991
Get Joe. Bring back that guy
any way you have to.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.244
- Just so that briefcase comes with him.
- Right.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.291
- All arranged, sir.
- Twenty for you, the rest for transportation.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.128
Have the boy meet me
at the airport with the ticket.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:32.715
- Thank you, sir.
- You know, a bad memory is like an ill wind.

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:37.302
- It can blow somebody luck.
- I always say everybody's right.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.479
After you.

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:51.900
- You won't need this.
- I couldn't do nothing.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.694
You can now. Start moving.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:58.157
- I sure get into a lot of trouble, don't I?
- You shouldn't steal so much.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.420
Well, we meet in all kinds of places.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.471
That evens this. Fold your hands,
or I'll do it for you.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.806
You talk big, mister.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.152
- All right, wise guy.
- I wouldn't.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.488
I told you. I'm tired
of getting pushed around.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.616
You'll only get yourself out of breath.
Won't he, Joe?

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.201
Cut it, Lou.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.496
Your move now is to do a little thinking.
A little talking.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.791
See, I've got the files
that were in your briefcase.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.376
I also know the address
of the Treasury Department.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:54.880
That's the theory, isn't it?
Keep the files away from the treasury boys.

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:57.299
Save Whit from doing 10 years
in a federal pen.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:01.136
- Now, you correct me if I make a mistake.
- We may do that.

01:09:01.346 --> 01:09:04.932
Sure. Of course, the government
may just pat Whit on the back and say:

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:08.936
"Go on home. We got all the dough we
need. We'll never miss your million dollars."

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.396
You wanna lay a price on that?

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.357
How did you know I had the briefcase?

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:17.152
I had Meta tailed.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.114
You sure about that?

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.700
Look, I don't have to be sure
about anything except the files.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:27.121
Now, do you wanna talk business,
or do you wanna play house?

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.957
What's your idea?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.127
You get the files,
and you also get Eels' body...

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.504
...in case you wanna
keep it from the cops.

01:09:35.797 --> 01:09:37.631
What do you want?

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:42.302
I want the affidavit that Meta put
in Eels' safe when she took the files out.

01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:47.182
A lie that somebody put on paper
that I killed a guy named Jack Fisher.

01:09:47.851 --> 01:09:49.476
Because, you see, I only buried him.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:52.354
And you don't get the gas
for being the undertaker.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.816
Four of us knew about that affidavit
outside of Whit.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.776
Somebody talked.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.827
- Did Meta tell you?
- No.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.288
Sorry.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.542
- Put in a call for Whit Sterling...
- No, sit down.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.753
- We better keep Whit out of this.
- He's right, Kathie.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:20.591
Oh, you've hurt her feelings, Lou.
I can tell you, she's a sensitive girl.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.677
- I'm kind of sensitive myself.
- And you won't need Whit.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:27.139
All you'll need is Meta
to unlock that safe in Eels' office.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:30.017
- I hope Meta's still around.
- She's around.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.644
Good. Then you can start right now.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:36.773
I'll call you in about an hour. That'll
give you time to find her and get there.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:40.194
Give you a little extra time to figure out
how you're gonna cross me.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.154
But you won't.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.958
Will you bust this for me, Jackson?

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.709
Sure.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.507
That's right. Whit Sterling
at the Blue Sky Club in Reno.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:47.469
- Shut the door.
- Don't forget, those dames listen in.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.142
- Hello?
- Mr. Sterling?

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:55.519
- Speaking.
- One moment.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.313
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:01.483
- Whit, darling, this is Kathie.
- Everything all right?

01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:03.527
- No.
- Seldom is.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.154
I think you'd better stay
where you are for a while.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:09.157
- Well, could you tell me why?
- I can't talk now.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:10.993
Things are mixed up.

01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:12.703
Bailey mix them?

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:15.372
I can't talk on the phone.
We're trying to get a plane.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.624
But you're bringing me something?

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:22.087
No, Whit. I can't explain now, darling.
I just wanted to tell you.

01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:24.798
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.467
- Like what, honey?
- Don't go to Tahoe.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.096
Be careful and wait in Reno for me.
Goodbye.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.441
- You look like I might be in trouble.
- You will be if we don't find Bailey.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.068
I might be if I do.

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:17.309
"Bridgeport service station operator
sought in San Francisco slaying.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.312
Five-year-old murder motive,
the police say.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.774
Leonard Eels, attorney, was found
murdered in his apartment house...

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:27.527
...114 Fulton Street,
early this morning." Well.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:31.031
"Jeff Bailey, at one time
private detective and more recently...

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.201
...operator of a small gas station
in Bridgeport...

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:38.163
...is hunted for two murders."
- I knew he was no good.

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:42.000
I said all along, "There's a man
who should be run out of town."

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:46.213
Look at that. Police are hunting him
for two murders.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.299
- I told you, Ann.
- Ann.

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.968
Oh, leave me alone.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.022
Cooper reporting. Road
is now blocked 20 miles south of Bridgeport.

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.483
Checking all cars. That is all.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.653
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Ed. You talked to the kid yet?

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.030
He's gone. The station's locked up tight.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.492
- Gone where?
- Maybe with Bailey.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.662
Well, that doesn't make sense.
If you had the law on your tail...

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.706
...would you let a guy working for you
come up to chew the fat?

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:25.168
I'd want a partner, if I could get him.

01:14:26.838 --> 01:14:28.463
- Ed?
- Yeah?

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.048
Our attention.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:33.885
Says, "Bailey took a plane to L.A.
last night. No trace since."

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:35.971
Says, "May be headed this way."

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.639
Okay.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:41.977
Would you consider it too dumb
for him to try to hole up here?

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.896
He'll come here.
And when he does, I'll know it.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.940
See you.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:55.824
- What's he mean, he'll know it?
- What do you suppose? Ann Miller.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.035
Me? I'll take the kid.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.674
You all right, Ann?

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:16.470
I know what you're going to say,
and I don't wanna hear it.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.347
Jeff didn't kill anybody.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.057
He told me everything.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.810
Has he got you mixed up in this?

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:27.355
- Has he?
- Whatever he's mixed up in, I am too.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:29.983
Well, I'm not going to stand by
and see him hurt you.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.611
- If he comes back here...
- What'll you do?

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.405
- You won't go to the police.
- I don't know what I'll do.

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:36.907
No, Jimmy.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.910
Do you expect me to help him get away?

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.204
Jim.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:52.130
He can read your lips.

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.635
Mr. Sterling is fishing.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:59.304
No. In the high mountains.

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:01.806
Tell Jeff we're sending for him.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.184
Where can we reach you?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.987
Joe will find you at the station
when we have word.

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:29.084
I'm not so sure this is a bright idea.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:32.295
You think of a brighter one
on the way, come back with it.

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:24.157
He follow you from Tahoe?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.409
Who'd you see? Sterling?

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:28.411
Kathie?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.751
Cute kids, aren't they?

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:06.825
What are you scared about?

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:11.746
Joe isn't coming back.
He got careless and fell in the river.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:16.000
Didn't you hear what I said?
Joe's dead, Kathie.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.920
Can't you find some tears for him?

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:22.966
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do?

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.218
Talk to Whit.
Don't you think I should?

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:28.930
Yes, of course you should.
He wants to see you. He's waiting for you.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.891
With his fishing rod?
You told the kid he was fishing.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.644
He, uh, came back late this afternoon.

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:37.272
I'll bet he's pacing up and down,
worrying about Joe.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:42.110
- You think I sent Joe?
- Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:46.197
- All right. Where is the gentleman?
- Downstairs. In the library, I think.

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:49.075
Jeff, don't let him trick you.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.703
He'll pay anything you ask.
He'll do anything you ask.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.581
Sure he will. Anything.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.088
If only there was some way about Fisher.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.090
There is.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:19.355
Well, you getting things in shape
for the treasury boys?

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:23.151
Hello, Jeff. I've been sort of
expecting you.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:27.155
Well, let's get down to business.
Start all over again, right?

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.909
- You have some papers of mine.
- All right, you take the frame off me.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:33.328
You pin the Eels murder on Joe.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.290
Sure. Sure.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.460
I get a modest settlement. Say...

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.378
Oh, say 50,000.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:46.090
That should be enough for me
to spend my waning years in Mazatlán.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.636
Not Acapulco because I'd keep
thinking about you, Kathie.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.639
Up there in the women's prison
in Tehachapi.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.934
It won't be too bad.
Hills all around you, plenty of sun.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.437
You make me nervous.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:03.858
You'll be happier if you let the cops
have her. That's what you'll have to do.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:07.987
Somebody's gotta take the rap
for Fisher's murder. It's not gonna be me.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.989
Wait a minute.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.409
- I'm not framing any woman.
- When did you reform?

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.412
I wouldn't try it, Whit.
You're out of shape.

01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:20.166
- Besides, it's not a frame. She shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:24.254
See, Whit? Self-defense. A cinch to beat.
She might not even have to do time.

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:28.299
- I'll say you killed him. They'll believe me.
- Do you believe her?

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.512
Go on, Kathie, tell him about Joe.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.806
What about Joe? Where is he?

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:37.725
Last time I saw him,
he was in the East Walker River.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:41.354
I didn't send him after Jeff.
It was his own idea.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:46.734
- Did you kill him?
- He slipped and fell.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:50.488
When I got there, it was too late.
That's a mean river.

01:21:50.698 --> 01:21:51.906
He was trailing you?

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.492
Well, you don't go fishing
with a.45 in your hand.

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:57.245
But stop worrying about it.
It makes everything simple.

01:21:57.454 --> 01:22:01.165
A dead man? Fish him out.
Stick a note in his pocket. Suicide.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.419
He couldn't stand living
with what he had done.

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:07.839
Don't look so stricken, Whit.
You'll get over it. I did.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.467
But you talk it out if you want to.
I'll be waiting in there.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.469
Oh, one thing, Kathie:

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:16.806
Did it take much persuasion
to make you say I killed Fisher?

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:21.019
Come on. Feed my ego.
Tell me he beat you.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:24.272
Tell me he had to drag
every word out of you.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.610
- Well, that's the way it is.
- You said you were going.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.570
Get out.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.923
You dirty little phony.
Go on, lie some more.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.634
Tell me how you handled things
for me in San Francisco.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.844
Tell me it was all Joe's idea.
Go on, Kathie.

01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:57.639
Show me how you're gonna
squirm your way out this time.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:00.642
- Listen...
- What a sucker you must think I am.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:04.312
I took you back when you
came whimpering and crawling.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:07.231
I should have kicked your teeth in.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:10.485
No, I'm not going to.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:14.739
Not now, Kathie.
We'll let the law push you around.

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:16.658
- You can't.
- You're wrong.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:18.868
You're gonna take the rap and play along.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:21.788
You're gonna make every exact move
I tell you.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.290
If you don't, I'll kill you.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.126
And I'll promise you one thing:
It won't be quick.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.212
I'll break you first.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:33.257
You won't be able to answer a phone or
open a door without thinking, "This is it."

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:37.011
And when it comes,
it still won't be quick.

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.222
And it won't be pretty.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:43.226
You can take your choice.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.561
Whit.

01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:08.126
I have to go to Reno for your money.
Where's the file?

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.628
It'll be mailed to you.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.048
I crossed you once. I know better
than to try it a second time.

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:17.802
I've got a reason for wanting
to be let alone.

01:24:18.012 --> 01:24:20.513
You'll get the file,
after I'm out of reach.

01:24:22.016 --> 01:24:24.726
Well, if that's the way it has to be.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.979
While you're in Reno, find a pilot
who can keep his mouth shut.

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:31.482
Tell him to set his plane down
in the desert where he won't be seen.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.526
Make it about dawn.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:36.487
And cheer up, Kathie.
You'll get out of it all right.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.865
You always have.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.249
- They say you killed a man.
- Do you believe them?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:34.295
- Not until you tell me.
- You believe everything I say, don't you?

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:37.298
Everything you say to me, I believe.

01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:40.009
I don't know why I do this.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:43.596
I don't know why I let you come back
into my life. Why I don't...

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:46.974
...slap your face and send you home.
I don't know.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:50.228
- Because you said you'd come back.
- But not like this.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:53.397
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:56.609
You know, I had to come back.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.700
- Take me with you, Jeff.
- I have to play this alone.

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:09.413
- You've seen her again?
- Yeah, I saw her.

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:12.959
- Was it the same?
- I saw her, and it was nothing.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.963
She can't be all bad. No one is.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.632
Well, she comes the closest.

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:22.635
- Are you going to see her again?
- Tonight, for the last time.

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:25.721
Then look at her. And look at yourself.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:30.935
And be very sure that there isn't even
a little bit of love left for her.

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:36.482
Then when you find out
and you know it once and forever...

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:38.484
...send for me.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:42.196
I don't have to find out.
I know it now.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:47.910
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- You know, maybe I was wrong...

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.289
...and luck is like love.
You have to go all the way to find it.

01:26:51.582 --> 01:26:53.457
You do to keep it.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:56.419
You better go.
Did the kid do what I told him?

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:59.463
They're following him south,
the state police and all of them.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:00.923
Good.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.468
I can't go.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:27.325
- You can put that away.
- I can't think of a better place to put it.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:32.330
- I just want to tell you something.
- Tell it.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:33.998
I was going to kill you.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.918
- Who isn't?
- Or tell the cops where you were.

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:40.880
I followed Ann tonight.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:45.760
- What stopped you?
- Some things you said to her.

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:49.555
- You said were gonna tell me something.
- I grew up with her.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:52.350
I've loved her ever since
I fixed her roller skates.

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:55.645
I don't know whether I'm good enough
for her, but I know you aren't.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.898
That's one difference.
The other is that she loves me.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:02.485
You told her you didn't know why
you let her back into your dirty life.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:05.988
I don't know what got you where you are
or where it's gonna take you.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:08.366
She's not going with it.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:11.661
Why don't you say it to the law.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:15.081
Then all the rest of your life
you can tell her how you did it.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.089
You can't make deals with a dead man, Jeff.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:07.800
No, you can't.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.101
- Let's get out of here.
- There's someplace left to go?

01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:20.646
- I think so.
- You're running the show now?

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.444
Do you mind, Jeff?

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:33.326
Remember the mountains? Higher than these
and always snow on them.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:37.455
- We should have stayed there.
- I'm trying to remember something else.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:39.999
I never told you I was anything
but what I am.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.293
You just wanted to imagine I was.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:45.796
That's why I left you.
Now we're back to stay.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:49.675
- And I have nothing to say about it?
- Well, have you?

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:53.512
Whit's dead.
A bundle of papers isn't any good.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:56.974
If Joe was around, you could
use him, but Joe's dead too.

01:29:57.184 --> 01:29:59.435
So, what are you gonna do
about Eels and Fisher?

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.979
For that matter,
what are you gonna do about this?

01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:04.190
Someone has to take the blame.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:08.652
You have nothing on me, but I'd make
a fine witness for the prosecution.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:13.532
Don't you see? You've only me
to make deals with now.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:17.078
- Well, build my gallows high, baby.
- No.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:21.707
No, we're starting all over.
I wanna go back to Mexico.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.794
I wanna walk out of the sun again
and find you waiting.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:28.964
I wanna sit in the same moonlight
and tell you all the things I never told you...

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:32.885
...until you don't hate me.
Until sometime you love again.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:36.013
They'll always be looking for us.
They won't stop till we die.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:39.517
I don't care.
Just so they find us together.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:44.772
If you're thinking of anyone else, don't.
It wouldn't work.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:47.274
You're no good for anyone but me.

01:30:47.484 --> 01:30:49.360
You're no good and neither am I.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.571
That's why we deserve each other.

01:30:58.412 --> 01:31:00.246
Did he get the plane?

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.707
- Where is it?
- I'm running the show, don't forget.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:06.001
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Where's the money?

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:10.131
- Upstairs.
- Better pack a couple of bags and get it.

01:31:12.426 --> 01:31:15.886
- Put a few things in for me.
- I have.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:06.979
Thanks.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:12.151
Do you remember La Mar Azul?

01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:15.863
If I remember, you were a very
clumsy flirt, but I liked that.

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:18.157
We owe it all to José Rodriguez.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.953
I wonder if he'll ever know
what a bad guide he really was.

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:27.541
Jeff, we've been wrong a lot
and unlucky a long time.

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:30.294
I think we deserve a break.

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.672
We deserve each other.

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:08.040
Hurry, Jeff.

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:55.546
Dirty, double-crossing rat!

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.595
Sorry.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:51.935
Too many people. Too much talk.

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:54.355
Maybe that's why I like this town.

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.608
Here, three people are really a crowd.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:02.363
Let's get in the car
and get away from them.

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:05.407
I won't talk to you, Ann.
I just wanna be with you.

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:08.744
Thanks, Jim, but I can't.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.633
You can tell me.
You knew him better than I did.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.719
Was he going away with her?

01:35:27.097 --> 01:35:29.223
I have to know.

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:32.976
Was he going away with her?
