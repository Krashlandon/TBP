00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.994
<i>My dad was a farmer.</i>

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.622
Like everybody else back then.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.918
<i>Of course, he didn't start that way.</i>

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.301
<i>Computer says you're too tight.</i>

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.094
Nah, I got this.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.846
<i>Crossing the Straights.</i>

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.017
- <i>Shutting it down, Cooper.</i>
- No!

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.937
- <i>Shutting it all down.</i>
- No, I need power up!

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.318
Dad?

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.368
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.204
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.000
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.210
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.383
That's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.552
Were you dreaming about the crash?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.264
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.793
<i>The wheat had died.</i>

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.962
<i>The blight came and we had to burn it.</i>

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.591
<i>And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.</i>

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.010
But mostly we had dust.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.932
<i>I can't describe it.
It was just constant.</i>

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.643
Just that steady blow...

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.103
<i>...of dirt.</i>

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.191
<i>We wore little strips of sheet...</i>

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.111
...sometimes over our nose and mouth...

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.822
<i>...so that we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.</i>

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.951
<i>When we set the table,
we always set the plate...</i>

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.079
...upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.455
<i>...upside-down.</i>

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.088
Shake a leg! Murph, move it!

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.717
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.427
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.638
Not at the table, Murph.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.224
Dad, can you fix this?

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.311
- What the heck did you do to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.480
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.983
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.987
- No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.280
Dad, tell her.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.282
It's not very scientific, Murph.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.034
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.703
She's got you there.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.997
Start looking after our stuff.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.833
Coop.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.796
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.050
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.345
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.432
...then present your conclusions. Deal?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.517
- Deal.
- All right.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.522
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.275
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.235
Not grandparent.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.364
Slow down, turbo!

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.786
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.370
Blight?

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.956
They're saying it's the last
harvest for okra.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.792
Ever.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.379
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.174
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.884
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.179
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.308
Why don't you start minding
your own business, old man?

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.275
All right, Murph, give me second.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.072
Third.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.242
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.493
Shut it, Tom!

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.163
- What'd you do, Murph?
- She didn't do nothing.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.874
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.751
Shut up!

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.962
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.091
Get the patch kit!

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.554
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.722
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.983
What's going on, Murph?

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.236
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.821
We didn't.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.698
Murphy's Law?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:09.661
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:13.331
What it means is whatever
can happen will happen.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.001
And that sounded just fine with us.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.633
Get in.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.428
Get in, let's go.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.890
What about the flat tire?

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.185
Yeah.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:52.120
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.788
Take the wheel, Tom.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.587
Go, go, go!

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.840
Keep that aimed right at it.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.184
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.894
Right at it.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.438
Stay on it.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.107
Here we go.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.952
Nice one, Tom.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.793
Dad?

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.963
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.464
Dad!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:45.882
Tom!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.889
You told me to keep driving.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:58.186
Well, I guess that answers the old
"if I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.234
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.581
What to give it a whirl?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.797
This way.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.429
Go.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.433
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.439
Nicely done.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.277
How long you think it's been up there?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.946
Delhi Mission Control went down,
same as ours...

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.656
...ten years ago.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.284
So for ten years?

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.831
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.959
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.378
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.465
Maybe some kind of signal?
I don't know.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.221
What are you gonna do with it?

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.309
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.519
...like drive a combine.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.605
Can't we just let it go?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.567
It wasn't hurting anybody.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.738
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.531
...like the rest of us.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:41.039
- How's this work? You guys come with?
- I've got class.

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.833
This one needs to wait.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.129
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.423
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.843
- Just please try not to.
- Relax.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.596
I got this.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.143
Little late, Coop.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.853
Yeah, we had a flat.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.565
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.361
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.364
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.116
Take a seat.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.743
So...

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.038
...we got Tom's scores back.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.582
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.169
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:32.048
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.259
I still pay my taxes.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.761
Where's the money go?
There's no more armies.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.597
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.850
Look, you have to be realistic.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.769
You're ruling my son out for college now?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.815
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.985
What's your waistline? About 32?

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:56.072
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:00.660
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.372
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.541
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:11.796
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:16.593
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:20.180
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.891
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:27.604
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.024
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.401
No.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.404
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.240
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.618
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.205
She brought this to show the students.
The section on lunar landings.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.916
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.335
She always loved the pictures.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.214
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.465
Corrected?

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:59.761
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.436
You don't believe we went to the moon?

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.522
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.359
The Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources...

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.945
...into rockets and other
useless machines.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.196
"Useless machines."

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:22.492
if we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.454
...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:31.292
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.921
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:38.883
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:42.136
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.431
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.517
...the calmer one.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.270
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.191
But Murph got into a fistfight with several
of her classmates over this...

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.818
...Apollo nonsense.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.654
We thought it best to bring you in
and see what ideas...

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.490
...you might have for dealing
with her behavior.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.703
You know what?
There's a game tomorrow night.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.038
She's going through a baseball phase.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.418
Her favorite team is playing.
There will be candy and soda and....

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.339
I think I'll take her to that.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:24.929
How'd it go?

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.724
I got you suspended.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.475
- What?
- <i>Cooper.</i>

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.395
This is Cooper.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:35.356
<i>Coop, those combines
you rebuilt went haywire.</i>

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.734
Just reset the controllers.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.695
<i>I did that.
You should come take a look.</i>

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.384
One by one they've been peeling off
the fields and heading over.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.428
Something's interfering with the compass.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:09.307
Magnetism or some such.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.893
Nothing special about which book.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.813
I've been working on it, like you said.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.066
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.195
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.531
I'm trying Morse.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.366
Morse?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:09.784
Yeah.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.703
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.915
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.889
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.725
- Which is?
- I don't know.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.604
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.899
...we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.738
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.074
You heard?

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.870
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:59.041
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.211
When I was a kid...

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.674
...it felt like they made
something new every day. Some...

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.344
...gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.473
But six billion people...

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.892
...just try to imagine that.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.896
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.193
This world isn't so bad.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.280
And Tom will do just fine.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:34.202
You're the one who doesn't belong.
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.705
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.375
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.087
Well, we used to look up
in the sky and wonder...

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.673
...at our place in the stars.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:54.472
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.808
Cooper, you were good at something...

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.645
...and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:02.772
I'm sorry.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:08.611
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.031
...to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:16.661
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.413
This happened about 1:30
when that thing...

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.999
...came off the top of that canyon.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.211
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.255
Who are these bums?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.966
In my day, people were too busy...

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.343
...fighting over food
to even play baseball.

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:37.139
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.809
School says you're gonna
follow in my footsteps.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.061
I think that's great.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:45.648
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.692
Grandpa said.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.652
Grandpa said, huh?

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.488
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.448
I like what you do.

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.659
I like our farm.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.745
You're gonna be great at it.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:13.301
Let's get out of here.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.560
All right, it's a doozy.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.104
Gang, let's mask up.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.443
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.582
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.088
Murph?

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:54.527
The ghost.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.655
Grab your pillow.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.282
You're sleeping in with Tom.

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.881
It's not a ghost.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.721
It's gravity.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.725
I'm dropping Tom,
then heading to town.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:12.188
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.799
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.259
Thick is one, thin is zero.

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.057
Coordinates.

00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:51.644
Nope.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.773
Here we go.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.734
Thirty-three.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.780
That's it.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.699
I can't miss this!

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:09.203
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.665
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.000
And that...

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.170
...is why I can't take you.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.386
Murph?

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:30.975
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.357
Jesus.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.901
What are you doing?

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.612
You think this is funny?

00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:46.282
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:50.119
Make yourself useful.

00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:54.808
Hey, Murph?

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.478
Murph!

00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.317
I think this is the end of the road.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.364
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.783
That's my girl.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:39.895
Step away from the fence!

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:43.524
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:50.739
Don't be afraid.

00:25:03.544 --> 00:25:05.629
How did you find this place?

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.673
Where's my daughter?

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:11.844
You had the coordinates for this facility
on your map. Where did you get them?

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.345
Where's my daughter?

00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.473
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:18.934
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.770
Marines don't exist anymore.

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:26.984
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.737
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:32.781
Think I'll turn you into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.116
No, you won't.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.703
TARS, back down, please.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.332
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:46.462
They're old, and their control
units are unpredictable.

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:48.797
It's what the government could spare.

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.633
Who are you?

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:53.427
Dr. Brand.

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:55.971
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:57.848
What makes you think I'm not?

00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.642
Wasn't near as cute, either.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.479
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.774
I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.443
Give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:15.824
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:18.535
Your daughter is fine.

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.037
Bright kid.

00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:22.414
Must have a very smart mother.

00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:25.000
It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.171
So why don't you just let us back up
from your fence and we'll be on our way?

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:32.007
- It's not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:36.011
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:38.055
Yes, you do.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:44.853
Dad!

00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:48.565
Hello, Cooper.

00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:51.068
Professor Brand.

00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:55.197
Explain to me how you found this facility.

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:58.659
Kind of an accident. We stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:01.495
You're sitting in the best-kept
secret in the world.

00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:05.207
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:07.209
Cooper, please.

00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.670
Cooperate with these people.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:11.255
Look.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.715
It's kind of hard to explain.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:18.220
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.264
What sort of anomaly?

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:23.725
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it really wasn't scientific.

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:27.813
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.273
It was gravity.

00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:37.197
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:40.576
I'm real happy that you're
excited about gravity, bud...

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:43.579
...but you're not getting any answers
until I get assurances.

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.455
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.793
That we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:54.423
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.799
No, professor, I don't.

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.010
You know my father, Professor Brand.

00:27:58.635 --> 00:27:59.928
We're NASA.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:03.932
- NASA?
- NASA.

00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.976
The same NASA you flew for.

00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:21.074
I heard they shut you down for refusing
to drop bombs from the stratosphere...

00:28:21.283 --> 00:28:22.910
...onto starving people.

00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:25.412
When they realized killing
other people was...

00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.415
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.584
- In secret.
- Why secret?

00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:34.630
Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:37.466
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.968
Blight.

00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:44.264
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.683
Now there's just corn.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.936
And we're growing more
than we ever have.

00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:53.315
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:56.401
...the corn will die.

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:58.195
Soon.

00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:07.079
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:11.833
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.211
Not just ours, no.

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.338
But it is our home.

00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:20.842
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.844
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:28.100
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our airs gets less and less oxygen.

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:32.020
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:34.356
And your daughter's generation...

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:38.235
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:41.989
Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:44.032
Yeah. Thank you.

00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:47.869
Okay...

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.374
...now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.545
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:03.427
Rangers.

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:08.682
The last components of our one
versatile ship in orbit, the <i>Endurance</i>.

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:10.600
Our final expedition.

00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:14.354
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.273
The Lazarus missions.

00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:19.568
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:21.903
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:25.240
There's not a planet
that could sustain life...

00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:27.909
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.746
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:33.749
Where'd you send them?

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.208
Cooper...

00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:38.378
...I can't tell you more unless you agree...

00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:40.505
...to pilot this craft.

00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:44.009
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:46.428
This team never left the simulator.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:50.515
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.225
Without even knowing it?

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:57.439
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.358
We had no choice.

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:01.318
But something sent you here.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:04.196
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.081
How long would I be gone?

00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:16.166
Hard to know.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:17.751
Years?

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.961
I've got kids, professor.

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:22.506
Get out there and save them.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.344
Who's "they"?

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:31.348
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:35.143
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

00:31:35.352 --> 00:31:38.605
In fact, I believe you
encountered one yourself.

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:41.274
Yeah, over the Straights.

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:45.028
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:46.696
Exactly.

00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:52.160
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:53.537
Out near Saturn...

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.873
...a disturbance of space-time.

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:02.129
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:04.506
And it leads where?

00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:06.675
Another galaxy.

00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:10.512
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.180
Someone placed it there.

00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:14.141
"They?"

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:19.146
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:22.149
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.151
It came along right as we needed it.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.320
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:31.658
- Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:35.162
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.165
The Lazarus missions.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:39.958
Twelve possible worlds...

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.085
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:45.046
...the bravest humans ever to live...

00:32:45.255 --> 00:32:47.883
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:51.219
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.472
They could use hibernation
to stretch that...

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.850
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.896
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:05.400
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.861
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:09.821
Hence the bravery.

00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:13.200
You don't have
the resources to visit all 12.

00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:14.534
No.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.163
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:23.376
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

00:33:23.627 --> 00:33:25.378
And one system shows promise.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:28.256
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.927
One system with three potential worlds?

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.929
No long shot.

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:37.224
Okay.

00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:40.268
So if we find a home...

00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:44.105
...then what?

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.399
That's the long shot.

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:49.945
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.281
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:08.046
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.882
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.884
Both. Plan A.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.178
How do you get it off the ground?

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:19.057
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:23.728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:28.733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:31.194
But you haven't solved it yet.

00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:33.822
That's why there's Plan B.

00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:38.994
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:40.495
This is one way.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:43.331
Plan B: a population bomb.

00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:48.420
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:50.589
How would you raise them?

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.216
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:57.304
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

00:34:58.013 --> 00:35:01.224
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:04.853
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:06.980
This takes care of that.

00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:09.649
But what about the people here?
You just...

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.359
...give up on them?

00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:13.236
My kids?

00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:17.115
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.536
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:24.831
You're asking me to hang everything...

00:35:25.874 --> 00:35:27.208
...on an almost.

00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:30.045
I'm asking you to trust me.

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.799
Find us a new home.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.552
And by the time you return...

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.805
...I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.266
I give you my word.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.489
Go away!

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.209
Murph.

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:12.587
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

00:36:15.382 --> 00:36:18.218
The world was never enough for you,
was it, Coop?

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:22.806
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.600
And it excites me?

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:28.728
No, that does not make it wrong.

00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:30.063
It might.

00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:33.566
Don't trust the right thing done
for the wrong reason.

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.611
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.905
And the foundation's solid.

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:47.080
We farmers sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.623
"Next year."

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.961
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:57.924
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:06.433
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:12.731
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:13.982
I will.

00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.111
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.749
You have to talk to me, Murph.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.336
I need to fix this before I go.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:38.423
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:45.013
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:47.015
She said, "Now...

00:37:48.892 --> 00:37:53.396
...we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

00:37:58.526 --> 00:38:01.029
And I think now I understand
what she meant.

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.536
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:12.332
You said ghosts didn't exist.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.298
That's right, Murph.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.844
Murph, look at me.

00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:30.391
And I can't be your ghost right now.

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.187
I need to exist.

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.732
They chose me.

00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:42.403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:47.534
That's exactly why you can't go.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.705
I figured out the message.

00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:56.292
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:57.836
"Stay."

00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:00.755
It says, "Stay," Dad.

00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:02.882
You don't believe me.

00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:06.386
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:09.597
You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.766
No, I'm coming back.

00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:13.268
When?

00:39:26.281 --> 00:39:28.741
One for you, one for me.

00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:32.287
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.164
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.293
...near a black hole...

00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:43.298
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:46.676
When we get back...

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.178
...we're gonna compare.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:52.015
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:57.770
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

00:39:58.146 --> 00:40:00.481
"What?" Imagine that!

00:40:05.028 --> 00:40:06.154
Aw, Murph....

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.990
You have no idea when you're coming back.

00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:12.285
No idea at all!

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.415
Murph, don't make me leave like this.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:19.208
Come on, Murph!

00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:22.045
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:30.720
Hey...

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.555
I love you.

00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:34.849
Forever. You hear me?

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:38.519
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:45.652
I'm coming back.

00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.047
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:07.715
Just fine.

00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:15.848
I love you, Tom.

00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:18.017
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.395
Look after our place for me, all right?

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:21.854
All right.

00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:30.613
- Can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.741
I'll make sure they bring it back.

00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:37.662
Look after my kids, Donald!

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:53.761
<i>Go for main engine start.
T-minus 10...</i>

00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:56.472
- Dad!
- <i>...nine...</i>

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:57.932
Dad!

00:41:58.599 --> 00:41:59.642
<i>...eight...</i>

00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:01.978
<i>...seven...</i>

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.438
Dad!

00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:04.814
<i>...six...</i>

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.110
<i>...five, main engine start, four...</i>

00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:11.612
<i>...three...</i>

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.406
<i>...two...</i>

00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:16.409
<i>...one. Booster ignition and....</i>

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:28.337
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:35.470
Prepare for stage one separation.

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.846
Stage one.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.645
There is Mach 1.

00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:49.317
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:54.489
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.407
He thinks it relaxes us.

00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:59.452
A giant sarcastic robot.

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:01.662
What a great idea!

00:43:01.871 --> 00:43:04.499
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:05.750
That'd probably help.

00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:09.629
You can use it to find your way back
after I blow you out the airlock.

00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.716
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:15.968
Let's bring it down to 75, please.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.137
Stage two separation.

00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.983
All feeds going manual.

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.693
Going manual.

00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:37.990
- Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.
- Check.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:46.707
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:53.005
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:56.843
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.344
One hundred percent.

00:43:58.678 --> 00:44:00.012
Ex-mites.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.315
It's hard leaving everything.

00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:14.193
My kids. Your father.

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:17.071
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:20.366
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:24.328
Just being honest.

00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:26.747
I don't think you need to be that honest.

00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:29.500
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:32.253
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:35.548
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:38.384
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:39.969
Okay.

00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:43.055
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.979
We are coming up on the <i>Endurance</i>.
Twelve minutes out.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:09.081
Taking control.

00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:15.421
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.560
It's all you, Doyle.

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.581
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.046
I feel good.

00:45:57.255 --> 00:45:58.422
Take us home.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:08.516
- Lock.
- Target locked.

00:46:08.683 --> 00:46:10.434
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

00:46:10.643 --> 00:46:11.686
Good job.

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:46.804
Door's not charging.

00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:48.556
Never mind.

00:47:11.454 --> 00:47:13.039
Cooper, you should have control.

00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.874
Control here.

00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:18.919
<i>Communication with ring module active.</i>

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:33.893
That's initiate.

00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:43.944
- <i>Are we ready to spin?</i>
- Just a sec.

00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:57.708
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:00.586
All right, we're all set.

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.546
All right, let's do it.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.035
<i>Thirty percent of spin.</i>

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:41.252
<i>One G.</i>

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.004
<i>How's gravity treating you back there?</i>

00:48:44.338 --> 00:48:45.506
Well.

00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:50.428
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:52.096
- Yeah.
- You all right?

00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.931
Yeah, I just need a minute.

00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:59.019
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,
or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.355
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.023
Bring a lot.

00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.869
<i>Amelia, be safe.</i>

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:18.539
- <i>Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</i>
- I will, Dad.

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.749
<i>It looks good for your trajectory.</i>

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:24.295
<i>We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>

00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:26.547
That's a lot of Dramamine.

00:49:27.256 --> 00:49:29.717
Look after my family, will you, please, sir?

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:33.053
<i>We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.</i>

00:49:33.554 --> 00:49:37.391
<i>A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.</i>

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:43.564
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:48.277
<i>Old age should burn
and rave at close of day</i>

00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:54.408
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:59.079
<i>Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right</i>

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:02.291
<i>Because their words had forked
No lightning they</i>

00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:06.253
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

00:50:06.921 --> 00:50:11.258
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.527
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:31.946
Okay, thank you.

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:36.784
Here. Pills.

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:40.955
So alone.

00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.457
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:44.959
No, I mean them.

00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:49.713
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:53.551
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:56.845
The human race is going to be...

00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.347
...adrift...

00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:02.059
...desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:04.478
We need to find that rock.

00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:07.481
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.567
...might sustain human life.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.403
Laura Miller's planet is first.

00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:14.822
Laura started our biology program.

00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:22.997
- Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.584
Wolf's a particle physicist.

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:31.213
None of them had families, huh?

00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:35.092
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:38.762
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:40.889
I'm hoping we can surprise three of them.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.017
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.185
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:49.648
He inspired eleven people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:51.483
Scientists, explorers.

00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:55.696
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:57.615
Death, but...

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.701
...not evil.

00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.745
You don't think nature can be evil?

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.789
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:08.167
...not evil.

00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:13.047
Is a lion evil because it rips
a gazelle to shreds?

00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.549
Just what we take with us, then.

00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:17.134
Yeah.

00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:19.595
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:20.888
Even me, huh?

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:23.098
You know what?
We agreed, 90 percent.

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:24.391
There you go.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.102
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:31.398
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:41.241
Hey, TARS?
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:43.243
Eight months to Mars.

00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:48.082
Then counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing's changed on that.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.417
Just let me ask you something.

00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:56.131
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:00.678
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:02.096
I wouldn't know.

00:53:02.304 --> 00:53:05.307
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:07.851
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:12.272
But not a poker face, Slick.

00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:25.869
Hey, guys.

00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:29.373
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:32.543
<i>So I wanted to give you an update.</i>

00:53:34.294 --> 00:53:36.714
<i>The Earth looks amazing from here.</i>

00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:40.592
<i>You can't see any of the dust.</i>

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.556
<i>I really hope you guys are doing great.</i>

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:50.144
<i>I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.</i>

00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:52.730
<i>Know that I love you.</i>

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:56.483
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.033
You must be Donald.

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.412
Hello, Murph.

00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:11.165
Why are you in my dad's truck?

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.959
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.879
He sent you a message.

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.925
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:26.221
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:29.975
Murph is a bright spark.

00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:33.479
Maybe I should fan the flame.

00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:36.190
She's already making fools of her teachers.

00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:39.276
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:43.197
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:47.910
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

00:55:27.908 --> 00:55:32.913
<i>As far as school goes, the administration
wants me to repeat plant pathology. Which sucks.</i>

00:55:33.413 --> 00:55:36.625
<i>But they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.</i>

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:42.297
<i>All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.</i>

00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:47.761
<i>Sorry, Coop.</i>

00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:52.933
<i>I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.</i>

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.185
<i>I'll try again next time.</i>

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.702
You all right, Rom?

00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:15.789
This gets to me, Cooper.

00:56:15.998 --> 00:56:17.791
This. This.

00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:21.086
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:25.299
...out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.093
You know that some of the finest...

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:32.139
...solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:35.893
They don't know.
And if they go overboard, they're done.

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:39.605
We're explorers, Rom.

00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:42.816
This is our boat.

00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:44.151
Here.

00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:13.013
This is from the relay probe?

00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:15.223
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:18.727
This is the wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:22.147
...we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.566
Oh, yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:25.859
Exactly.

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:30.530
So we got a pretty good idea what we're
gonna find on the other side, huh?

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:32.950
Navigationally.

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:38.163
<i>Guys? We'll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.</i>

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:45.587
Hey, Coop?

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:48.215
Can we stop the spinning?

00:57:48.382 --> 00:57:49.424
Why?

00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:51.969
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

00:57:53.679 --> 00:57:54.930
All right.

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:56.181
Thanks.

00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:03.939
There, that's it! That's the wormhole!

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:05.857
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:07.567
It's a sphere.

00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:11.655
Of course it is.
You thought it would just be a hole?

00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:15.951
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they....

00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.579
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:24.126
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:25.961
But it's too far, right?

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:31.967
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.802
...a higher dimension.

00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:35.512
Okay, so...

00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:39.766
...to show that, they've turned
three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:43.854
...which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:46.314
What's a circle in three dimensions?

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:49.026
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:50.944
A spherical hole.

00:58:51.486 --> 00:58:54.322
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:59.411
I'm not thanking anybody until
we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.045
Any trick to this, Doyle?

00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.048
No one knows.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.848
The others made it, right?

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:23.560
At least some of them.

00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:58.678
Everybody ready to say good-bye
to our solar system?

00:59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.556
To our galaxy.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.559
Here we go.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:40.595
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:45.225
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.445
What is that?

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.658
I think it's them.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.827
Distorting space-time.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.038
Don't!

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.276
What was that?

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.780
The first handshake.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.491
We're...

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.453
We're here.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:09.017
So the lost communications came through.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.062
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:15.815
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.153
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.822
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.199
Transmitter failure?

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.327
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.371
But Miller's still looks good, right?

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.790
Because she's coming up fast.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.251
With one complication.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:37.629
The planet is much closer
to Gargantua than we thought.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.507
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.842
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:46.346
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.515
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:51.935
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.524
Look, I could swing around
that neutron star to decelerate.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.526
No, it's not that. It's time.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:04.239
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:05.991
How bad?

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.744
Every hour we spend on that planet will be...

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.789
...seven years back on Earth.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:14.708
Jesus!

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.710
Well, that's relativity, folks.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.547
Well, we can't just drop
down there without....

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.590
Cooper, we have a mission.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.385
Yeah, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.763
...to find a planet that can habitate
the people living on Earth now.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.766
You can't think about your family.
You have to think bigger.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.145
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:39.524
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.485
No. It doesn't.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.487
That's why there's Plan B.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.866
Okay. Cooper's right.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.995
We need to think of time as a resource,
like oxygen or food. Going down will cost us.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.457
All right, look.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.253
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.464
And Edmunds', it's even further.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:06.885
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics....

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.262
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:14.434
And just think about the resources, including time,
that would be spent trying to get back here.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.811
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:21.358
...how far off from Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:23.234
Just back from the cusp.

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:26.237
Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.281
- Right.
- Okay.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.951
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.288
Instead of taking the <i>Endurance</i>
into orbit around Miller's planet...

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:38.333
...which would conserve fuel,
but lose a lot of time...

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.670
...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.256
...outside of this time shift, to here?

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.259
Then we take the Ranger down,
get Miller, get her samples.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:51.137
We come back, analyze, debrief.
We're in, we're out.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.640
We lose a little fuel but save a lot of time.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.517
- That'll work.
- That's good.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.520
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.147
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.691
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.404
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could research gravity.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:10.532
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.409
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.247
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.958
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.209
...Dr. Brand.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.465
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:31.886
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.139
Detach.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.399
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- <i>It's unbelievable.</i>

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.821
A literal heart of darkness.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.494
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.622
...the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:03.126
- And we can't get anything from it?
- <i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.711
Not even light.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:08.506
- <i>The answer's there, just no way to see it.</i>
- There's Miller's planet.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:12.510
Good-bye, Ranger.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.484
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.777
- Should we use thrusters to slow?
- No.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.573
I'm gonna use the Ranger's
aerodynamics to save some fuel.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:34.908
Air brake?

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:38.661
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:42.081
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.016
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:03.603
The only time I went down was when
a machine was easing at the wrong time.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.940
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:08.942
- Cooper, it's too fast!
- I got this.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:17.784
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.289
Here we go.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:27.877
It's just water!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.880
The stuff of life.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.674
Twelve hundred meters.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.051
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.720
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.682
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.018
Seven hundred.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.147
On, my cue, CASE.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.152
Five hundred meters.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.663
Fire!

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:18.261
Very graceful.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.554
No.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.265
But very efficient.

01:08:24.726 --> 01:08:26.894
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

01:08:27.186 --> 01:08:29.022
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:32.692
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.053
This way.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.641
About 200 meters.

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.777
The gravity's punishing.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.821
Been floating through space too long?

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:21.074
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.742
Come on.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.873
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.795
If the signal's coming from here, then....

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.597
Her beacon.

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:53.773
Wreckage.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.608
<i>Where's the rest?</i>

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.610
Towards the mountains!

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.282
Those aren't mountains.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.285
They're waves.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.293
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.796
<i>That one's moving away from us.</i>

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.971
We need the recorder.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.316
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:40.737
We're not leaving without her data.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.280
Get back here now!

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.198
<i>We do not have time!</i>

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.868
The second wave is coming!
We're in a swell.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.537
No, I got it.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.831
Get your ass back to the Ranger, now!

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.880
Brand, get back here, now!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.009
No, Cooper, go. I can't make it.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.845
- <i>Go!</i>
- CASE, go get her.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.643
- Go!
- Get up, Brand!

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.062
Go, go! Go!

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.484
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.659
CASE has her! Get back here, Doyle!

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:32.622
Come on!

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:36.876
Get to the hatch!

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:42.924
Go, go! Go!

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.555
Shit.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.891
Manually overriding inside hatch!

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.562
Cooper! Wait!

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:07.573
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:42.358
Holy shit.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.114
Hang on!

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:20.646
CASE, what's the problem?

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:23.190
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:25.484
Goddamn it!

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:30.323
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:35.202
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.332
I was trying to do the right thing!

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.500
Can you tell that to Doyle?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.047
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.091
The stuff of life, huh?

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.136
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:54.388
A lot. Decades.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.855
What happened to Miller?

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:06.317
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:09.153
...broken up by a wave soon after impact.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.156
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.409
Because of the time slippage.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:21.040
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.210
She probably just died minutes ago.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:28.547
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.092
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.806
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:40.393
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.103
Well, not far enough!

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:45.940
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone on Earth to save.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.654
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.119
Is there any possibility...

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:02.123
...some kind of way we can
all jump in a black hole?

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.083
Gain back the years?

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.168
Don't shake your head at me.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.129
Time is relative, okay?

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:11.465
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.135
...it can't run backwards. It just can't.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.764
The only thing that can move
across dimensions, like time, is gravity.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.643
Okay.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:28.315
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.443
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.820
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:35.990
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can....

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.453
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.206
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.875
To them...

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:50.463
...the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:53.632
...a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.136
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.140
But you knew about relativity.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.436
Brand...

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:12.234
...my daughter was 10 years old.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.654
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.908
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.534
No.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:26.373
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:31.045
And that is that you want
to make sure your children feel safe.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:35.841
And it rules out telling a 10 year old
that the world is ending.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.678
Cooper?

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.684
- How long for the engines?
- A minute or two.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:48.229
We don't have it. Helmets on!

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.776
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.487
CASE, blow cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.405
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.032
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:07.164
Engines up!

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.528
Hello, Rom.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.655
I've waited years.

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:42.575
How many years?

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:49.248
- By now it must be....
- Twenty-three years, four months, eight days.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.712
Doyle?

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.054
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:06.932
Reality's different.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.143
And Miller?

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.730
There's nothing here for us.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:16.984
Why didn't you sleep?

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:22.031
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.534
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:29.205
I learned what I could from the black hole...

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.999
...but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.376
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.712
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:39.173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:44.929
We've got years of messages stored.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.263
Cooper.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.558
<i>Messages span 23 years.</i>

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.270
Play it from the beginning.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.150
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.278
<i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.824
<i>Finished second in school.</i>

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.828
<i>Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.</i>

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.957
<i>Pulled me down, but second's not bad.</i>

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.293
<i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:22.800
<i>I met another girl, Dad.</i>

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.346
<i>I really think this is the one.</i>

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.225
<i>Name's Lois. That's her right there.</i>

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.272
<i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:39.608
<i>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</i>

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.360
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.612
<i>Look at this!</i>

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.948
<i>You're a grandpa.</i>

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.034
<i>His name's Jesse.</i>

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:54.290
<i>I wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says maybe next time.</i>

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:59.378
<i>Donald says he's already earned the "great" part,
so we just leave it at that.</i>

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.383
<i>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</i>

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.760
<i>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</i>

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:08.971
<i>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</i>

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.890
<i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.310
<i>Just...</i>

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.522
<i>...what with Jesse and all.</i>

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:27.364
<i>Grandpa died last week.</i>

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.868
<i>We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...</i>

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:32.828
<i>...Jesse.</i>

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.790
<i>Which is where we would have
buried you if you'd ever...</i>

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.043
<i>...come back.</i>

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.796
<i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.175
<i>We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.</i>

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.805
<i>You aren't listening to this, I know that.</i>

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:57.686
<i>All these messages are just, like...</i>

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.524
<i>...drifting out there in the darkness.</i>

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.944
<i>Lois says that...</i>

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:09.490
<i>...I have to let you go.</i>

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.700
<i>And...</i>

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:13.202
<i>...so...</i>

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.625
<i>...I guess I'm letting you go.</i>

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.253
<i>I don't know where you are, Dad...</i>

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.507
<i>...but I hope that you're at peace.</i>

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.385
<i>Good-bye.</i>

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:44.233
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.153
Hey, Murph.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.322
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.495
<i>I never made one of these
when you were responding...</i>

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:59.039
<i>...because I was so mad
at you for leaving.</i>

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.169
<i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.633
<i>...seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.</i>

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.557
<i>But today's my birthday.</i>

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:23.397
<i>And it's a special one,
because you told me....</i>

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:31.864
<i>You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.</i>

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.660
<i>And today I'm the age
you were when you left.</i>

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.666
<i>So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.</i>

01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.809
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just
that I've never seen you in here before.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.312
I've never been in here before.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:08.192
I talk to Amelia all the time.

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.027
It helps.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:13.280
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't.

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.116
I just had something I needed to get out.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.785
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:23.165
There are so many reasons their communications
might not be getting through.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:24.750
I know, professor.

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.295
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.882
Them never coming back or...

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.220
...coming back to find we've failed.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.888
Then let's succeed.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:39.973
So...

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.686
...back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.190
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.194
It only has to work once, Murph.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.326
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.495
We've done well for the world here...

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:06.542
...whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.503
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.089
I'm an old physicist.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.008
I'm afraid of time.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.350
Time.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.062
You're afraid of time.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.650
We've been trying to solve the equation...

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.278
...without changing
the assumption about time.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.154
- And?
- And that means...

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:40.742
...each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:43.120
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.372
Are you calling my life's work...

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.082
...nonsense, Murph?

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.334
No, I'm saying you've been trying to...

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:53.380
...finish it with one arm... No, with both arms.
...tied behind your back.

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.467
And I don't understand why.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.262
I'm an old man, Murph.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.765
Can we take this point up at another time?

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.101
I want to talk to my daughter.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.689
<i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.693
<i>...we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.</i>

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:20.115
<i>We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.</i>

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:25.454
<i>We must think not as individuals
but as a species.</i>

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.793
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.756
TARS kept the <i>Endurance</i>
right where we needed her.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.634
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.471
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.306
...we have to choose.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:46.600
But how?

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.353
They're both promising.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:55.317
Edmunds' data is better,
but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting.

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:58.487
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds' data would have soured.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.907
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:05.243
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.454
And...

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:10.374
...I believe Edmunds' is the better prospect.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:13.919
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:19.049
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:23.679
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.764
Because of the black hole?

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:29.059
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.561
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.606
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.069
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.279
We need to go further afield.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:44.241
You once said that Dr. Mann...

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.993
...was the best of us.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:50.455
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.791
And yet here he is.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:57.796
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us to...

01:26:58.004 --> 01:26:59.798
...come to his planet.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.636
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:08.432
- We should vote.
- If we vote, there's something you should know.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:10.684
Brand?

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.436
He has a right to know.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.646
That has nothing to do with it.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.816
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.652
- Is that true?
- Yes.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.533
And that makes me want
to follow my heart.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:33.665
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.333
You're a scientist, Brand.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.960
So listen to me...

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:42.507
...when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.844
...observable, powerful.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.556
It has to mean something.

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:53.935
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing....

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:57.856
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

01:27:58.523 --> 01:27:59.566
None.

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:03.445
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.697
...yet understand.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:09.326
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:14.706
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.669
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:22.714
...who I know is probably dead.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:26.343
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:29.387
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:35.560
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.234
All right, Cooper...

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:45.403
...yes...

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:50.075
...the tiniest possibility of seeing
Wolf again excites me.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:52.410
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:55.288
Honestly, Amelia...

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.250
...it might.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.884
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:27.821
We'll lose about a third again.
But next year...

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:32.951
...I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.620
What happened to Nelson?

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.962
<i>Murph, would you like some more soufflé?</i>

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.299
I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:50.176
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:56.016
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.684
I need to get back.

01:29:57.934 --> 01:30:00.312
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:01.771
I need to....

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.192
Too many memories.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.613
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.204
The dust.

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:23.335
Lois, I have a friend who...

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.337
...could look at his lungs.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:46.149
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:49.736
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.238
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:56.952
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:00.246
Your fuel calculations are based
on a return journey.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.459
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.878
...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:10.882
Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:14.344
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.388
...and the future of the human race.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:19.599
I trust you'll be as objective then.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.483
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:30.193
We were trying to reach you.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.200
Murph.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:39.703
I'm here, professor.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.747
I let you all down.

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:46.418
No, you got us so far! Real close.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.046
I'll finish what you started.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:52.424
Good, good Murph.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.012
You had faith...

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.514
...all those...

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.267
...all those years.

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.061
I...

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.856
I asked you to have faith.

01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:12.402
I wanted you to believe...

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:15.780
...that your father...

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:20.577
...would come back.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.078
I do, professor.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:25.206
Forgive me, Murph.

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.959
There's nothing to forgive.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:31.671
I...

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.090
I lied, Murph.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.261
I lied to you.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:47.812
There was no need for him to...

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:50.899
...to come back.

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:56.821
There is no way to help us.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.157
But Plan A....

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:02.827
All this. All these people.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:05.747
And the equation.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:11.586
Did my father know?

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.008
Did he leave me?

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:22.013
Do...

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.516
...not...

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:26.726
...go...

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.521
...gentle....

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:32.690
No.

01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:35.401
No!

01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:38.321
You can't leave.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:39.948
You... No.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:45.829
<i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that
your father died today. He had no pain.</i>

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:47.956
He was at peace.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.708
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.973
Brand, did you know?

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:09.060
<i>He told you, right?</i>

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.314
<i>You knew.</i>

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:17.026
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.867
<i>You left us here.</i>

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.744
<i>To suffocate.</i>

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:30.248
<i>To starve.</i>

01:34:57.609 --> 01:34:58.943
Frozen cloud.

01:37:23.379 --> 01:37:24.714
It's okay.

01:37:24.964 --> 01:37:26.466
It's okay.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.682
It's okay.

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:42.106
Pray you never learn...

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:46.611
...just how good it can be
to see another face.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.538
I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with, but...

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.041
...after so long, I had none.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:04.545
My supplies were completely exhausted.

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:10.259
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.891
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:18.684
Lazarus.

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:24.232
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:27.360
So far, surely.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:32.865
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

01:38:36.702 --> 01:38:38.704
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

01:38:39.789 --> 01:38:41.457
Tell us about your world.

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:46.796
Our world, we hope.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.802
Our world is cold...

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:54.429
...stark...

01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:58.182
...but undeniably beautiful.

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:03.688
<i>The days are 67 hours long, cold.</i>

01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:09.026
<i>The nights are...</i>

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:11.612
<i>...67 far colder hours.</i>

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:21.706
<i>The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.</i>

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.959
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:28.963
...and the air has too much ammonia
to breathe for more than a few minutes...

01:39:29.338 --> 01:39:33.509
...but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:35.553
...the chlorine dissipates.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:39.640
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:41.476
To organics.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:44.145
Possibly even to life.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.898
We might be sharing this world.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.358
These readings are from the surface?

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:52.737
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:56.449
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

01:39:56.657 --> 01:40:00.578
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:03.498
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:07.251
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:11.422
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:14.091
...used his power source
to keep the mission going.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:16.761
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down!

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.846
Would you like me to look at him?

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.766
No. No. He needs a human touch.

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:26.187
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:28.981
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:43.496
<i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died.</i>

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:45.831
<i>He had no pain.</i>

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.461
<i>He was at peace.</i>

01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:54.382
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:57.969
Is that Murph?

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:00.846
She's.... She's grown.

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:02.723
<i>Brand, did you know?</i>

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.560
<i>He told you, right?</i>

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:09.897
<i>You knew.</i>

01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:13.150
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:15.861
<i>You left us here.</i>

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:19.490
<i>To suffocate.</i>

01:41:21.617 --> 01:41:22.952
<i>To starve.</i>

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:28.040
<i>Did my father know too?</i>

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:31.919
<i>Dad?</i>

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:35.590
<i>I just want to know...</i>

01:41:37.008 --> 01:41:39.093
<i>...if you left me here to die.</i>

01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:43.514
<i>I just have to know.</i>

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.438
Cooper, my...

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.858
My father dedicated...

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:59.238
...his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.116
I do.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:09.915
He never even hoped to get
the people off Earth?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.168
No.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.134
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:24.138
Amelia, your father solved
his equation before I even left.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.474
Then why wouldn't he use it?

01:42:26.682 --> 01:42:30.603
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:32.730
More? More what?

01:42:33.022 --> 01:42:35.900
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.

01:42:36.108 --> 01:42:38.194
Laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:39.737
Romilly, is that true?

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:44.867
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:47.745
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:49.413
...behind the horizon.

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.833
That's why we call it a black hole.

01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:56.504
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon....

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:58.589
We can't, Coop.

01:42:58.881 --> 01:43:01.217
Some things aren't meant to be known.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:05.596
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:07.264
Plan B. A colony.

01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:09.141
Why not tell people?

01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:13.771
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

01:43:13.979 --> 01:43:17.942
...to get people to work together to save
the species instead of themselves.

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.443
Or their children.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.653
Bullshit.

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.698
Never would've come unless
you believed you would save them.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:26.909
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:29.495
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:33.290
...those we know, but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.167
But the lie.

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:40.881
That monstrous lie?

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:43.300
Unforgivable.

01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:45.052
And he knew that.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:50.057
He was prepared to destroy his own
humanity in order to save the species.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:52.727
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:59.024
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.652
Because in his fucking arrogance...

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.155
...he declared their case hopeless.

01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:06.323
I'm sorry, Cooper...

01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:08.367
...their case is hopeless.

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:10.411
No. No.

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:12.747
We are the future.

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.335
Cooper, what can I do?

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:23.382
Let me go home.

01:44:23.966 --> 01:44:25.885
You're absolutely positive?

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.013
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.308
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.270
Okay, how do you find the other half?

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:38.481
Out there? A black hole.

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:41.525
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:44.528
I'm not sure you can.

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:49.116
God, they just pack up and leave.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.620
What are they hoping to find?

01:44:53.204 --> 01:44:54.246
Survival.

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:03.130
Damn it.

01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:09.845
Murph, don't people have the right to know?

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:14.517
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:18.020
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:21.482
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

01:45:22.107 --> 01:45:23.192
So...

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:26.278
...do you have an idea?

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.322
A feeling.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:33.744
<i>I told you about my ghost.</i>

01:45:35.746 --> 01:45:37.915
<i>My dad thought I called it a ghost...</i>

01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:39.917
...because I was scared of it.

01:45:43.379 --> 01:45:44.713
But I was never scared of it.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:49.593
<i>I called it a ghost because it felt....</i>

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.681
It felt like a person.

01:45:56.225 --> 01:45:57.893
It was trying to tell me something.

01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:03.858
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

01:46:04.316 --> 01:46:06.235
...somehow, in that room.

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:08.529
So I have to find it.

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:13.701
We're running out of time.

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:17.580
<i>What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.957
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:21.625
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

01:46:21.834 --> 01:46:23.919
I have a suggestion for your return journey.

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.797
- Yeah, what?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:30.134
I'm going home, Rom.

01:46:30.342 --> 01:46:33.679
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:36.265
There's a chance for people on Earth.

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:40.019
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:44.064
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:47.693
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:52.239
...something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:56.911
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

01:46:57.244 --> 01:47:00.205
So, what's to say there isn't
some way that the probe...

01:47:00.414 --> 01:47:03.250
...can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.712
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.715
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.009
TARS is the obvious candidate.

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:14.720
I've already told him what to look for.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:17.640
I'd need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:19.141
You'd do this for us?

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:23.228
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:25.606
Your cue light's broken.

01:47:25.814 --> 01:47:27.316
I'm not joking.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:33.197
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

01:47:33.364 --> 01:47:35.699
I don't want to disturb his archival functions.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:37.368
I'll supervise.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:38.744
All right.

01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:43.540
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

01:47:43.749 --> 01:47:46.168
Once those have landed
you don't want to move them.

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:48.879
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

01:47:49.088 --> 01:47:51.715
...these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

01:47:51.924 --> 01:47:54.802
CASE is headed down with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:57.805
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

01:47:59.723 --> 01:48:02.810
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:04.269
Okay, then.

01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:06.730
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:08.440
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:10.067
Follow me.

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:12.903
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

01:48:13.195 --> 01:48:14.405
Roger that, Cooper.

01:48:20.703 --> 01:48:23.747
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

01:48:25.582 --> 01:48:28.335
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:32.840
...that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:38.929
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

01:48:39.555 --> 01:48:41.306
<i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>

01:48:42.558 --> 01:48:45.561
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

01:48:45.936 --> 01:48:50.941
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:52.693
I'm going home.

01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:04.204
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

01:49:04.621 --> 01:49:09.084
...I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:13.088
That emotion is at the foundation...

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:16.759
...of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.311
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

01:49:37.863 --> 01:49:39.865
Mom lets me play in here.

01:49:41.617 --> 01:49:43.035
I don't touch your stuff.

01:50:13.982 --> 01:50:15.651
Just take this gently.

01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:24.159
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions, don't you?

01:50:24.785 --> 01:50:29.414
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.543
Our survival instinct is our single greatest...

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:36.338
...source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.

01:50:37.047 --> 01:50:38.382
A father...

01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:41.885
...with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:47.724
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

01:50:49.434 --> 01:50:51.895
Your children. Their faces.

01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:54.648
At the moment of death,
your mind will push...

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:56.692
...a little bit harder to survive.

01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:58.443
For them.

01:50:59.278 --> 01:51:00.571
Deep breath.

01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:06.618
I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:09.246
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:10.998
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:51:19.548 --> 01:51:21.008
What's taking so long?

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:24.052
I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

01:51:24.303 --> 01:51:25.804
I don't understand.

01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:33.854
It's funny.

01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:37.566
When I left Earth...

01:51:38.567 --> 01:51:40.652
...I thought I was prepared to die.

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:44.031
The truth is...

01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:51.246
...I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:56.251
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:57.502
Let's go.

01:52:05.928 --> 01:52:08.680
All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.978
What is this?

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:19.233
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:21.902
We'll need it to complete the mission...

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:25.656
...once the others realize
what this place isn't.

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:28.700
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

01:52:29.159 --> 01:52:30.410
I'm sorry!

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.923
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

01:52:43.215 --> 01:52:46.718
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:50.138
- Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:52.391
Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:56.603
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:59.856
You faked all the data?

01:53:01.566 --> 01:53:02.651
Yeah.

01:53:06.655 --> 01:53:08.282
There's no surface?

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:09.533
No.

01:53:10.659 --> 01:53:12.577
I tried to do my duty...

01:53:12.828 --> 01:53:17.833
...but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:22.254
And I resisted the temptation for years...

01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:24.965
...but I knew that...

01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:28.135
...if I just pressed that button, then...

01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:30.429
...somebody would come and save me.

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:32.973
You fucking coward.

01:53:33.807 --> 01:53:34.850
Yes.

01:53:40.272 --> 01:53:41.315
Yes.

01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:44.276
Yes.

01:53:45.527 --> 01:53:46.611
Yes.

01:53:58.081 --> 01:54:02.627
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

01:54:03.128 --> 01:54:05.380
And we go live underground with you?

01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:07.591
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

01:54:07.758 --> 01:54:11.178
Dad's not coming back.
He never was. It's up to me.

01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:13.221
You're gonna save everybody?

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:16.266
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.769
Dad just abandoned us!

01:54:19.394 --> 01:54:21.313
He left us here to die.

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.690
Nobody's going with you.

01:54:27.402 --> 01:54:30.113
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

01:54:33.116 --> 01:54:34.409
Get out.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:36.787
And don't come back.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.335
You can keep my stuff.

01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:55.639
Stop it!

01:54:58.683 --> 01:54:59.935
No. No!

01:55:01.353 --> 01:55:04.189
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

01:55:05.023 --> 01:55:07.192
Those are the best odds
I've had in years.

01:55:27.546 --> 01:55:29.297
Don't judge me, Cooper.

01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:32.300
You were never tested like I was.

01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:34.344
Few men have been.

01:55:42.727 --> 01:55:44.062
You tried your best.

01:55:53.405 --> 01:55:55.240
You're feeling it, aren't you?

01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:58.285
The survival instinct.

01:55:59.202 --> 01:56:03.540
That's what drove me.
It's what drives all of us.
And it's what will save us.

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:08.044
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

01:56:13.216 --> 01:56:16.761
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:19.764
I thought I could, but I can't.

01:56:20.932 --> 01:56:23.018
I'm here. I'm here for you.

01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:25.353
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

01:56:26.146 --> 01:56:27.481
I'm right here.

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:30.650
You're not alone.

01:56:40.368 --> 01:56:42.037
Do you see your children?

01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:46.458
It's okay.

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:49.169
They're right there with you.

01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:55.800
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

01:56:56.468 --> 01:56:57.969
Do you remember?

01:57:00.347 --> 01:57:03.016
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:07.771
<i>Old age should burn and rave</i>

01:57:07.979 --> 01:57:09.481
<i>At close of day</i>

01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:13.652
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

01:57:38.093 --> 01:57:39.844
Brand! Help!

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:41.888
- <i>Help!</i>
- Cooper?

01:57:48.603 --> 01:57:49.813
CASE!

01:57:50.188 --> 01:57:51.481
No air.

01:57:52.315 --> 01:57:53.525
Ammonia.

01:57:54.609 --> 01:57:57.028
Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.155
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go!

01:57:59.364 --> 01:58:01.199
And away!

01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:15.380
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:18.008
Breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:23.513
There's a security lockout, sir.

01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:26.975
It requires a person to access function.

01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:33.523
It's all yours, sir.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:43.199
<i>Try not to breathe.</i>

01:58:44.242 --> 01:58:45.744
<i>We're coming right now.</i>

01:58:46.036 --> 01:58:48.079
<i>CASE, come on! Come on!</i>

01:58:48.246 --> 01:58:51.041
<i>We got to go faster, CASE! Faster, faster!</i>

01:58:55.545 --> 01:58:57.255
Hang in there.

01:59:03.762 --> 01:59:07.057
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

01:59:26.076 --> 01:59:27.619
Cooper! Cooper!

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.079
I'm here!

01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:54.312
This data makes no sense.

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:03.988
I'm sorry.

02:00:04.322 --> 02:00:06.908
- What?
- Mann was lying!

02:00:14.666 --> 02:00:16.459
Go. Go.

02:00:17.544 --> 02:00:18.586
Romilly.

02:00:18.962 --> 02:00:20.004
<i>Romilly!</i>

02:00:20.422 --> 02:00:22.757
<i>Do you read me, Romilly?</i>

02:00:23.341 --> 02:00:25.343
Step back, professor! Step back!

02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:35.854
<i>- Romilly....
- Romilly, do you read me?</i>

02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:40.191
Keep watch!

02:00:41.359 --> 02:00:42.485
Lois?

02:00:42.986 --> 02:00:45.572
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

02:00:46.865 --> 02:00:50.285
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

02:00:53.163 --> 02:00:54.205
Romilly?

02:00:54.372 --> 02:00:56.958
Dr. Brand? Cooper?
There's been an explosion.

02:00:57.584 --> 02:00:59.377
Dr. Mann's compound.

02:01:26.988 --> 02:01:29.032
TARS, ten o'clock!

02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:37.373
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.962
Romilly did not survive.

02:01:44.088 --> 02:01:45.548
I could not save him.

02:01:45.757 --> 02:01:47.467
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her from here.

02:01:47.675 --> 02:01:50.386
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

02:01:50.595 --> 02:01:53.598
If he takes control of that ship,
we're dead.

02:01:54.808 --> 02:01:57.936
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

02:01:59.771 --> 02:02:02.273
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Wait by the car.

02:02:10.114 --> 02:02:14.202
Give me your bag. Get in the back seat.
Get in the back seat now!

02:02:19.958 --> 02:02:21.960
<i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>

02:02:22.502 --> 02:02:24.546
Dr. Mann, please respond!

02:02:24.712 --> 02:02:26.923
He doesn't know the <i>Endurance</i>
docking procedure.

02:02:27.090 --> 02:02:29.717
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

02:02:30.802 --> 02:02:31.845
Nice.

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:35.014
- <i>What's your trust setting, TARS?</i>
- Lower than yours apparently.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:41.896
<i>Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.</i>

02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:43.398
<i>Please res...</i>

02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:45.001
<i>Auto-docking sequence withheld.</i>

02:03:45.293 --> 02:03:46.961
- Override.
- <i>Unauthorized.</i>

02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:49.964
Override.

02:03:50.465 --> 02:03:52.342
<i>Unauthorized.</i>

02:03:56.346 --> 02:04:00.516
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking. Please res...

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.479
Moving slowly toward the <i>Endurance</i>.

02:05:11.087 --> 02:05:12.588
<i>Imperfect contact.</i>

02:05:12.922 --> 02:05:14.841
- Override.
- <i>Hatch lockout.</i>

02:05:22.598 --> 02:05:25.184
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

02:05:26.978 --> 02:05:28.229
Dr. Mann, do not...

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:52.712
<i>Hatch lockout disengaged.</i>

02:06:01.262 --> 02:06:04.766
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat,
do not open the hatch.

02:06:05.099 --> 02:06:06.726
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

02:06:06.934 --> 02:06:09.979
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

02:06:35.588 --> 02:06:38.049
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

02:06:44.013 --> 02:06:46.641
Okay, pull back.
Retro thrusters, everything we've got!

02:06:46.849 --> 02:06:48.518
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

02:06:48.726 --> 02:06:52.980
Relay my transmission to the on board computer
and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.

02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:54.232
Dr. Mann...

02:06:56.859 --> 02:06:59.737
<i>I repeat, do not open the inner hatch.</i>

02:06:59.904 --> 02:07:00.947
Brand?

02:07:01.697 --> 02:07:03.866
<i>I don't know what he said to you...</i>

02:07:04.075 --> 02:07:06.577
...but I am taking command
of the <i>Endurance</i>.

02:07:07.036 --> 02:07:09.205
<i>Then we can talk about
completing the mission.</i>

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:14.210
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

02:07:15.002 --> 02:07:17.004
This is not about my life.

02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:20.883
Or Cooper's life. This is about all mankind.

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:22.969
There is a moment...

02:07:29.225 --> 02:07:30.560
It is not sa...

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:39.902
Oh, my God.

02:07:58.212 --> 02:08:02.175
- There's no point using your fuel to chase...
- Analyze the <i>Endurance's</i> spin.

02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:09.682
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

02:08:14.312 --> 02:08:16.981
<i>Endurance</i> rotation is 67.... Sixty-eight RPM.

02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:19.650
Get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:21.319
- It's not possible.
- No...

02:08:22.028 --> 02:08:23.362
...it's necessary.

02:08:34.957 --> 02:08:37.126
<i>Endurance</i> is hitting stratosphere!

02:08:41.214 --> 02:08:43.216
She's got no heat shield.

02:08:46.344 --> 02:08:48.095
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.690
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

02:09:01.234 --> 02:09:03.611
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

02:09:03.819 --> 02:09:06.364
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:14.956
<i>Endurance</i> is starting to heat.

02:09:15.164 --> 02:09:16.457
Twenty feet out.

02:09:16.832 --> 02:09:19.043
I need three degrees starboard.

02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:21.128
Ten feet out.

02:09:21.379 --> 02:09:23.965
Cooper, we are lined up.

02:09:24.215 --> 02:09:25.716
Initiating spin!

02:10:07.216 --> 02:10:08.426
Come on, TARS.

02:10:16.684 --> 02:10:18.185
Come on, TARS!

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.949
- <i>We are locked, Cooper.</i>
- Locked. Easing up!

02:10:39.582 --> 02:10:40.916
Easy.

02:10:42.084 --> 02:10:43.419
Easy.

02:10:49.258 --> 02:10:50.760
Retro thrusters!

02:10:58.726 --> 02:11:00.227
Main engines on.

02:11:05.983 --> 02:11:08.694
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:18.371
Killing main engines!

02:11:19.622 --> 02:11:21.290
Okay, we're out of orbit.

02:11:28.631 --> 02:11:31.509
Okay. And for our next trick!

02:11:33.344 --> 02:11:37.181
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

02:11:38.099 --> 02:11:39.141
Oh, shit.

02:11:39.642 --> 02:11:41.435
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

02:12:31.402 --> 02:12:33.737
<i>Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.</i>

02:12:35.072 --> 02:12:36.991
<i>Shall I use main engines?</i>

02:12:37.199 --> 02:12:38.242
No.

02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:41.078
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

02:12:49.879 --> 02:12:52.756
- Give it to me.
- There's good news and there's bad news.

02:12:53.007 --> 02:12:56.677
I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:08.564
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. All good.

02:13:08.772 --> 02:13:09.815
Good.

02:13:10.232 --> 02:13:13.652
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:16.322
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

02:13:16.489 --> 02:13:18.949
...but we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

02:13:19.116 --> 02:13:20.451
What about fuel?

02:13:20.868 --> 02:13:23.370
Not enough. But I have a plan.

02:13:23.996 --> 02:13:28.000
<i>We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.</i>

02:13:28.292 --> 02:13:31.712
<i>Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.</i>

02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:34.381
<i>- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.</i>

02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:36.967
<i>I'm gonna take us just
inside the critical orbit.</i>

02:13:37.134 --> 02:13:39.970
<i>- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...</i>

02:13:40.137 --> 02:13:41.805
...about relativity right now.

02:13:46.435 --> 02:13:48.020
I'm sorry, Cooper.

02:13:51.065 --> 02:13:54.318
<i>Once we've gathered enough speed
around Gargantua...</i>

02:13:54.652 --> 02:13:56.487
<i>...we use Lander 1...</i>

02:13:56.987 --> 02:13:59.281
<i>...and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...</i>

02:14:00.115 --> 02:14:02.451
<i>...push us out of the black hole's gravity.</i>

02:14:04.787 --> 02:14:07.414
<i>The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed...</i>

02:14:07.623 --> 02:14:09.959
<i>...so we'll have to control manually.</i>

02:14:11.168 --> 02:14:14.046
<i>Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...</i>

02:14:14.296 --> 02:14:16.632
...and get sucked right into that black hole.

02:14:17.299 --> 02:14:21.262
- Why does TARS have to detach?
- We must shed the weight to escape the gravity.

02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:22.805
<i>Newton's third law.</i>

02:14:23.055 --> 02:14:27.351
<i>The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.</i>

02:14:27.643 --> 02:14:30.604
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

02:14:30.813 --> 02:14:34.567
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

02:14:34.858 --> 02:14:36.193
<i>Cooper, you asshole!</i>

02:14:36.485 --> 02:14:38.487
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

02:14:38.821 --> 02:14:41.073
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:43.784
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

02:14:43.993 --> 02:14:47.288
<i>If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...</i>

02:14:47.496 --> 02:14:49.331
<i>...they might still make it.</i>

02:14:50.374 --> 02:14:53.002
Let's just hope there's still
someone there to save.

02:15:21.488 --> 02:15:23.157
<i>Maximum velocity achieved.</i>

02:15:24.408 --> 02:15:26.744
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

02:15:27.036 --> 02:15:28.078
Ready?

02:15:28.537 --> 02:15:29.580
Ready.

02:15:29.913 --> 02:15:30.998
Ready.

02:15:31.206 --> 02:15:32.916
Main engine ignition in three...

02:15:33.417 --> 02:15:34.460
<i>...two...</i>

02:15:34.835 --> 02:15:36.795
...one. Mark.

02:15:50.267 --> 02:15:51.518
Come on, baby.

02:15:52.686 --> 02:15:54.855
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:56.231
Three...

02:15:56.649 --> 02:15:57.691
...two...

02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.443
<i>...one. Mark.</i>

02:16:04.782 --> 02:16:07.284
<i>Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.</i>

02:16:07.576 --> 02:16:09.912
<i>Three, two, one....</i>

02:16:10.454 --> 02:16:11.580
- <i>Mark.</i>
- Fire!

02:16:21.757 --> 02:16:24.927
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

02:16:25.803 --> 02:16:28.305
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

02:16:43.696 --> 02:16:46.865
<i>Lander 1, prepare to detach
on my mark.</i>

02:16:47.533 --> 02:16:49.535
Three... two...

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.830
<i>...one. Mark.</i>

02:16:52.996 --> 02:16:54.039
Detach!

02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:59.545
- <i>Good-bye, TARS.</i>
- Good-bye, Dr. Brand.

02:16:59.795 --> 02:17:02.798
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

02:17:11.306 --> 02:17:12.891
Okay, CASE....

02:17:13.934 --> 02:17:17.312
- <i>Nice reckless flying!</i>
- Learned from the master.

02:17:17.813 --> 02:17:20.399
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

02:17:20.649 --> 02:17:23.485
No! Cooper! What are you doing?

02:17:23.986 --> 02:17:27.406
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:30.159
You told me we had
resources for both of us.

02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:32.077
<i>We agreed, Amelia...</i>

02:17:32.619 --> 02:17:33.954
...90 percent.

02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:36.915
Don't.

02:17:39.126 --> 02:17:40.294
Detach.

02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:56.226
Okay, I am nosing down.

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.940
Approaching the event horizon.

02:18:04.193 --> 02:18:06.445
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

02:18:07.029 --> 02:18:08.697
...to go through it.

02:18:10.073 --> 02:18:13.118
<i>Heading towards blackness.</i>

02:18:13.452 --> 02:18:15.454
<i>I have a visual of the event.</i>

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.289
It's all black.

02:18:19.416 --> 02:18:21.084
TARS, do you read me?

02:18:21.418 --> 02:18:22.920
It's all blackness.

02:18:24.922 --> 02:18:26.924
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

02:18:31.762 --> 02:18:32.930
Okay.

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:35.390
Screens...

02:18:37.017 --> 02:18:38.519
...getting interference.

02:18:40.229 --> 02:18:42.815
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

02:18:43.398 --> 02:18:45.567
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

02:18:46.777 --> 02:18:49.279
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

02:18:55.953 --> 02:18:57.621
The computers are going down.

02:19:09.883 --> 02:19:12.719
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

02:19:46.003 --> 02:19:47.671
Murph? Murph, come on!

02:19:53.343 --> 02:19:55.345
<i>Eject. Eject.</i>

02:19:56.847 --> 02:19:57.931
<i>Eject.</i>

02:19:58.348 --> 02:19:59.516
<i>Eject.</i>

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:01.268
<i>Eject.</i>

02:20:01.977 --> 02:20:03.061
<i>Eject.</i>

02:21:55.257 --> 02:21:56.299
Murph.

02:22:06.268 --> 02:22:08.437
Murph! Murph! Murph!

02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.863
Murph!

02:22:25.078 --> 02:22:26.913
No, no, no!

02:22:27.164 --> 02:22:28.248
Murph!

02:22:28.582 --> 02:22:30.083
Murph!

02:22:30.292 --> 02:22:31.334
No! No!

02:23:31.019 --> 02:23:32.979
If you're leaving, just go.

02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:34.648
No, no.

02:23:36.233 --> 02:23:38.527
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

02:23:38.735 --> 02:23:40.028
Don't go!

02:23:41.988 --> 02:23:43.657
Morse. Morse.

02:23:44.407 --> 02:23:45.450
Morse.

02:23:45.909 --> 02:23:48.411
Dot. Dot.

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:49.663
S.

02:23:55.794 --> 02:23:56.837
T.

02:24:01.424 --> 02:24:02.467
A.

02:24:02.717 --> 02:24:03.760
Dash!

02:24:06.555 --> 02:24:07.889
Dash! Dash!

02:24:08.348 --> 02:24:09.391
Murph!

02:24:09.599 --> 02:24:11.601
Murph, we don't have time for this!

02:24:12.018 --> 02:24:13.103
Y.

02:24:18.441 --> 02:24:19.484
"Stay!"

02:24:30.579 --> 02:24:32.914
Come on, Murph. Come on!

02:24:33.582 --> 02:24:35.375
What's it say, Murph?

02:24:36.168 --> 02:24:37.252
What's it say?

02:24:47.804 --> 02:24:48.930
"Stay."

02:25:24.466 --> 02:25:25.926
Tell him, Murph.

02:25:26.134 --> 02:25:27.636
Make him stay.

02:25:30.972 --> 02:25:32.641
Make him stay, Murph.

02:25:41.650 --> 02:25:43.526
Make him stay, Murph.

02:25:44.986 --> 02:25:47.113
Don't let me leave, Murph!

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.577
Don't let me leave, Murph!

02:25:58.375 --> 02:26:00.710
No! No! No!

02:26:21.398 --> 02:26:22.899
It was you.

02:26:34.369 --> 02:26:36.413
You were my ghost.

02:26:46.131 --> 02:26:49.134
<i>Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.</i>

02:26:50.927 --> 02:26:53.430
- TARS?
- <i>Roger that.</i>

02:26:55.223 --> 02:26:57.851
- You survived.
- <i>Somewhere...</i>

02:26:58.393 --> 02:27:00.395
<i>...in their fifth dimension.</i>

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:02.647
<i>They saved us.</i>

02:27:03.064 --> 02:27:07.902
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

02:27:08.069 --> 02:27:11.156
<i>I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...</i>

02:27:11.323 --> 02:27:14.617
<i>...inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.</i>

02:27:14.826 --> 02:27:16.578
Yeah, that ain't working.

02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:18.204
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

02:27:18.455 --> 02:27:22.125
<i>You've seen that time is represented
here as a physical dimension.</i>

02:27:22.334 --> 02:27:25.337
<i>You have worked out that you can
exert a force across space-time.</i>

02:27:26.087 --> 02:27:29.382
Gravity to send a message.

02:27:29.758 --> 02:27:31.092
<i>Affirmative.</i>

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:34.804
Gravity...

02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:39.267
...can cross the dimensions, including time.

02:27:39.601 --> 02:27:40.894
<i>Apparently.</i>

02:27:44.773 --> 02:27:46.775
Do you have the quantum data?

02:27:47.192 --> 02:27:48.818
<i>Roger. I have it.</i>

02:27:49.778 --> 02:27:53.615
<i>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out.</i>

02:27:53.948 --> 02:27:56.117
I can do this.

02:27:56.451 --> 02:27:58.953
<i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.455
Not just any child.

02:28:00.872 --> 02:28:02.207
What else?

02:28:02.582 --> 02:28:05.585
Oh, come on, Dad.

02:28:07.087 --> 02:28:08.922
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

02:28:09.089 --> 02:28:13.426
<i>Even if you communicate it here,
she won't understand its significance for years.</i>

02:28:13.968 --> 02:28:15.428
I get that, TARS.

02:28:15.637 --> 02:28:20.308
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.684
<i>Cooper...</i>

02:28:22.268 --> 02:28:24.938
<i>...they didn't bring us here
to change the past.</i>

02:28:28.316 --> 02:28:29.651
Say that again.

02:28:29.984 --> 02:28:33.655
<i>They didn't bring us here
to change the past.</i>

02:28:37.826 --> 02:28:39.911
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

02:28:44.666 --> 02:28:46.334
We brought ourselves.

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:59.431
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

02:29:00.181 --> 02:29:02.642
<i>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</i>

02:29:26.958 --> 02:29:28.877
"It's not a ghost."

02:29:30.628 --> 02:29:32.130
"It's gravity."

02:29:32.464 --> 02:29:34.132
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:36.593
I brought myself here!

02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:40.972
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:42.891
We're the bridge!

02:29:50.899 --> 02:29:52.692
I thought they chose me.

02:29:56.029 --> 02:29:59.699
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- <i>For what?</i>

02:30:02.202 --> 02:30:03.870
To save the world.

02:30:08.166 --> 02:30:12.545
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

02:30:12.879 --> 02:30:14.214
It's infinitely complex.

02:30:14.422 --> 02:30:18.927
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

02:30:19.219 --> 02:30:24.057
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

02:30:25.558 --> 02:30:28.353
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

02:30:28.561 --> 02:30:30.146
...just like I found this moment.

02:30:30.355 --> 02:30:32.649
- <i>How, Cooper?</i>
- Love, TARS, love.

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:37.278
It's just like Brand said.
My connection with Murph it is quantifiable.
It's the key!

02:30:37.529 --> 02:30:39.364
<i>What are we here to do?</i>

02:30:40.281 --> 02:30:42.158
Find how to tell her.

02:30:44.953 --> 02:30:46.287
The watch.

02:30:49.415 --> 02:30:50.583
The watch.

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:53.086
That's it.

02:30:55.588 --> 02:30:58.591
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:05.390
TARS, translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me.

02:31:05.598 --> 02:31:06.933
<i>Translating data.</i>

02:31:07.392 --> 02:31:09.894
<i>Cooper, what if she never
came back for it?</i>

02:31:11.563 --> 02:31:14.232
She will. She will.

02:31:15.441 --> 02:31:16.943
Murph, I can see his car!

02:31:18.278 --> 02:31:19.320
He's coming!

02:31:21.281 --> 02:31:23.116
Okay. I'm coming down.

02:31:24.576 --> 02:31:26.077
<i>How do you know?</i>

02:31:29.289 --> 02:31:31.124
Because I gave it to her.

02:31:36.504 --> 02:31:39.007
<i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>

02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:43.636
Dot-dot...

02:31:44.971 --> 02:31:46.639
...dash-dot.

02:31:47.098 --> 02:31:48.766
<i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>

02:31:49.142 --> 02:31:51.811
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

02:31:52.145 --> 02:31:53.646
<i>Dash-dash-dash.</i>

02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:56.232
Dash, dash, dash.

02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:15.835
He came back!

02:32:16.753 --> 02:32:20.923
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

02:32:22.133 --> 02:32:23.968
Dad's gonna save us.

02:33:06.719 --> 02:33:07.970
Eureka!

02:33:11.724 --> 02:33:13.059
It's traditional.

02:33:17.689 --> 02:33:19.357
Eureka!

02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:25.571
Did it work?

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:27.573
<i>I think it might have.</i>

02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:30.201
How do you know?

02:33:30.451 --> 02:33:33.788
<i>Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.</i>

02:33:37.625 --> 02:33:39.627
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

02:33:40.795 --> 02:33:42.630
They're not "beings."

02:33:43.297 --> 02:33:44.632
They're us.

02:33:46.676 --> 02:33:50.012
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

02:33:50.346 --> 02:33:51.848
For all of us.

02:33:52.014 --> 02:33:54.183
<i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>

02:33:54.475 --> 02:33:56.769
No. No, not yet.

02:33:56.936 --> 02:33:58.646
But one day.

02:33:59.105 --> 02:34:02.650
Not you and me. But people.

02:34:03.151 --> 02:34:07.238
A civilization that's evolved
past the four dimensions we know.

02:34:13.828 --> 02:34:15.329
<i>What happens now?</i>

02:35:17.934 --> 02:35:19.393
Mr. Cooper.

02:35:23.606 --> 02:35:25.316
Let's take it slow, sir.

02:35:25.733 --> 02:35:27.777
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

02:35:28.069 --> 02:35:33.074
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

02:35:40.081 --> 02:35:41.415
Take it slow, sir.

02:35:42.458 --> 02:35:44.627
You were extremely lucky.

02:35:44.961 --> 02:35:48.297
The Rangers found you with only
minutes left in your oxygen supply.

02:36:02.478 --> 02:36:03.813
Where am I?

02:36:05.314 --> 02:36:07.024
Cooper Station.

02:36:08.276 --> 02:36:09.986
Currently orbiting Saturn.

02:36:11.821 --> 02:36:14.031
Cooper Station.

02:36:16.492 --> 02:36:18.619
Nice of you to name it after me.

02:36:22.331 --> 02:36:23.374
What?

02:36:23.624 --> 02:36:26.794
The station isn't named after you.
It's named after your daughter.

02:36:27.295 --> 02:36:30.339
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

02:36:30.506 --> 02:36:32.174
Is she still alive?

02:36:34.135 --> 02:36:36.012
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:42.059
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station,
but when she heard you'd been found...

02:36:43.311 --> 02:36:45.980
...well, this is Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

02:36:46.647 --> 02:36:48.357
Yes, it is.

02:36:50.484 --> 02:36:52.987
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

02:36:55.656 --> 02:36:57.992
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

02:36:59.327 --> 02:37:03.372
I actually did a paper on you in high school.

02:37:03.539 --> 02:37:06.042
I know all about your life back on Earth.

02:37:07.501 --> 02:37:09.003
Oh, yeah.

02:37:09.253 --> 02:37:10.296
Right.

02:37:13.215 --> 02:37:17.887
If you follow me, we've got
a really good situation for you.

02:37:21.223 --> 02:37:25.269
So when I made my suggestion
to Ms. Cooper...

02:37:26.145 --> 02:37:28.648
...I was delighted to hear
she thought it was perfect.

02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:35.696
<i>It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>

02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:38.741
Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.

02:37:38.908 --> 02:37:43.788
<i>We always set the plate upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside-down.</i>

02:37:44.038 --> 02:37:48.876
<i>My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.</i>

02:37:49.085 --> 02:37:51.420
<i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>

02:37:51.837 --> 02:37:54.548
<i>We wore little things, little strips...</i>

02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.845
<i>...of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>

02:38:00.054 --> 02:38:03.432
<i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.</i>

02:38:03.724 --> 02:38:07.895
<i>I don't care who describes it,
there is no way for it to be exaggerated.
It was that bad.</i>

02:38:08.062 --> 02:38:11.732
She did confirm just how much
you loved farming.

02:38:12.066 --> 02:38:13.818
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

02:38:13.985 --> 02:38:15.069
Come here.

02:38:15.695 --> 02:38:20.700
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it....

02:38:27.039 --> 02:38:29.041
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

02:38:29.250 --> 02:38:32.253
The machine we found out
near Saturn when we found you.

02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:35.214
Its power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

02:38:35.423 --> 02:38:37.425
Yes. Please.

02:38:38.634 --> 02:38:39.969
Settings.

02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:42.138
General settings.

02:38:42.471 --> 02:38:44.432
Security settings.

02:38:47.101 --> 02:38:49.437
Honesty, new setting:

02:38:50.563 --> 02:38:52.064
95 percent.

02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:54.900
Confirmed. Additional customization?

02:38:55.776 --> 02:38:56.902
Humor:

02:38:58.571 --> 02:38:59.905
75 percent.

02:39:00.281 --> 02:39:01.615
Confirmed.

02:39:02.283 --> 02:39:05.369
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine....

02:39:05.619 --> 02:39:07.621
Let's make that 60 percent.

02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:11.959
Sixty percent confirmed.

02:39:12.626 --> 02:39:15.755
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

02:39:20.509 --> 02:39:22.636
Is this really what it was like?

02:39:24.930 --> 02:39:27.266
It was never this clean, Slick.

02:39:31.771 --> 02:39:35.441
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

02:39:37.443 --> 02:39:39.820
I want to know where we are.

02:39:41.489 --> 02:39:42.990
<i>Where we're going.</i>

02:39:47.536 --> 02:39:50.539
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

02:39:50.831 --> 02:39:51.874
Family?

02:39:52.041 --> 02:39:55.920
They all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

02:40:28.994 --> 02:40:31.497
You told them I like farming.

02:40:36.836 --> 02:40:38.504
It was me, Murph.

02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:42.758
I was your ghost.

02:40:44.176 --> 02:40:45.678
I know.

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:52.059
People didn't believe me.
They thought I was doing it all myself.

02:40:52.393 --> 02:40:53.435
But...

02:40:56.272 --> 02:40:58.232
...I knew who it was.

02:41:03.237 --> 02:41:05.197
Nobody believed me.

02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:08.284
But I knew you'd come back.

02:41:10.703 --> 02:41:11.912
How?

02:41:14.039 --> 02:41:17.042
Because my dad promised me.

02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:25.092
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

02:41:26.385 --> 02:41:27.720
I'm here.

02:41:29.305 --> 02:41:30.514
No.

02:41:32.766 --> 02:41:36.729
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

02:41:39.648 --> 02:41:42.318
I have my kids here for me now.

02:41:45.279 --> 02:41:46.614
You go.

02:41:49.950 --> 02:41:51.160
Where?

02:41:54.955 --> 02:41:56.290
Brand.

02:42:06.091 --> 02:42:07.760
<i>She's out there...</i>

02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:15.976
<i>...setting up camp.</i>

02:42:42.378 --> 02:42:44.296
<i>Alone...</i>

02:42:45.005 --> 02:42:47.174
<i>...in a strange galaxy.</i>

02:42:58.519 --> 02:43:02.731
<i>Maybe right now she's settling in
for the long nap...</i>

02:43:21.625 --> 02:43:24.628
<i>...by the light of our new sun...</i>

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:42.438
<i>...in our new home.</i>
