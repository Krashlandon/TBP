WEBVTT

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.821
I never knew the old Vienna before the war...

00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:50.059
with its Strauss music,
its glamour and easy charm.

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:52.796
Constantinople suited me better.

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:57.307
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.344
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:03.278
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs...

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:06.475
but, well, they-you know,
they can't stay the course like a professional.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:09.781
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know...

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:13.585
each occupied by a power-the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:16.126
But the center of the city,
that's international...

00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:19.128
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.791
Wonderful! What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place...

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.165
and none of them
could speak the same language...

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.465
except a sort of smattering
of German.

00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:29.836
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:34.969
Vienna doesn't really look any worse than a lot
of other European cities. Bombed about a bit.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.174
Oh, I was gonna tell you-Wait.
I was gonna tell you about Holly Martins...

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:41.343
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:43.614
The name was Lime.
Harry Lime.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:47.180
Now, Martins was broke, and Lime had offered
him -I don't know-some sort of a job.

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:51.160
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.474
- Passport, please.
- Oh.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:08.012
- What's the purpose of your visit here?
- Friend of mine offered me a job here.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.673
- Where are you staying?
- With him. 15 Stiffgasse.

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:12.909
- His name?
- Lime. Harry Lime.

00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:15.485
- Okay.
- Thought he'd be here to meet me.

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:55.554
- Speak English?
- English?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.060
Uh -

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.154
Little. Little.

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:06.731
Uh, 10 minutes too late.

00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:09.102
- Already gone.
- Who?

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:12.802
Um, his friends and the - Uh, no.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.846
- Uh, coffin.
- Coffin?

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:18.040
Mr. Lime's.
An accident.

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.949
Knocked over by a car,
here in front of the house.

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:26.319
Have seen it myself.
Killed at once, immediately.

00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:30.918
Already in hell...
or in heaven.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:36.092
Sorry for the gravediggers.
Hard work. It is frost.

00:05:47.312 --> 00:05:50.975
Can you tell me, uh, who's the -

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:53.277
A fellow called Lime.

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.664
Like a lift to town?

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:25.538
I've got a car here.

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.683
Thanks.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.793
- My name's Calloway.
- Martins.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.865
- You a friend of Lime?
- Yeah.

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.366
- Been here long?
- No.

00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.539
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you?
You could do with a drink.

00:08:03.648 --> 00:08:06.515
- Could you buy me one? I haven't got any Austrian -
- Of course.

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.482
- Thanks.
- Schmolka.

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:12.086
I guess nobody knew Harry
like he did.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.626
- Like I did.
- How long ago?

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:17.661
Back in school.

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:21.163
I was never so lonesome
in my life till he showed up.

00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:23.756
- When did you see him last?
- September '39.

00:08:23.868 --> 00:08:25.893
- When the business started?
- Mm-hmm.

00:08:26.004 --> 00:08:28.131
- See much of him before that?
- Once in a while.

00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:31.970
- Best friend I ever had.
- That sounds like a cheap novelette.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.348
Well, I write cheap novelettes.

00:08:37.448 --> 00:08:40.508
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
What's your name again?

00:08:40.618 --> 00:08:42.984
- Holly Martins.
- No, sorry.

00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:46.181
You ever hear of
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.349
Can't say that I have.

00:08:48.459 --> 00:08:51.792
Death at Double-X Ranch?
Uh - (British Pronunciation) "Ranch."

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:54.831
- Nope.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:58.766
He must've known I was broke.
He even sent me an airplane ticket.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.634
- It's a shame.
- What?

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:04.708
Him dying like that.

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:07.369
Best thing that
ever happened to him.

00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:12.279
- What are you trying to say?
- He was about the worst racketeer
that ever made a dirty living in this city.

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:15.614
- Policeman, huh?
- Come on, have another drink.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.212
No, I never did like policemen.
I have to call them sheriffs.

00:09:19.323 --> 00:09:22.190
- Ever seen one?
- Pin it on a dead man.

00:09:22.293 --> 00:09:26.559
Some petty racket
with gasoline or something.

00:09:26.664 --> 00:09:30.657
Just like a cop.
You're a real cop, I suppose.

00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:33.862
- It wasn't petrol.
- So it wasn't petrol.

00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:36.804
So it was tires or saccharin or-

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:40.036
Why don't you catch
a few murderers for a change?

00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:43.409
Well, you could say that murder
was part of his racket.

00:09:45.349 --> 00:09:49.251
It's all right, Raine. He's only
a scribbler with too much drink in him.

00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:51.844
Take Mr. Holly Martins home.

00:09:51.956 --> 00:09:55.858
Holly Martins, sir?
The, uh -The writer?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.360
The author of
Death at Double-X Ranch?

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.988
- Listen, Callaghan-
- Calloway. I'm English, not Irish.

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:04.000
You're not going to close your
files at a dead man's expense.

00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:07.833
So you're going to find me the real criminal?
Sounds like one of your stories.

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:10.499
When I'm finished with you,
you'll leave Vienna, you'll look so silly.

00:10:10.608 --> 00:10:13.702
Here's some army money. It should see
you through tonight at Sacher's Hotel...

00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:15.745
if you don't drink too much
in the bar.

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:17.781
We'll keep a seat for you
on tomorrow's plane.

00:10:22.887 --> 00:10:26.550
Please be careful, sir.
Up we come.

00:10:26.657 --> 00:10:29.626
- Written anything lately?
- Take him to Sacher's.

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:32.093
Don't hit him again if he behaves.

00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:34.960
And you go carefully there.
It's a military hotel.

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:39.366
I'm so glad to have met you, sir.
I've read quite a few of your books.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.995
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- I like a good western.

00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:45.764
That's what I like about them. You can
pick them up and put them down anytime.

00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:47.344
- Oh, Mr. Hardtmuth.
- Yes, sir?

00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:50.380
Major Calloway said this gentleman's gotta have
a room for the night. He'll be off tomorrow.

00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:52.381
Passport, please.

00:10:52.483 --> 00:10:54.508
Can't very well
introduce you to everybody.

00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:58.651
Would you mind filling this in?

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.656
- Mr. Crabbin.
- What is it, Sergeant?

00:11:00.758 --> 00:11:02.521
- Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
- Who?

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:05.221
- The author. Thought you might be interested.
- Never heard of him.

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:07.729
He's very good, sir.
I've read quite a few of his books.

00:11:07.832 --> 00:11:11.734
Have you, Sergeant? Author? Martins?
Thank you, Sergeant.

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:14.896
Mr. Martins?
My name's Crabbin.

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:17.634
I represent the C.R.S. of G.H.Q.

00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:20.802
- You do?
- Yes. Cultural Reeducation Section.

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:23.244
Propaganda. Very important
in a place like this.

00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:25.907
We do a little show each week.
Last week we had Hamlet.

00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:29.077
The week before we had, um, something.

00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:31.985
- The striptease, sir.
- Yes, the Hindu dancers. Thank you, Sergeant.

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:35.252
This is the first opportunity we've had
of making an American author welcome.

00:11:35.359 --> 00:11:37.259
- Welcome?
- I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins.

00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:41.559
On Wednesday night, at our institute, we're
having a little lecture on the contemporary novel.

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:44.601
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

00:11:44.702 --> 00:11:47.603
Nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:50.435
- Very popular.
- Very popular. Are you staying long?

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:53.442
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

00:11:53.544 --> 00:11:56.342
Listen, Mr. Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest...

00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:59.109
- we'd be delighted to have you.

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.515
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:05.020
- But he's due to leave tomorrow, sir.
- Excuse me. Have you got a toothache?

00:12:05.122 --> 00:12:07.989
- Number 8, Mr. Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

00:12:08.092 --> 00:12:11.118
- I know a very good dentist.
- I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:14.198
Goodness. We must report that.
Were they trying to rob you?

00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:17.199
Oh, just a soldier. I was trying
to punch his major in the eye.

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:19.769
- No. A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.270
I've heard of him, of course,
but I didn't exactly know him.

00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:25.206
- I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
- Goodness, that's awkward.

00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:28.369
- That what you say to people after death?
"Goodness, that's awkward"?

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:31.004
Mr. Martins.
Excuse me. Telephone.

00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:32.878
Who is it?

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:37.148
- Baron Kurtz.
- Must be some mistake. Yes?

00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:39.746
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

00:12:39.857 --> 00:12:42.985
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.
Come around.

00:12:43.094 --> 00:12:45.562
Austrians aren't allowed
in your hotel.

00:12:45.663 --> 00:12:48.291
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Cafe?
- Where?

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:51.300
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:55.566
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:58.267
Be there in a moment.
Wait a minute.

00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.004
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:03.012
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:06.174
- Ever read a book of mine
called The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
- No, not that one.

00:13:06.284 --> 00:13:09.651
It's a story about a man who hunted down
a sheriff who was victimizing his best friend.

00:13:09.754 --> 00:13:11.654
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:14.919
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:17.017
Sounds anti-British, sir.

00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:33.207
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:36.747
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

00:13:38.883 --> 00:13:41.579
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:46.713
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

00:13:46.824 --> 00:13:48.416
- Tension?
- Suspense.

00:13:48.526 --> 00:13:52.929
- You really liked it?
- At the end of every chapter you are left guessing
what he'll be up to next.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.260
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

00:13:55.366 --> 00:13:58.597
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:03.504
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:08.943
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:13.949
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.954
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tires on the black market.

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:21.854
I wonder what my father
would have said.

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:27.420
- I'm afraid the police meant more than that.
- They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:30.295
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:32.801
Even so, I'm not going to leave it at this.

00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:34.803
Will you help me?

00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:41.541
I wish I could.
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:44.671
I have to be
careful with the police.

00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:47.774
I'm afraid I can't help you.

00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:51.218
Except with advice, of course.

00:14:51.322 --> 00:14:53.222
Advice.

00:14:54.558 --> 00:14:57.026
We came out of his place
like this...

00:14:57.128 --> 00:14:59.722
and were walking this way.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.958
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:07.697
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

00:15:07.805 --> 00:15:10.774
It was just about here.

00:15:12.276 --> 00:15:15.871
- Here?
- Yes.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.574
His friend and I picked him up...

00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:22.846
- carried him across over here.

00:15:22.953 --> 00:15:26.252
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:30.725
We laid him down just about here.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.930
And this is where he died.

00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:37.159
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:39.668
What did he say?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.500
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:46.372
- I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

00:15:46.477 --> 00:15:49.446
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived...

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:53.176
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:56.185
But he said he died instantaneously.

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:01.614
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:06.492
Well, there was only you and this, uh -
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:08.895
A Romanian. Mr. Ropescu.

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:12.127
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

00:16:17.508 --> 00:16:19.703
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.871
- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:26.779
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

00:16:26.884 --> 00:16:29.148
Who used to visit Mr. Lime?

00:16:29.253 --> 00:16:31.312
Visit? Eh -

00:16:42.366 --> 00:16:45.597
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:55.311
Excuse me.

00:16:58.015 --> 00:17:00.279
Who was at the funeral besides you?

00:17:00.384 --> 00:17:03.012
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.452
Wasn't there a girl there?

00:17:05.556 --> 00:17:09.720
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

00:17:09.827 --> 00:17:12.796
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:16.958
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:19.763
What's the good
of another postmortem?

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.601
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

00:17:23.707 --> 00:17:26.938
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

00:17:27.044 --> 00:17:29.672
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.271
One has to work the best way
one can, you know.

00:17:32.383 --> 00:17:34.783
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:36.944
I don't think I ever heard it.

00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:39.955
You did mention the theater.

00:17:40.057 --> 00:17:42.184
Josefstadt.

00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:45.729
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

00:17:45.829 --> 00:17:48.627
You'd do better
to think of yourself.

00:17:48.732 --> 00:17:51.496
I'll be all right.

00:17:51.602 --> 00:17:55.197
Of course.
I'm so glad I've met you.

00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:59.606
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.310
- Number 8, please.
- Major Calloway's compliments, sir.

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:08.647
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- Tell the major I won't need it.

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:11.619
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for the Josefstadt Theater.

00:18:11.722 --> 00:18:13.622
- Ah, Mr. Martins!
- Good evening, Mr. Crabbin.

00:18:13.724 --> 00:18:17.353
He said I was to drive you to the airfield
or take you to the bus, whichever you prefer.

00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:20.988
Didn't you hear Mr. Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the H.Q.B.M.T.?

00:19:14.418 --> 00:19:17.512
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

00:19:19.356 --> 00:19:21.756
- Afterwards.

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:44.746
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

00:19:44.848 --> 00:19:47.146
Oh, come in.

00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:49.151
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

00:19:49.253 --> 00:19:51.778
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Excuse me.

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:53.789
- Danke. Gute Nacht, Anna.
- Gute Nacht.

00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:55.916
You were -You were awfully good.

00:19:56.026 --> 00:20:00.588
- Do you understand German?
- No, I - Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:04.600
- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me.
My name is Holly Martins.

00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.693
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

00:20:06.804 --> 00:20:08.704
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:10.706
Someone threw me this packet last week.

00:20:10.808 --> 00:20:14.175
Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

00:20:14.278 --> 00:20:17.270
That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

00:20:17.381 --> 00:20:20.680
- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:25.050
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

00:20:27.157 --> 00:20:30.388
- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you - No, thank you.

00:20:30.494 --> 00:20:32.758
I wanted to talk to you about him.

00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:36.299
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.426
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:42.630
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:47.337
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

00:20:47.444 --> 00:20:51.972
I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:56.178
I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:58.413
Some more tea?

00:20:58.522 --> 00:21:02.515
No. No tea.
Would you like a cigarette?

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.151
Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:09.596
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.725
- Do you know him?
- No.

00:21:11.835 --> 00:21:14.998
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:17.767
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:21.038
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:23.375
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.881
Hmm.
He said he remembered me too.

00:21:26.984 --> 00:21:29.976
Seems to show
he wasn't in much pain.

00:21:30.087 --> 00:21:32.317
Dr. Winkel told me that.

00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:35.050
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:39.823
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.262
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:45.699
Well, were you at the inquest?

00:21:45.803 --> 00:21:48.704
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:51.707
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:54.710
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

00:21:54.812 --> 00:21:59.112
Well, uh, I don't get it.

00:21:59.216 --> 00:22:03.710
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh, Popescu...

00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:06.051
his own driver knocking him over...

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:08.647
his own doctor just passing by.

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:11.193
No strangers there at all.

00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:13.855
I know. I've wondered
about it a hundred times...

00:22:13.964 --> 00:22:16.432
if it really was an accident.

00:22:21.171 --> 00:22:23.503
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

00:22:23.607 --> 00:22:25.575
- But if it wasn't an -
- Fraulein Schmidt.

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:32.080
I must hurry. They don't like
us to use the lights.

00:22:32.182 --> 00:22:35.515
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

00:22:38.121 --> 00:22:40.089
Look, do you know that porter?

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.425
Yes.

00:22:50.534 --> 00:22:53.094
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

00:22:53.203 --> 00:22:55.933
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:59.099
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

00:22:59.209 --> 00:23:02.474
Heard. I heard the brakes.

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:06.037
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side...

00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:10.051
uh, of the Josef-the Josef-

00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:12.621
Emperor Josef statue.

00:23:12.723 --> 00:23:15.624
Why didn't they
bring him in the house?

00:23:39.616 --> 00:23:42.346
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:46.821
- Uh, was he -was he -was he still alive?

00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:50.087
Ah, alive!
He couldn't have been alive...

00:23:50.193 --> 00:23:53.492
not with his head in the way it was.

00:23:53.597 --> 00:23:55.588
I was told that
he did not die at once.

00:23:58.268 --> 00:24:00.168
No, I mean that -

00:24:02.272 --> 00:24:04.399
- No, you -
- Fraulein Schmidt.

00:24:08.512 --> 00:24:11.777
- He was quite dead.
- He was - He was quite dead.

00:24:11.882 --> 00:24:14.282
He was quite dead.

00:24:14.384 --> 00:24:16.784
But this sounds crazy.

00:24:16.887 --> 00:24:20.687
If he was killed at once, how could he have
talked about me and this lady after he was dead?

00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:23.624
Why didn't you say all this
at the inquest?

00:24:23.727 --> 00:24:27.720
Uh, it's better not to be
mixed up in things like this.

00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:30.197
Things like what?

00:24:31.535 --> 00:24:34.561
I was not the only one
who did not give evidence.

00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:36.070
Who else?

00:24:36.173 --> 00:24:39.438
Three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue.

00:24:39.543 --> 00:24:41.033
- Kurtz?
- Yes.

00:24:41.144 --> 00:24:42.975
- The Romanian?
- Yes.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.277
- And?
- There was a third man. He didn't give evidence.

00:24:46.383 --> 00:24:48.283
- You don't mean the doctor?
- No, no, no.

00:24:48.385 --> 00:24:51.616
He came later, after they
carried him to the Josef statue.

00:24:51.722 --> 00:24:54.213
What did this man look like?

00:24:54.324 --> 00:24:56.417
I didn't see his face.

00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:02.465
He didn't look up.
He was, uh...

00:25:02.566 --> 00:25:05.126
quite, uh, gewöhnlich - ordinary.

00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:09.501
He-He might have been...

00:25:09.606 --> 00:25:11.506
just anybody.

00:25:13.343 --> 00:25:15.243
Just anybody.

00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:20.912
Hello? Hello.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.120
Hallo.

00:25:30.227 --> 00:25:31.751
Hello?

00:25:32.863 --> 00:25:34.854
- Who was that?

00:25:34.965 --> 00:25:37.263
I don't know. They didn't answer.

00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:39.835
But I was told
there were only two men there.

00:25:39.936 --> 00:25:42.268
You've got to tell
your story to the police.

00:25:42.372 --> 00:25:45.808
The police? Why police?

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:49.072
It's nonsense! It is all nonsense!
It was an accident.

00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:51.079
You don't know it was an accident.

00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:54.378
- You only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him.

00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:56.543
I should have listened to my wife.

00:25:56.653 --> 00:25:59.451
She said you were
up to no good. Gossip.

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:01.456
Suppose I take
your evidence to the police?

00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:06.021
Now, hold on.

00:26:11.401 --> 00:26:14.632
I have no evidence.
I-I saw nothing, I said nothing.

00:26:14.738 --> 00:26:16.899
- It's not my business.
- We'll make it your business.

00:26:19.776 --> 00:26:21.710
Hold on.

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:30.250
I have always liked you, but you
must not bring this gentleman again.

00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:33.083
You must go at once, please. Please!

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.591
Please!

00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:45.833
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.

00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:50.032
Well, if I do find out something,
can I look you up again?

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.438
Why don't you leave
this town? Go home.

00:27:02.385 --> 00:27:04.945
- What is it?

00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:15.958
- What's she talking about?
- The police. They are searching my room.

00:27:46.563 --> 00:27:49.498
- What the devil?
- Getting around, Martins?

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:54.400
- Oh, pinning things on girls now.
- Miss Schmidt, I should like
to see your papers, please.

00:27:54.504 --> 00:27:56.472
Don't you give him anything.

00:27:58.408 --> 00:28:00.308
Thank you.

00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:06.409
- You were born in Graz of Austrian parents?
- Yes.

00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:10.353
Paine.

00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:19.561
Hmm.

00:28:25.035 --> 00:28:27.162
It's very good, sir, isn't it, eh?

00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:30.432
How much did you pay for this?

00:28:32.075 --> 00:28:34.703
I'm afraid I shall have to keep
this for a while, Miss Schmidt.

00:28:34.811 --> 00:28:38.440
- How do you expect her
to live in this city without her papers?
- Write her out a receipt.

00:28:38.548 --> 00:28:41.312
- And give her a receipt for those letters too.
- This way, miss.

00:28:41.418 --> 00:28:44.615
I suppose it wouldn't interest you
to know that Harry Lime was murdered.

00:28:44.721 --> 00:28:48.020
You're too busy. You haven't even
bothered to get the complete evidence.

00:28:55.098 --> 00:28:58.556
- Must you take those?
- They'll be returned, miss.

00:28:58.668 --> 00:29:01.398
They are private letters.

00:29:01.504 --> 00:29:03.563
That's all right, miss.
Don't worry.

00:29:03.673 --> 00:29:06.574
We're used to it.
Like doctors.

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:10.373
There was a third man there. I suppose
that doesn't sound peculiar to you.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.281
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime
was killed by his friends or by an accident.

00:29:15.385 --> 00:29:17.376
The only important thing
is that he's dead.

00:29:19.189 --> 00:29:22.386
- I'm sorry.
- Tactful, too, aren't we, Callaghan?

00:29:22.492 --> 00:29:24.653
- Calloway.
- Must you take those letters?

00:29:24.761 --> 00:29:27.229
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- They're Harry's.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.289
- That's the reason.
- You won't learn anything from them.

00:29:31.401 --> 00:29:35.167
They're only... love letters.
There are not many of them.

00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:38.673
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt,
as soon as they've been examined.

00:29:38.775 --> 00:29:41.835
There's nothing in them.
Harry never did anything.

00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:45.507
Only a small thing once,
out of kindness.

00:29:45.615 --> 00:29:49.779
- And what was that?
- You've got it in your hand.

00:29:49.886 --> 00:29:52.286
Major Calloway.

00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:55.290
- Finished?
- Yes. Okay.

00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:58.384
You will have to come
with us, Miss Schmidt.

00:29:58.495 --> 00:30:02.761
- You're not locking her up.
- Go home, Martins, like a sensible chap.
You don't know what you're mixing in.

00:30:02.866 --> 00:30:06.666
- Get the next plane.
- As soon as I get to the bottom of this,
I'll get the next plane.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.170
Death's at the bottom of everything.
Leave death to the professionals.

00:30:09.272 --> 00:30:13.299
Mind if I use that line in my next western?
You can't chuck me out. My papers are in order.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.312
- Here we are, miss. Your receipt for the letters.
- I don't want it.

00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:19.609
Well, I've got it
when you want it, miss.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.888
Anything really wrong
with your papers?

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:32.119
They're forged.

00:30:32.228 --> 00:30:34.594
Oh.

00:30:34.698 --> 00:30:36.689
Why?

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.395
The Russians would claim me.
I come from Czechoslovakia.

00:31:03.693 --> 00:31:07.789
- What's she saying?
- Only complaining about the way
they behave in her house.

00:31:11.868 --> 00:31:14.166
Give her some cigarettes.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.641
- Uh, cigarettes, hmm?
- Danke.

00:31:24.214 --> 00:31:27.115
Miss Schmidt, ready?

00:31:27.217 --> 00:31:29.583
Now, look...

00:31:29.686 --> 00:31:34.248
I'll, uh, straighten out
all this nonsense about Harry.

00:31:35.692 --> 00:31:37.592
You'll be all right.

00:31:39.929 --> 00:31:42.523
Sometimes he said
I laughed too much.

00:31:45.702 --> 00:31:48.603
Oh, what's the name of that doctor?
Harry's doctor?

00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:52.641
- Dr. Winkel.
- What do you want to see a doctor for? Hmm?

00:31:52.742 --> 00:31:55.506
- A bruised lip.
- Good.

00:32:09.692 --> 00:32:12.024
Laboratory, we're coming right down.

00:32:19.602 --> 00:32:21.695
You wait here, Miss Schmidt.

00:32:55.104 --> 00:32:57.937
- Is Dr. Winkel in?

00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:01.010
- Dr. Winkel. I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- Nein.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.410
Please, won't you say that
I'm a friend of Harry Lime?

00:33:08.685 --> 00:33:10.710
- Bitte.
- Thank you.

00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:15.351
- Bitte sehr.

00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:27.202
Guten Abend.

00:33:27.303 --> 00:33:30.431
- Dr. Winkel?
- "Vinkel."

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.667
Uh, Dr. "Vinkel."

00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:36.302
Quite a collection of, uh -
collection.

00:33:36.412 --> 00:33:38.676
- Yes.

00:33:49.692 --> 00:33:51.990
Is that your dog?

00:33:52.095 --> 00:33:54.086
Yes. Would you mind, Mr., uh -

00:33:54.197 --> 00:33:56.392
- Martins.
- Martins, coming to the point, please?

00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:58.592
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:02.262
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical adviser.

00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:05.364
- I want to find out all I can.
- Find out?

00:34:05.475 --> 00:34:08.444
- Hear the details.
- I can tell you very little.

00:34:08.545 --> 00:34:12.606
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:16.481
- Who was with him?
- Two friends of his.

00:34:16.586 --> 00:34:19.180
You sure? Two?

00:34:19.289 --> 00:34:21.257
Quite sure.

00:34:22.292 --> 00:34:24.522
Could he have been at all conscious?

00:34:24.627 --> 00:34:28.495
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time...

00:34:28.598 --> 00:34:30.998
while they carried him
across the road.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.069
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.264
Could he have been capable
of making plans...

00:34:37.373 --> 00:34:41.810
for me and others just-
just during those few moments?

00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:44.812
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

00:34:44.914 --> 00:34:48.145
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

00:34:48.251 --> 00:34:52.585
My opinion is, uh,
limited to the causes of death.

00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:57.359
Have you any reason
to be dissatisfied?

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.521
Was it possible that his death
might have been...

00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:03.531
not accidental?

00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:07.565
Could he have been-

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.766
Could he have been...
pushed, Dr. Winkel?

00:35:14.043 --> 00:35:16.511
"Vinkel."

00:35:16.613 --> 00:35:18.945
I cannot give an opinion.

00:35:19.048 --> 00:35:23.451
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

00:35:30.393 --> 00:35:33.294
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

00:35:33.396 --> 00:35:35.523
Certainly, Brodsky.
What is it?

00:35:35.632 --> 00:35:40.228
This forgery is very clever,
and we are interested in this case.

00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:42.304
- Have you arrested the girl?
- No, not yet.

00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:46.933
Please, keep this passport to yourself until
I will make some inquiries. Will you, Major?

00:35:47.043 --> 00:35:49.238
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:51.370
Right, sit down, Miss Schmidt.

00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:53.847
We'll send your letters
and things back to you.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.044
- And my passport?
- We'll need that for a while longer.

00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:04.559
What did he mean?

00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:07.061
You know as much as I do.

00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:09.791
Miss Schmidt...

00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:11.799
you were intimate
with Lime, weren't you?

00:36:13.002 --> 00:36:15.232
We loved each other.
Do you mean that?

00:36:15.338 --> 00:36:17.772
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

00:36:17.874 --> 00:36:20.206
- Joseph Harbin.
- No.

00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:23.244
- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

00:36:24.747 --> 00:36:28.649
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:30.878
I'm not lying.

00:36:30.987 --> 00:36:33.615
You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

00:36:33.723 --> 00:36:38.319
In one of his letters, he asked you to telephone
a good friend of his called Joseph.

00:36:38.428 --> 00:36:41.329
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:43.661
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:49.198
- It wasn't important.
- What was the message?

00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:51.933
Something about
meeting Harry at his home.

00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.442
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

00:36:55.545 --> 00:36:58.639
We've got to find him.
You can help us.

00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:03.883
What can I tell you, but you've
got everything upside down.

00:37:03.986 --> 00:37:06.284
Okay.

00:37:06.389 --> 00:37:09.222
That American friend
of yours is still waiting for you.

00:37:10.326 --> 00:37:12.794
He won't do you much good.

00:37:15.498 --> 00:37:18.399
I thank you, Miss Schmidt.
We'll send for you when we want you.

00:37:26.242 --> 00:37:29.643
Hello, Mr. Martins. I've been
trying to get you at your hotel.

00:37:29.746 --> 00:37:31.976
I've arranged that lecture
for tomorrow.

00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:35.107
- Well, what about?
- On the modern novel.
You remember what we arranged.

00:37:35.218 --> 00:37:37.652
- Oh.
- They want you to talk on the crisis of faith.

00:37:37.754 --> 00:37:40.814
- What's that?
- Oh, I thought you'd know. You're a writer.

00:37:40.923 --> 00:37:44.324
But of course you do.
Good night, old man. Oh, I've forgotten my hat.

00:37:44.427 --> 00:37:46.827
- I'll let you know the time later.
- Mmm.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.270
- Drink?
- Whiskey.

00:37:56.372 --> 00:37:58.272
Two whiskeys.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.948
- Zwei Whisky.
- How much?

00:38:06.048 --> 00:38:08.881
- Oh, they don't take army money here.

00:38:08.985 --> 00:38:10.885
How much did he say?

00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:15.289
- Harry?
- Yes.

00:38:16.392 --> 00:38:18.986
He moved his head,
but the rest is good, isn't it?

00:38:35.044 --> 00:38:37.569
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.080
You've found out my little secret.

00:38:40.183 --> 00:38:42.083
A man must live.

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:44.085
How goes the investigation?

00:38:44.187 --> 00:38:46.417
- Have you proved the policemen are wrong?
- Not yet.

00:38:46.522 --> 00:38:50.549
But you will.
Our friend Dr. Winkel said you had called.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.118
- Wasn't he helpful?
- Well, he was, uh, limited.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.131
- But Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

00:38:57.233 --> 00:38:59.463
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

00:38:59.569 --> 00:39:01.628
He's back now.

00:39:01.737 --> 00:39:04.934
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:07.134
I'll bring him to you.

00:39:07.243 --> 00:39:09.177
Haven't you done enough for tonight?

00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:13.578
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

00:39:19.288 --> 00:39:21.654
Who are you lookin' for now?

00:39:21.757 --> 00:39:24.123
Shh. Shh.
Don't. Don't. Please don't.

00:39:25.528 --> 00:39:27.462
Silly lookin' bunch.

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:31.724
- Mr. Popescu, Mr. Martins.
- How do you do?

00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:34.462
- How do you do?
- Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:36.504
- I'll leave you together.
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.

00:39:36.606 --> 00:39:39.302
- You remember me?
- Of course.

00:39:39.408 --> 00:39:42.343
- I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins.
- Oh, you did?

00:39:42.445 --> 00:39:44.777
Not the sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger...

00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:47.441
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.984
Humanity is a duty.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?

00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:51.713
- Keep the pack.

00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:54.289
I understand
you were with Harry-

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.688
Two double whiskeys.

00:40:00.162 --> 00:40:04.565
It was a terrible thing. I was just
crossing the road to go to Harry.

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:07.898
He and the baron
were on the sidewalk.

00:40:08.004 --> 00:40:11.701
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross
the road, it wouldn't have happened.

00:40:11.807 --> 00:40:15.868
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:21.143
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.514
And the truck-

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:27.885
It was terrible, Mr. Martins. Terrible.
I've never seen a man killed before.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.686
I think there was something
funny about the whole thing.

00:40:30.793 --> 00:40:33.227
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:36.560
Of course there was.
Some ice for Mr. Martins.

00:40:36.666 --> 00:40:39.430
- You think so too, hmm?
- It was so terribly stupid...

00:40:39.535 --> 00:40:42.971
for a man like Harry to be killed
in an ordinary street accident.

00:40:43.072 --> 00:40:45.233
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:48.071
Who was the third man?

00:40:48.177 --> 00:40:50.975
I oughtn't to drink it.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.980
It makes me acid.

00:40:53.082 --> 00:40:55.016
What man would you be
referring to, Mr. Martins?

00:40:55.117 --> 00:40:57.915
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.514
Oh, I don't know how you got that idea.
You'll find all about it in the police report.

00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:05.423
There was just the two of us.
Me and the baron.

00:41:05.528 --> 00:41:07.894
Who could have told you
a story like that?

00:41:07.997 --> 00:41:11.057
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.067
And saw the accident?

00:41:13.169 --> 00:41:17.037
No, he didn't see the accident,
but he saw three men carrying the body.

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:19.869
Why wasn't he at the police inquiry?

00:41:19.976 --> 00:41:21.944
He doesn't want to get involved.

00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:24.604
You'll never teach these
Austrians to be good citizens.

00:41:24.714 --> 00:41:27.478
It was his duty
to give the evidence.

00:41:27.583 --> 00:41:29.483
Even so, he remembers wrong.

00:41:29.585 --> 00:41:31.849
What else did he tell you?

00:41:31.954 --> 00:41:35.515
That Harry was dead before
you got him to that statue.

00:41:35.624 --> 00:41:38.354
He probably knows
a lot more than that.

00:41:38.461 --> 00:41:40.986
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:44.089
The police say he was
mixed up in some, uh, racket?

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.966
Oh, that's quite impossible.
He had a great sense of duty.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.630
Your friend Kurtz seems
to think it was possible.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.972
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.
The baron hasn't traveled, you know?

00:41:55.077 --> 00:41:57.773
He seems to have been around a bit.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.849
Do you know a man
called, uh, Harbin?

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.783
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

00:42:03.886 --> 00:42:06.081
Joseph Harbin? No.

00:42:08.924 --> 00:42:13.588
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

00:42:13.696 --> 00:42:17.496
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.035
He will meet us at the bridge. Good.

00:43:01.177 --> 00:43:04.874
Hello!
Is it so very important for you?

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.471
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:09.847
I'd like to tell you something.

00:43:09.952 --> 00:43:11.852
Tell me, how did the car-

00:43:11.954 --> 00:43:16.050
Shh, shh. Come tonight.
My wife goes out.

00:43:16.158 --> 00:43:19.525
- All right, I'll come back, but -
- Shh. Tonight.

00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.479
Does that mean come in?

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.514
Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

00:43:39.615 --> 00:43:41.549
The porter's going
to talk to us tonight.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.550
Need we go through it all again?

00:43:43.652 --> 00:43:46.314
I can manage by myself.
You busy?

00:43:46.422 --> 00:43:48.856
Just another part I've got to learn.

00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:51.085
Can I hear you?

00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:53.218
- In German?
- I can try.

00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:56.924
- Is it comedy or tragedy?
- Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

00:43:57.032 --> 00:43:59.432
- Do I, uh, read -
- Well, you read this.

00:43:59.535 --> 00:44:02.527
Oh. Well, uh -

00:44:05.774 --> 00:44:09.107
- What's that?
- Uh, Heurigen, I guess.

00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.441
H-E-Z-T -

00:44:11.547 --> 00:44:14.038
Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.209
It means she has to sit down.

00:44:19.855 --> 00:44:24.189
Well, uh, Frau Hausman-

00:44:25.394 --> 00:44:27.988
No, no.

00:44:28.097 --> 00:44:30.065
It's no good.

00:44:31.734 --> 00:44:33.634
Bad day?

00:44:33.736 --> 00:44:35.931
It's always bad around this time.

00:44:37.173 --> 00:44:39.641
He used to look in around 6:00.

00:44:41.477 --> 00:44:45.504
I've been frightened. I've been alone
without friends and money.

00:44:45.614 --> 00:44:48.879
But I've never known
anything like this.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:53.986
- Please talk. Tell me about him.
- Tell you what?

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.183
Oh, anything. Just talk.

00:44:57.293 --> 00:45:00.660
Where did you see him last?
When? What did you do?

00:45:00.763 --> 00:45:03.789
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:06.800
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

00:45:08.938 --> 00:45:10.838
Oh, that was nine years ago.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.908
- Tell me more.

00:45:13.008 --> 00:45:15.272
Well, it's very difficult.
You knew Harry.

00:45:16.378 --> 00:45:19.006
We didn't do anything very amusing.

00:45:19.114 --> 00:45:22.049
He just made everything
seem like such, uh, fun.

00:45:22.151 --> 00:45:26.019
- Was he clever when he was a boy?
- I suppose so. He could fix anything.

00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:28.954
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

00:45:29.058 --> 00:45:33.188
How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.991
How to avoid this and that.

00:45:36.098 --> 00:45:38.464
He fixed my papers for me.

00:45:38.567 --> 00:45:43.300
He heard the Russians were repatriating
people like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:46.499
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:48.133
Yeah.

00:45:48.244 --> 00:45:51.270
When he was 14, he taught me
the three-card trick.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.747
- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:58.648
The world grew up
around him, that's all.

00:46:00.322 --> 00:46:03.814
- And buried him.
- Anna.

00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:09.053
- You'll fall in love again.
- Don't you see I don't want to?

00:46:09.164 --> 00:46:11.064
I don't ever want to.

00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:13.691
Come on out and have a drink.

00:46:13.802 --> 00:46:16.270
Why did you say that?

00:46:16.372 --> 00:46:18.806
Seemed like a good idea.

00:46:18.907 --> 00:46:21.603
It was just what he used to say.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.669
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

00:46:25.781 --> 00:46:28.341
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.510
What's the hurry? Can't we talk
quietly for a couple of minutes?

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.851
- I thought you wanted -
- A moment ago, you said you
didn't want to see the porter.

00:46:34.957 --> 00:46:38.449
- We're both in it, Harry.
- Holly.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.790
I'm so sorry.

00:46:40.896 --> 00:46:44.696
It's all right.
You might get my name right.

00:46:47.736 --> 00:46:50.899
You know, you ought
to find yourself a girl.

00:46:52.074 --> 00:46:54.634
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

00:46:54.743 --> 00:46:57.234
- If you'll just be good enough to trans -
- Look.

00:46:59.682 --> 00:47:02.048
- That's Harry's place, isn't it?
- Yes.

00:47:02.151 --> 00:47:05.052
- Let's go away.
- What's the matter?

00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:07.315
Let's not get into any more trouble.

00:47:07.423 --> 00:47:09.391
Wait here.

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:16.855
What's the matter?
Uh, what is, uh, los, uh -

00:47:16.965 --> 00:47:20.230
- I-I don't understand.

00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:23.134
Um, porter, uh, dead.

00:47:23.238 --> 00:47:26.469
- Kaputt.
- The porter is -

00:47:26.575 --> 00:47:28.475
Kaputt.

00:47:28.577 --> 00:47:30.477
- Porter?
- He's murdered.

00:47:30.579 --> 00:47:32.479
Papa!

00:47:55.504 --> 00:47:57.870
I, uh, don't understand.

00:48:07.983 --> 00:48:11.350
- What is it?
- The porter's been murdered.

00:48:17.326 --> 00:48:20.818
- They think you did it.

00:48:40.015 --> 00:48:42.609
Papa!

00:48:46.088 --> 00:48:48.852
- Papa!

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.443
Their money's no good.

00:49:27.996 --> 00:49:31.523
Sneak out the other way and go back
to your theater. I'd better not see you again.

00:49:31.633 --> 00:49:34.158
- What are you going to do?
- I wish I knew.

00:49:34.269 --> 00:49:36.533
Be sensible.
Tell Major Calloway.

00:49:57.826 --> 00:50:00.556
- Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
- Oh, Mr. Martins.

00:50:00.662 --> 00:50:03.426
- It's very urgent. Just get him on the telephone.
- Do you know his number?

00:50:03.532 --> 00:50:06.433
- No, I don't know his number.
- I'll look it up for you.

00:50:06.535 --> 00:50:10.972
- Is there a car here I can use?
- Of course. There's one waiting for you.

00:50:11.073 --> 00:50:14.270
- Never mind about the number.

00:50:20.582 --> 00:50:23.073
Take me to the headquarters -

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.189
Hold on! Hold on! I haven't even
told you where to take me yet!

00:50:34.363 --> 00:50:38.459
- Driver! Driver!

00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:42.503
- Slow down!

00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:45.471
Have you got orders to kill me?

00:51:17.806 --> 00:51:21.799
Ah, Mr. Martins! What a relief to see you.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.674
I was beginning to think
something had happened to you.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.375
Come along, Mr. Martins. Everything's ready
for you. I was frantic in case you hadn't got...

00:51:28.483 --> 00:51:30.815
my message at the hotel.

00:51:30.919 --> 00:51:33.615
The porters out here are so unreliable,
if you know what I mean.

00:51:33.722 --> 00:51:35.656
We're all set
for a wonderful meeting.

00:51:35.757 --> 00:51:38.021
You'll find the audience
most appreciative.

00:51:38.126 --> 00:51:40.492
Oh, let me take your coat.
I've got it.

00:51:40.596 --> 00:51:43.759
There'll be refreshments afterwards.
Come along, Mr. M. Follow me.

00:51:43.865 --> 00:51:46.493
Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
All's well that ends well.

00:51:46.602 --> 00:51:48.570
Would you look after those for me?
Thank you.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.002
Would you like to sit there, Mr. Martins?
That's right.

00:51:51.106 --> 00:51:55.600
Ladies and gentlemen, I have much pleasure in
introducing Mr. Holly Martins from the other side.

00:52:00.682 --> 00:52:03.549
Well -

00:52:03.652 --> 00:52:06.951
Bring the car and anyone
else who would like to come.

00:52:07.055 --> 00:52:10.047
Don't be long. Hmm.

00:52:13.695 --> 00:52:17.187
Yeah, well, I - I suppose
that is what I meant to say.

00:52:17.299 --> 00:52:19.199
Of course, of course, of course.

00:52:19.301 --> 00:52:22.065
Do you believe, Mr. Martins,
in the stream of consciousness?

00:52:24.139 --> 00:52:28.371
Stream of consciousness?
Well, uh -

00:52:28.477 --> 00:52:32.072
- Well, uh -
- What author has chiefly influenced you?

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.013
- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

00:52:35.117 --> 00:52:38.575
- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr. Martins's little joke, of course.

00:52:38.687 --> 00:52:41.952
We all know perfectly well Zane Grey
wrote what we call westerns.

00:52:42.057 --> 00:52:44.025
Cowboys and bandits.

00:52:44.126 --> 00:52:48.153
Mr. James Joyce-
Now, where would you put him?

00:52:49.998 --> 00:52:52.489
Oh, uh, would you mind
repeating that question?

00:52:52.601 --> 00:52:55.764
I said, where would you put
Mr. James Joyce?

00:52:55.871 --> 00:53:01.332
- In what category?
- Can I ask, is Mr. Martins engaged on a new book?

00:53:02.444 --> 00:53:06.278
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:09.441
- A novel, Mr. Martins?
- It's a murder story.

00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:12.816
I've just started it.
It's based on fact.

00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:16.914
Why, it's Mr. Popescu!
Oh, very great pleasure to see you here.

00:53:17.025 --> 00:53:21.621
As you know, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Popescu is a very great supporter
of one of our medical charities.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.665
Are you a slow writer, Mr. Martins?

00:53:24.766 --> 00:53:27.291
Not when I get interested.

00:53:27.402 --> 00:53:30.371
I'd say you were doing something
pretty dangerous this time.

00:53:30.472 --> 00:53:33.669
- Yeah?
- Mixing fact and fiction.

00:53:33.775 --> 00:53:37.370
- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr. Martins.

00:53:37.479 --> 00:53:39.879
I'd say stick to fiction.
Straight fiction.

00:53:39.981 --> 00:53:42.848
I'm too far along
with the book, Mr. Popescu.

00:53:42.951 --> 00:53:46.011
- Haven't you ever scrapped a book, Mr. Martins?
- Never.

00:53:46.121 --> 00:53:47.850
Pity.

00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:52.620
Ladies and gentlemen, if there are
no more questions for Mr. Martins...

00:53:52.728 --> 00:53:55.060
I think I can call the meeting
officially closed.

00:54:33.535 --> 00:54:36.663
Who's there?
Who is it?

00:54:36.772 --> 00:54:38.364
Who is it?

00:54:40.842 --> 00:54:43.675
It's all right.
It's all right.

00:55:47.175 --> 00:55:49.507
I told you to go away, Martins.

00:55:49.611 --> 00:55:53.138
This isn't Santa Fe, I'm not a sheriff
and you aren't a cowboy.

00:55:53.248 --> 00:55:56.183
You've been blundering around with
the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna -

00:55:56.284 --> 00:55:58.844
your precious Harry's friends -
and now you're wanted for murder.

00:55:58.954 --> 00:56:01.422
- Put down drunk and disorderly too.
- I have.

00:56:01.523 --> 00:56:03.957
- What's the matter with your hand?
- Parrot bit me.

00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:06.892
Oh, stop behaving
like a fool, Martins.

00:56:06.995 --> 00:56:10.226
I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur at it.
You're a professional.

00:56:10.332 --> 00:56:12.630
You've been shaking
your cap and bells all over town.

00:56:12.734 --> 00:56:16.226
Paine, get me the Harry Lime file,
and get Mr. Martins a large whiskey.

00:56:16.338 --> 00:56:18.772
I don't need your drinks, Calloway.

00:56:18.874 --> 00:56:21.468
You will. I don't want
another murder in this case...

00:56:21.576 --> 00:56:24.374
and you were born to be murdered,
so you're going to hear the facts.

00:56:24.479 --> 00:56:26.344
You haven't told me
a single one yet.

00:56:28.049 --> 00:56:30.017
Have you ever heard of penicillin?

00:56:30.118 --> 00:56:34.214
- Well?
- In Vienna, there hasn't been
enough penicillin to go round.

00:56:34.322 --> 00:56:36.950
So a nice trade started here:

00:56:37.058 --> 00:56:40.118
Stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals...

00:56:40.228 --> 00:56:43.959
diluting it to make it go further
and selling it to patients.

00:56:44.065 --> 00:56:46.363
- Do you see what that means?
- Are you too busy...

00:56:46.468 --> 00:56:49.198
chasing a few tubes of penicillin
to investigate a murder?

00:56:49.304 --> 00:56:51.602
These were murders.

00:56:51.706 --> 00:56:53.833
Men with gangrened legs...

00:56:53.942 --> 00:56:56.570
women in childbirth,
and there were children too.

00:56:56.678 --> 00:57:00.205
They used some of this diluted
penicillin against meningitis.

00:57:00.315 --> 00:57:02.215
The lucky children died.

00:57:02.317 --> 00:57:05.718
The unlucky ones went off their heads.
You can see them now in the mental ward.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.653
That was the racket
Harry Lime organized.

00:57:08.757 --> 00:57:11.920
Calloway, you haven't shown me
one shred of evidence.

00:57:12.027 --> 00:57:17.192
We're just coming to that.
Paine, magic lantern show.

00:57:17.299 --> 00:57:19.199
Very good, sir.

00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:21.394
Raine's one of your devoted readers.

00:57:21.503 --> 00:57:23.937
He's promised to lend me one
of your books. Which one is it, Paine?

00:57:24.039 --> 00:57:26.098
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe, sir.

00:57:26.207 --> 00:57:30.075
- That's right. The Lone Rider of Santa Fe.
- I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

00:57:30.178 --> 00:57:33.306
- Come on. Show me what you've got to show.
- All right, Paine?

00:57:33.415 --> 00:57:35.007
Yes, sir.

00:57:37.385 --> 00:57:39.410
Paine, Paine, Paine.

00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:43.582
I got them muddled. It's the new lot
that's just come in for Mr. Crabbin.

00:57:45.527 --> 00:57:48.655
See this man here?
A fellow called Harbin...

00:57:48.763 --> 00:57:51.596
a medical orderly
at the general hospital.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.466
He worked for Lime and helped to steal
the stuff from the laboratories.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.064
We forced him to give information to us
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

00:58:00.175 --> 00:58:02.609
But we didn't arrest them,
as our evidence wasn't complete...

00:58:02.711 --> 00:58:05.077
and it might have spoiled
our chances of getting the others.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.445
- Next, Raine.
- I'd like a word with this orderly, uh, Harbin.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.780
- So would I.
- Well, bring him in.

00:58:10.885 --> 00:58:13.410
I can't.
He disappeared a week ago.

00:58:13.521 --> 00:58:15.921
This is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters.

00:58:16.024 --> 00:58:19.050
We have better witnesses.
Look here.

00:58:47.355 --> 00:58:51.348
- How could he have done it?
- Seventy pounds a tube.

00:58:51.459 --> 00:58:54.656
Go back to the hotel,
and do keep out of trouble.

00:58:54.763 --> 00:58:58.324
I'll try and fix things with the Austrian police.
You'll be all right in the hotel...

00:58:58.433 --> 00:59:00.594
but I can't be responsible
for you on the streets.

00:59:00.702 --> 00:59:03.933
- I'm not asking you to.
- I'm sorry, Martins.

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:05.973
I'm sorry too.

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:10.940
You still got that
airplane ticket on you?

00:59:11.046 --> 00:59:13.412
We'll send one across
to your hotel in the morning.

00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:15.881
Thank you.
Excuse me.

00:59:15.984 --> 00:59:18.612
Get me Austrian Police Headquarters.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.779
Can I have that woman's passport?

00:59:20.889 --> 00:59:23.551
You know, the Anna Schmidt one.

00:59:23.658 --> 00:59:26.889
Oh -We're not going to
pick her up for that, are we?

00:59:26.995 --> 00:59:30.658
What can we do?
We have our instructions.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:19.103
Me.

01:00:22.884 --> 01:00:24.784
It's me.

01:00:29.858 --> 01:00:31.758
Hello.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.885
What is it?
What's happened to you?

01:00:33.995 --> 01:00:35.724
Just came to see you.

01:00:37.632 --> 01:00:41.693
Come in. I thought you were going to
keep away. Are the police after you?

01:00:41.803 --> 01:00:43.703
I don't know.

01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:49.075
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- A bit. I'm sorry.

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:54.047
But I did want to say good-bye
before I pushed off.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.380
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

01:00:59.087 --> 01:01:02.614
It's what you've always wanted -
all of you.

01:01:03.725 --> 01:01:05.955
Kitty? Here, kitty.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.824
Kitty? Here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:12.388
Don't you want to play, kitty?
Aw, sleepy? Sleepy, kitty?

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:18.005
- Not very sociable, is he?
- No, he only liked Harry.

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:22.475
- What made you decide so suddenly?
- Uh, I brought you these.

01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:24.772
Uh, they got a little wet.

01:01:24.879 --> 01:01:27.871
- What happened to your hand?
- A parrot -

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:31.147
- Let it go.
- Have you seen Calloway?

01:01:32.754 --> 01:01:35.951
- Imagine a parrot nipping a man.
- Have you?

01:01:36.057 --> 01:01:38.184
It's -

01:01:38.293 --> 01:01:40.352
Oh, I - I -

01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:43.692
I've been saying good-bye
all over, you know.

01:01:43.798 --> 01:01:48.292
- He told you, didn't he?
- Told me?

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:52.203
- About Harry.
- Do you know?

01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:56.607
I've seen Major Calloway today.

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:40.321
He's better dead.

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:44.724
I knew he was mixed up,
but not like that.

01:02:44.826 --> 01:02:48.762
I knew him for 20 years -
at least, I thought I knew him.

01:02:48.863 --> 01:02:52.321
Suppose he was laughing
at fools like us all the time?

01:02:52.433 --> 01:02:56.096
- He liked to laugh.
- Seventy pounds a tube.

01:02:56.204 --> 01:03:00.334
He wanted me to write
for his great medical charity.

01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:02.602
I'll put these flowers in the water.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:06.407
Perhaps I could have raised
the price to 80 for him.

01:03:06.514 --> 01:03:10.109
Oh, please. For heaven's sake,
stop making him in your image.

01:03:10.218 --> 01:03:13.847
Harry was real. He wasn't
just your friend and my lover.

01:03:13.955 --> 01:03:17.755
- He was Harry.
- Well, don't preach wisdom to me.

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:19.827
You talk about him...

01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:23.353
as if he had occasional bad manners.

01:03:23.464 --> 01:03:27.958
No. I don't know. I'm just
a hack writer who drinks too much...

01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:31.129
and falls in love with girls.

01:03:33.007 --> 01:03:36.534
- You.
- Me?

01:03:36.644 --> 01:03:38.737
Don't be such a fool.
Of course.

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:43.714
If you'd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark...

01:03:43.818 --> 01:03:46.878
or had a mustache,
I wouldn't have known.

01:03:46.988 --> 01:03:48.888
Oh, I am leaving Vienna.

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:52.619
I don't care whether Harry
was murdered by Kurtz or Popescu...

01:03:52.727 --> 01:03:55.127
or the third man.

01:03:55.229 --> 01:03:59.962
Whoever killed him, there was
some sort of... justice.

01:04:01.002 --> 01:04:02.970
Maybe I would've killed him myself.

01:04:03.071 --> 01:04:05.471
A person doesn't change
because you find out more.

01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:10.909
Look. I've got a splitting headache,
and you stand there and just talk and talk and talk.

01:04:11.012 --> 01:04:13.640
I-I hate it.

01:04:13.748 --> 01:04:16.740
That's the first time
I ever saw you laugh.

01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:19.752
Do it again.

01:04:24.225 --> 01:04:26.625
There isn't enough for two laughs.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.604
I'd make comic faces and...

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:43.811
stand on my head and grin
at you between my legs and...

01:04:45.713 --> 01:04:47.704
tell all sorts of jokes.

01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:53.452
I wouldn't stand a chance, would I?

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.221
Hmm.

01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:06.499
Well...

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:12.667
you did tell me I ought
to find myself a girl.

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:45.501
What kind of a spy
do you think you are, satchel foot?

01:05:47.975 --> 01:05:50.500
What are you tailing me for?

01:05:52.847 --> 01:05:54.815
Cat got your tongue?

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:58.018
Come on out.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.585
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:07.522
Step out in the light,
and let's have a look at ya.

01:06:07.628 --> 01:06:10.791
- Who's your boss?

01:06:24.178 --> 01:06:25.736
Harry.

01:06:52.874 --> 01:06:54.569
Harry!

01:07:42.056 --> 01:07:43.956
I followed his shadow...

01:07:44.058 --> 01:07:45.958
until suddenly-

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.029
- Well?
- This is where he vanished.

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:52.327
- I see.
- I suppose you don't believe me.

01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:54.731
- No.
- Look. I tell you -

01:07:54.835 --> 01:07:57.030
- You don't think I'm blind, do you?
- Yes.

01:07:57.138 --> 01:08:00.005
- Where were you when you saw him first?
- Fifty yards right down there.

01:08:00.107 --> 01:08:03.042
- Which side of the road?
- I was on that side. His shadow was on that side.

01:08:03.144 --> 01:08:05.738
- And there are no turnings on either side.
- What about the doorways?

01:08:05.846 --> 01:08:08.076
- I tell you, I heard him running ahead of me!
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:08:08.182 --> 01:08:11.709
And then he vanished out there, I suppose,
with a puff of smoke and like a clap of-

01:08:29.937 --> 01:08:32.337
It wasn't the German gin.

01:09:00.601 --> 01:09:03.536
Well, what's this?
Where are we?

01:09:03.638 --> 01:09:05.606
It's the main sewer.

01:09:06.641 --> 01:09:10.441
Runs right into the blue Danube.
Smells sweet, doesn't it?

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:17.045
We should have dug deeper
than a grave.

01:10:04.799 --> 01:10:06.699
You knew him, Major?

01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:10.259
Hmm. Yes.

01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:12.362
Yes. Joseph Harbin.

01:10:12.473 --> 01:10:14.998
Medical orderly
at the general hospital.

01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:20.009
- He used to work for Harry Lime.
- Joseph Harbin?

01:10:20.114 --> 01:10:22.173
Yes.

01:10:22.283 --> 01:10:24.843
He's the man I told you was missing.

01:10:26.353 --> 01:10:28.821
Next time we'll have
a foolproof coffin.

01:11:32.052 --> 01:11:34.714
- Fraulein Schmidt?
- Ja.

01:12:38.485 --> 01:12:42.512
- Where are you taking me?
- International Police Headquarters, just to check up.

01:12:50.564 --> 01:12:53.965
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

01:12:54.068 --> 01:12:57.003
- I don't even know what protocol means.
- Neither do I, miss.

01:12:57.104 --> 01:13:00.164
Mademoiselle, your lipstick.

01:13:00.274 --> 01:13:02.174
Thank you.

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:17.149
- Anna, what's happened to you?
- All right. Keep out of this.

01:13:17.258 --> 01:13:20.284
Listen, I've got to talk to you.
I've just seen a dead man walking.

01:13:20.394 --> 01:13:23.955
- All right, chum. Get back.
- I saw him buried.

01:13:24.064 --> 01:13:26.828
And now I've seen him alive.

01:13:33.507 --> 01:13:35.941
Just a minute.
Bring her in here.

01:13:40.614 --> 01:13:42.809
You stay out here.

01:13:42.917 --> 01:13:44.885
Come in, Miss Schmidt.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.818
Now then, Miss Schmidt.
I'm not interested in your forged papers.

01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:50.823
That's purely a Russian case.

01:13:50.925 --> 01:13:54.156
- When did you last see Lime?
- Two weeks ago.

01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:56.525
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

01:13:57.631 --> 01:14:01.829
- It is true, then.
- Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.270
What did you say?
I'm sorry.

01:14:05.372 --> 01:14:07.840
I said another man
was buried in his place.

01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:10.843
Where's Harry?

01:14:10.945 --> 01:14:13.539
That's what we want to find out.

01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:18.880
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I -

01:14:19.987 --> 01:14:21.887
He is alive.

01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:24.048
Now this minute,
he is doing something.

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:28.151
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

01:14:28.262 --> 01:14:30.492
You may as well help us.
In a few minutes...

01:14:30.597 --> 01:14:33.031
Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you
about your papers.

01:14:33.133 --> 01:14:36.694
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

01:14:36.804 --> 01:14:39.102
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

01:14:40.341 --> 01:14:42.673
Martins always said you were a fool.

01:14:43.777 --> 01:14:47.304
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

01:14:47.414 --> 01:14:49.314
Poor Harry.

01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:52.882
I wish he was dead.

01:14:54.021 --> 01:14:56.455
He would be safe
from all of you then.

01:15:06.133 --> 01:15:09.432
Why, that's you!
Come up.

01:15:09.536 --> 01:15:12.334
Winkel, look who is here.

01:15:12.439 --> 01:15:14.339
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:16.932
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

01:15:17.044 --> 01:15:20.480
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:23.775
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

01:15:23.884 --> 01:15:27.479
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

01:15:28.956 --> 01:15:31.186
Be reasonable.
Come up and talk.

01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:34.886
No, thank you.
I like the open.

01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:37.759
Tell him I'll wait
by that wheel there.

01:15:39.366 --> 01:15:41.857
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr. Winkel?

01:15:43.504 --> 01:15:46.268
You got an opinion on that?

01:16:48.268 --> 01:16:52.034
- Hello, old man. How are you?
- Hello, Harry.

01:16:52.139 --> 01:16:54.767
Well, well, they seem to be
giving you quite some busy time.

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:56.775
- Well, listen.
- Hmm, yes?

01:16:56.877 --> 01:17:01.075
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk to me? Well, of course. Come on.

01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:06.249
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

01:17:06.353 --> 01:17:10.551
- But they haven't the money now, poor devils.

01:17:10.657 --> 01:17:13.558
Listen, Harry.
I didn't believe that -

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.254
- It's good to see you, Holly.
- I was at your funeral.

01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:18.797
That was pretty smart, wasn't it?

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:21.026
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:23.262
These are the only things
that help - these tablets.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:26.066
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe anymore.

01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:28.573
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

01:17:28.675 --> 01:17:31.371
- She's been arrested.
- Tough. Very tough. But don't worry, old man.

01:17:31.478 --> 01:17:34.106
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:36.409
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

01:17:36.517 --> 01:17:38.417
- You can help somehow.
- Holly...

01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:41.249
exactly who did you tell
about me, hmm?

01:17:41.355 --> 01:17:44.290
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:46.552
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.356
Did the, uh, police believe you?

01:17:49.463 --> 01:17:51.397
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

01:17:51.498 --> 01:17:53.398
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.934
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do? Be reasonable.

01:17:56.036 --> 01:17:58.698
- You can get somebody else -
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

01:17:58.805 --> 01:18:02.707
- Why not?
- "It's a far, far better thing that I do,"
the old limelight, the fall of the curtain -

01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:06.575
No. Holly, you and I aren't heroes.
The world doesn't make any heroes -

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.841
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- Outside of your stories.

01:18:08.949 --> 01:18:11.110
I've got to be so careful.

01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:14.585
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm
only safe as long as they can use me.

01:18:14.688 --> 01:18:17.782
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:21.349
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:23.395
Don't try to be a policeman,
old man.

01:18:23.497 --> 01:18:25.829
- What do you expect me to be? Part of your-
- Part?

01:18:25.933 --> 01:18:29.960
You can have any part you want as long as you don't
interfere. I've never cut you out of anything.

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:33.471
- Yes, I remember when they raided
the gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.
- Sure!

01:18:33.574 --> 01:18:36.475
Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

01:18:36.577 --> 01:18:41.207
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

01:18:41.315 --> 01:18:44.250
You ought to leave this thing alone.

01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:47.149
Have you ever seen
any of your victims?

01:18:47.254 --> 01:18:50.621
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

01:18:50.724 --> 01:18:53.215
Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:57.221
Tell me.

01:18:57.331 --> 01:19:02.132
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:05.399
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped...

01:19:05.505 --> 01:19:07.905
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

01:19:08.008 --> 01:19:12.001
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

01:19:12.112 --> 01:19:15.013
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax -

01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:17.811
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

01:19:17.918 --> 01:19:21.354
- A lot of good your money will do you in jail.
- That jail's in another zone.

01:19:22.589 --> 01:19:25.353
There's no proof against me...

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.359
besides you.

01:19:34.701 --> 01:19:36.828
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:42.106
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:45.042
I carry a gun.

01:19:45.145 --> 01:19:48.581
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

01:19:51.385 --> 01:19:53.444
They dug up your coffin.

01:19:57.291 --> 01:19:59.191
And found Harbin?

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.730
Mm-hmm.

01:20:07.901 --> 01:20:10.870
Pity.
Holly.

01:20:10.971 --> 01:20:13.531
What fools we are
talking to each other this way...

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.370
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

01:20:16.476 --> 01:20:19.240
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

01:20:19.346 --> 01:20:23.077
Nobody thinks in terms
of human beings.

01:20:23.183 --> 01:20:25.083
Governments don't.
Why should we?

01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:28.814
They talk about the people and the proletariat.
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:34.758
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:36.488
You used to believe in God.

01:20:37.631 --> 01:20:40.361
I still do believe in God, old man.

01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:45.198
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:47.637
But the dead are happier dead.

01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:50.801
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

01:20:54.514 --> 01:20:56.414
What do you believe in?

01:20:56.516 --> 01:20:59.952
Oh, if you ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

01:21:00.053 --> 01:21:02.021
I think you'll find she's worth it.

01:21:02.122 --> 01:21:05.182
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:09.023
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

01:21:09.129 --> 01:21:13.156
There's nobody left in Vienna I can really trust,
and we've always done everything together.

01:21:13.266 --> 01:21:16.633
When you make up your mind, send me a message.
I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

01:21:16.737 --> 01:21:19.672
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see...

01:21:19.773 --> 01:21:21.900
not the police.

01:21:22.008 --> 01:21:23.908
Remember that, won't you?

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:27.537
And don't be so gloomy.
After all, it's not that awful.

01:21:27.647 --> 01:21:30.081
Remember what the fella said:

01:21:30.183 --> 01:21:34.813
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had
warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed...

01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:38.516
but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.991
In Switzerland,
they had brotherly love.

01:21:41.094 --> 01:21:45.588
They had 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce?

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:48.463
The cuckoo clock.
So long, Holly.

01:21:56.743 --> 01:21:59.473
But look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at -

01:21:59.579 --> 01:22:02.104
at some little cafe here
in the international zone.

01:22:02.215 --> 01:22:04.274
- Wouldn't work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

01:22:04.384 --> 01:22:07.148
Calloway, you expect too much.

01:22:07.254 --> 01:22:10.189
Oh, I know he deserves to hang.
You've proved your stuff...

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.726
but 20 years is a long time.

01:22:13.827 --> 01:22:16.421
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:18.760
Okay. Forget it.

01:22:18.865 --> 01:22:21.993
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

01:22:22.102 --> 01:22:25.765
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

01:22:27.107 --> 01:22:29.268
I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

01:22:29.376 --> 01:22:32.812
We shall apply for her at
the Four Rower meeting tomorrow.

01:22:32.913 --> 01:22:35.507
She has no right to be here.

01:22:37.117 --> 01:22:39.950
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:43.716
That's a different case.
It is being looked into.

01:22:43.824 --> 01:22:46.190
- So long, Major.

01:22:46.293 --> 01:22:51.424
In the last war, a general would
hang his opponent's picture on the wall.

01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:53.624
He got to know him that way.

01:22:53.733 --> 01:22:56.600
I'm beginning to know Lime.

01:22:56.703 --> 01:23:00.764
I think this would've worked,
with your help.

01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:09.114
What price would you pay?

01:23:15.755 --> 01:23:18.189
Name it.

01:23:46.419 --> 01:23:49.047
Here we are.
You'll be all right here, miss.

01:23:52.692 --> 01:23:55.160
I don't understand
Major Calloway. I -

01:23:55.262 --> 01:23:59.130
- I expect he's got a soft spot for you, miss.
- Why has he done all this?

01:23:59.232 --> 01:24:03.168
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:05.238
There we are, miss.

01:24:05.338 --> 01:24:08.796
- Thank you. You've been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:13.535
- Good night, miss.
- Good-bye.

01:24:51.451 --> 01:24:53.442
Are you going too?

01:24:53.553 --> 01:24:55.521
Oh.

01:24:55.622 --> 01:24:58.887
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you off.

01:24:58.992 --> 01:25:00.721
See me off?
From here?

01:25:00.827 --> 01:25:03.318
Oh, I watched you onto the train, uh -

01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:06.991
- No harm in that, is there?
- How did you know I'd be here?

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.934
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

01:25:12.439 --> 01:25:14.407
Have you been seeing
Major Calloway again?

01:25:14.507 --> 01:25:17.271
Of course not.
I don't live in his pocket.

01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:20.578
Harry, what is it?

01:25:22.082 --> 01:25:25.051
- For heaven's sake, stop calling me Harry.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:27.210
- Come on.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.311
What's on your mind?
Why did you hide here?

01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:33.017
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here. It'll be cold on that train.

01:25:33.126 --> 01:25:35.651
- I shall be all right.
- You send me a wire as soon as you are.

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:38.526
- What's going to happen? Where is Harry?
- He's safe in the Russian zone.

01:25:38.632 --> 01:25:40.896
- How do you know?
- Well, I saw him today.

01:25:41.001 --> 01:25:43.401
- How is he?
- He can look after himself. Don't worry.

01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:46.370
- Did he say anything about me? Tell me!
- Oh, the usual things.

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:49.601
- Is something wrong?
Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
- Of course I didn't.

01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:52.303
Why should he help me?
The Russians will make trouble for him.

01:25:52.412 --> 01:25:55.245
- That's his headache. Oh, Anna!
- His? Why are you lying?

01:25:55.348 --> 01:25:57.976
- We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
- I'm not going.

01:25:58.084 --> 01:26:00.245
You'd -

01:26:00.353 --> 01:26:03.811
Anna, don't you recognize
a good turn when you see one?

01:26:03.923 --> 01:26:06.448
You have seen Calloway.
What are you two doing?

01:26:08.528 --> 01:26:12.464
Well, they-they asked me
to help take him.

01:26:12.565 --> 01:26:14.465
I'm helping.

01:26:23.643 --> 01:26:26.840
- Poor Harry.
- Poor Harry.

01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:33.114
Poor Harry... wouldn't even
lift a finger to help you.

01:26:33.219 --> 01:26:37.121
Oh, you've got your precious honesty
and don't want anything else.

01:26:37.223 --> 01:26:39.157
You still want him.

01:26:39.259 --> 01:26:41.386
I don't want him anymore.

01:26:41.494 --> 01:26:46.431
I don't want to see him, hear him, but
he's still a part of me. That's a fact.

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:48.831
I couldn't do a thing to harm him.

01:27:07.721 --> 01:27:13.023
Oh, Anna, why do we always...
have to quarrel?

01:27:13.126 --> 01:27:17.460
If you want to sell your services,
I'm not willing to be the price.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.328
I loved him.
You loved him.

01:27:23.436 --> 01:27:25.404
What good have we done him?

01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:27.473
Love.

01:27:28.508 --> 01:27:30.476
Look at yourself.

01:27:30.577 --> 01:27:33.876
They have a name
for faces like that.

01:27:55.268 --> 01:27:57.566
- Calloway.
- There you are. Come in here.
There isn't much time.

01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.901
I want to get a plane
out of here tonight.

01:28:01.007 --> 01:28:03.737
- So she talked you out of it.
- Gave me these.

01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:07.179
A girl of spirit.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.307
She's right.
It is none of my business.

01:28:11.417 --> 01:28:15.581
It won't make any difference
in the long run. I'll get him.

01:28:15.688 --> 01:28:20.091
- Well, I won't have helped.
- That'll be a fine boast to make.

01:28:20.193 --> 01:28:23.287
- Well, I always wanted you
to catch that plane, didn't I?
- You all did.

01:28:23.396 --> 01:28:28.095
I'd better see if there's anyone still at the terminus.
You may need a priority.

01:28:30.003 --> 01:28:32.267
Mind if I drop off
somewhere on the way?

01:28:32.372 --> 01:28:35.239
- I've got an appointment. It won't take five minutes.
- Of course.

01:28:35.341 --> 01:28:38.401
Why don't you come in too?
You're a writer. It might interest you.

01:28:39.712 --> 01:28:42.613
This is the biggest children's
hospital in Vienna.

01:28:42.715 --> 01:28:45.878
All the kids in here are the result
of Lime's penicillin racket.

01:29:06.539 --> 01:29:10.839
It had meningitis.
They gave it some of Lime's penicillin.

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:13.810
Terrible pity, isn't it?

01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:44.867
Paine lent me one of your books.
Oklahoma Kid, I think it was.

01:29:44.978 --> 01:29:47.538
I read a bit of it. Looks as if
it's gonna be pretty good.

01:29:47.647 --> 01:29:52.050
What made you take up this sort
of thing? Been doing it for long?

01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:55.382
- All right, Calloway. You win.
- I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas.

01:29:55.488 --> 01:29:58.457
- I said you win.
- Win what?

01:29:58.558 --> 01:30:03.120
I'll be your...
dumb decoy duck.

01:30:56.549 --> 01:30:58.449
Psst!

01:31:07.994 --> 01:31:09.894
Paine.

01:31:35.755 --> 01:31:37.655
Look, sir!

01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:46.330
How much longer
are you going to sit here?

01:31:46.432 --> 01:31:48.423
Shall I go over there, sir?

01:31:48.534 --> 01:31:51.435
No. No, leave them for a while.

01:32:11.057 --> 01:32:13.582
Mein Herr, Ballon?

01:32:13.693 --> 01:32:16.161
Nein, danke. Nein.

01:32:19.032 --> 01:32:21.330
- Ballon?

01:32:21.434 --> 01:32:24.369
Go on. Hop it. Scarper.

01:32:25.471 --> 01:32:29.202
- Ballon, mein Herr?

01:32:32.912 --> 01:32:34.846
Come on. Schnell. Schnell.

01:32:34.947 --> 01:32:38.610
All right, all right.
Only one. Go on. Scarper.

01:33:16.255 --> 01:33:20.055
You should have gone.
How did you know I was here anyway?

01:33:20.159 --> 01:33:23.617
From Kurtz.
They have just been arrested.

01:33:23.729 --> 01:33:26.596
But Harry won't come.
He's not a fool.

01:33:26.699 --> 01:33:30.863
- Yes, Paine. Slip over there. See what she's up to.
- Right, sir.

01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:33.495
Don't tell me you are doing all this for nothing.

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:38.442
- What's your price this time?
- No price, Anna.

01:33:38.544 --> 01:33:41.308
Honest, sensible, sober...

01:33:41.414 --> 01:33:43.712
harmless Holly Martins.

01:33:43.816 --> 01:33:46.944
Holly.
What a silly name.

01:33:47.053 --> 01:33:51.717
You must feel very proud
to be a police informer.

01:33:53.693 --> 01:33:56.218
Harry, get away!
The police are outside!

01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:58.461
- Quick!
- Anna.

01:34:04.971 --> 01:34:06.268
Sir, the back!

01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:09.166
All right.

01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:20.511
Martins, get back!

01:39:33.732 --> 01:39:35.632
Harry!

01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:39.600
- Is that you?
- You're through, Harry.

01:39:39.705 --> 01:39:41.764
Come out. You haven't
got a chance this way.

01:39:41.874 --> 01:39:44.240
- What do you want?
- You might as well give up.

01:39:45.044 --> 01:39:47.979
Mr. Martins, sir, get back!
Get back!

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.208
Keep back, sir!
Come back! Come back, sir!

01:41:26.779 --> 01:41:28.872
Martins! Martins!

01:41:28.981 --> 01:41:31.711
Be careful, Martins.

01:41:31.817 --> 01:41:35.082
Don't take any chances.
If you see him, shoot!

01:42:36.682 --> 01:42:38.650
What time is it?

01:42:38.751 --> 01:42:41.219
- 2:30.

01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:48.121
I'll have to step on it
if you're going to catch that plane.

01:42:48.227 --> 01:42:52.288
Calloway, can't you
do something about Anna?

01:42:52.398 --> 01:42:55.834
I'll do what I can,
if she'll let me.

01:43:06.111 --> 01:43:09.945
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- Well, there's not much time.

01:43:10.049 --> 01:43:13.951
One can't just leave.
Please.

01:43:15.087 --> 01:43:17.419
Be sensible, Martins.

01:43:17.523 --> 01:43:20.117
I haven't got a sensible name,
Calloway.
