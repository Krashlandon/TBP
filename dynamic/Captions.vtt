WEBVTT

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:54.623
The food is terrible. Worst
shit I've ever seen, man.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:57.167
What you say? You
got any biscuits over there?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.586
I keep seeing corn bread.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.799
- I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:09.262
- Right.
- Oh, I feel dead.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.223
Anybody ever tell you
you look dead, man?

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.145
Oh, yeah, right.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.314
Now, I just
forgot something, man.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.358
Before we dock,

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.443
I think we oughta discuss
the bonus situation.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.570
Right. Brett and I,
we think we oughta...

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.090
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- You see, Mr. Parker and I...

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.743
Feel that the bonus situation has
never been on an equitable level.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:35.080
Well, you'll get what you're
contracted for like everybody else.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.600
Yes, but everybody else gets
more than us.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.793
Dallas, mother
wants to talk to you.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.296
Huh? Yeah, I saw it. Yellow
light's for my eyes only.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.466
Okay, get dressed, huh?

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:50.011
Parker, come on. Can I
finish my coffee? Thank you.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.555
It's the only thing
good on this ship.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.070
Morning, mother.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.895
- Right.
- Okay.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.272
Plug us in.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.442
Thank you.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:34.240
- Where's earth?
- You should know.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:37.494
It's not our system.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.577
Scan.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.542
I can't believe this.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.879
Contact traffic control.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:52.342
This is commercial towing
vehicle nostromo out of the solomons.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.471
Registration number:
1-8—0—niner-2-4-6-0—niner.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:01.142
Calling Antarctica traffic
control. Can you read me? Over.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.479
Commercial towing vehicle
nostromo out of the solomons,

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.523
registration number...

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.613
Nothing. Keep trying.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:17.867
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:22.455
I found it. Just short of zeta ii
reticuli.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.044
We haven't reached the outer
rim yet. That's hard to believe.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:32.173
What the hell
are we doing out here?

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.009
I don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.513
- That's not our system.
- I know that.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:42.684
Do you ever
notice how they never come down here?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.894
I mean, this is where
the work is, right?

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.647
Well, it's the same damn reason
we get a half share to their one.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.816
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.818
No, but— listen, man.
Same old shit, man.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.028
I think I know why they
don't come down here.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.614
It's because of you.
You don't have no personality.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.411
Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.208
Um, you happen to be in my
seat. Can I have it? Yes, of course.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.211
Thank you. I'm sorry.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.801
What's happenin' now, baby?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.849
Well, some of you may have
figured out we're not home yet.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.310
- We're only halfway there.
- What?

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.771
Mother's interrupted
the course of our journey.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.773
Why? Yeah.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.902
She's programmed to do that should
certain conditions arise. They have.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:37.030
Like what? It seems she has...

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.324
Intercepted a transmission
of unknown origin.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.660
She got us up to check it
out. A transmission? Out here?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.496
Yeah.
What kind of a transmission?

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.250
Acoustical beacon. It repeats
at intervals of 12 seconds.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.211
I don't know.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.213
Human?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.174
Unknown. Well, so what?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.384
We are obligated
under section eight...

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.762
I hate to bring this up,
but, uh,

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.181
this is a commercial ship,
not a rescue ship.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:06.768
Right. And it's not in my
contract to do this kind of duty.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.730
And what about the money? If you wanna give
me some money, I'll be happy to oblige.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.149
The man's right. Let's go
over the bonus situation.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:17.153
- I'm sorry. Can I say something?
- Let's talk about the bonus more.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.864
There is a clause in the
contract which specifically states...

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.159
Any systematized transmission
indicating a possible intelligent origin...

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.963
Must be investigated.
I don't wanna hear it.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.223
We don't know if it's intelligent.
I wanna go home and party.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.540
Parker, will you
just listen to the man?

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.297
On penalty of total forfeiture
of shares. No money.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.217
You got that?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.054
- Well, yeah.
- All right, we're going in.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.056
Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:55.775
Approaching orbital apogee.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.778
Mark 12, 11...

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.281
Equatorial orbit nailed.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.659
Nine, eight seconds on descent.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.912
Grids energized.
Fields focused. Five. Four...

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.465
- D.o.r.'s on line.
- How's the status on the lifters?

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.051
Give me an ac pressure reading.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.352
Forty-eight seconds
and counting.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.980
Sr-1 stable.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.566
Prepare to disengage
from platform.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:41.446
Mark, 20
seconds. Eighteen, 17...

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:45.825
Twelve, 11, 10,

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.494
nine, eight, seven,

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.332
six, five, four,

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.835
three, two, one, lock.

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.754
Disengage.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.261
Umbilicus clear.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.643
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:19.484
Nine, eight, seven...

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.362
Roll 92 degrees port yaw.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.322
Prime to port.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.012
Prime ventral. Prime dorsal.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.514
Down a degree.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.350
39, 000 meters.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:06.322
Turbulence.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.374
Locked and floating. You can drop
us anytime now. We'll catch you.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:21.337
Inertial damping's going off. Hold on,
people. There's gonna be a little bump.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.221
What the hell was that?

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.807
Pressure drop in intake three.
Must've lost a shield.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.600
Let's go with it.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:44.485
Dropping off now.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.865
Still dropping.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.535
Here we are. We've got it.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.413
Take her down.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.463
Navigation lights on.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:15.141
We've got 5-3 still out.
No problem. Just down 11%.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.768
Grid status okay.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.831
Nine,

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:42.335
eight, seven, six,

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.464
five, four, three,

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.466
two, one.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.593
Kill drive engines.

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:11.405
What the hell happened?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:15.993
Somebody
give me a straight answer!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:20.122
- Is the hull breached?
- I don't see anything. We've still got pressure.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.793
- Hit the screen.
- Right.

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:34.804
Secondary load sharing unit...

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.806
Is out.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.017
Three to four cells are gone.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:45.481
Is that it? No, hold on.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.859
We can't fix it out here
anyway, and we need to reroute...

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:52.488
A couple of these ducts, wouldn't
you say, Brett? Dry dock time.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.907
Dry dock.
Tell her we need to dry-dock.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.909
Look, we couldn't fix it
out here anyway.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.911
We gotta reroute
all these ducts,

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.622
and in order to do that
we've got to dry-dock.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.958
What else?

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.960
Some fragments kicked up,

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.379
and we've got to clean it
all out and repressurize it.

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.923
How
long before we're functional?

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:15.469
Look, what is— what—
It's 17 hours, tell her.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.306
At least 25 hours. Yeah.

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:20.808
Get started on the
floor panel. I'll be right down.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.935
What the hell's
she comin' down here for?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.080
She better stay the fuck
out of my way, I'll tell you that.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.857
I'd like to see what she's
gonna do when she gets here.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:41.621
Any response yet? [Ash
I no. Absolutely nothing.

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:44.874
Except the same
transmission every 12 seconds.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.959
All the other channels are dead.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:55.051
Kick on the floods.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:13.569
We can't go
anywhere in this. Mmm.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.946
Well, mother says the sun's
coming up in 20 minutes.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:19.408
How far are we from the source
of transmission? Uh, northeast.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.911
Just under 2,000 meters.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.497
Walking distance?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.124
Well...

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.336
Can you give me
an atmospheric? Yes.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.424
Oh.

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.803
It's almost primordial.

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.930
There's inert nitrogen,

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.683
high concentration of carbon
dioxide crystals, methane.

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.685
I'm working on
the trace elements.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:47.895
Anything else? Yes.

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.897
It's...

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.358
Rock, lava base,

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.360
and deep cold.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:58.364
Well below the line. Mm-hmm.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.117
I'll volunteer to be
in the first group to go out.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.953
Yeah, that figures.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.831
You too, lambert.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.459
Swell. Better
break out the weapons.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.453
I can't see a goddamn thing.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.915
Ash, are you receiving?

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.047
Good contact on my board.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.384
Clear and
free. Keep the line open. Let's go.

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.568
Hey, Ripley.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.612
Hey, Ripley,
I wanna ask you a question.

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:06.968
If they find what they're lookin' for out
there, does that mean we get full shares?

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:11.247
Don't worry, Parker. You'll
get whatever's coming to you.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.874
Look, I'm not gonna do
any more work...

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.877
Till we get this
straightened out. Brett,

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:20.589
you're guaranteed bylaw to
get a share. What?

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.801
- Why don't you just fuck off.
- What?

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:26.345
What'd you say, rip?

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:29.932
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:34.186
Hey, Ripley, come back here!

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:42.194
Son of a bitch.
What's the matter?

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.915
Can't see a goddamn thing.

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:57.751
Quit griping. I like griping.

00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.879
Come on. Knock it off.

00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.766
How's it going?

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.979
All right.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:19.398
Have you tried putting that
transmission through e.C.I.U.?

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.568
No.
Mother hasn't identified it yet.

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:24.987
You mind if I give it
a shot? Please do.

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.565
Ash, can you see this?

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.859
Yes, I can.

00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:50.990
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:02.418
Very bizarre.

00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:07.673
You said it.

00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:18.767
All right.

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:21.395
Moving on to second... position.

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:24.064
What is it?

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.901
Let's get out of here.

00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:30.654
We've got
this far. We must go on.

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:32.698
We have to go on.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:39.538
Will you say that again? Shit.

00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:44.877
Ash, as you can
see, it's kind of hard to describe.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.629
I'm going back to the console.

00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.813
Seems to be solid.

00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.483
To walk— you can on it.

00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:43.227
Dallas?

00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:48.524
Dallas?

00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:43.745
Come on down here.
Something different down here.

00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:47.666
I don't know what it is, but...

00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:51.253
See if we can get up that wall. If we
can get up that wall, we can find out.

00:28:58.237 --> 00:29:00.239
Amazing.

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.826
Alien life-form.

00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:09.164
Looks like it's been dead
a long time.

00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:11.917
Fossmzed.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.962
Looks like it's grown
out of the chair.

00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:32.813
Bones are bent outward,

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:35.983
like he exploded from inside.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.448
Wonder what
happened to the rest of the crew.

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:50.914
Let's get the hell out of here.

00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:05.012
Hey, Dallas, lambert,
come on over here.

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.809
Come on.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.861
What do you got?
See what you make of this.

00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:30.454
Ash.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:33.957
That transmission—
Mother's deciphered part of it.

00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:36.501
It doesn't look like an s. O. S.
What is it, then?

00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:39.921
Well, I—
It looks like a warning.

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:42.591
I'm gonna go out after them.
What's the point?

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:48.680
I mean, by the time it
takes to get there, you'll...

00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:51.224
They'll know if it's
a warning or not, yes?

00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:20.337
You okay down there?

00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:27.594
Can you see anything?
Uh... a cave.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:31.848
A ca— a cave of some sort.
But I...

00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:36.812
Well, I don't know, but it's like
the goddamn tropics in here.

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:42.275
What the hell is this?

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:21.440
The cave is completely enclosed,

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.900
and it's full of...

00:32:23.984 --> 00:32:27.821
Leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:48.091
There's a layer of mist...

00:32:48.175 --> 00:32:52.179
Just covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.310
Kane? You all right?

00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:00.937
I'm okay. All right.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.358
I'm okay. I just slipped.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:28.423
Appears to be completely sealed.

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:56.451
Wait a minute. There's movement.

00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:02.040
It seems to have life.
Organic life.

00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:09.065
You
there, Ripley? I'm right here.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.700
Okay, Ripley, I'm at the
inner lock hatch now. Right.

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:31.296
Ripley. We're clean.
Let us in. Right here.

00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:34.132
- What happened to Kane?
- Something has attached itself to him.

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:37.761
- We have to get him to the infirmary right away.
- What kind of thing?

00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:40.096
I need a clear definition.
An organism. Open the hatch.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.641
Wait a minute. If we let it
in, the ship could be infected.

00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:46.519
You know the quarantine procedure—
24 hours for decontamination.

00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:48.480
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.

00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:51.399
Listen to me. If we break
quarantine, we could all die.

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:55.820
Look, would you open the goddamn
hatch? We have to get him inside.

00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:59.407
No. I can't do that.

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.910
And if you were in my
position, you'd do the same.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.971
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch right now.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:05.872
Do you hear me? Yes.

00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:07.999
Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?

00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:11.836
Yes, I read you.
The answer is negative.

00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.924
Inner hatch opened.

00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:45.620
My god.

00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:57.841
What the hell is that?

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:01.386
How is he?

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:07.142
How are we gonna
get that off him?

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.687
How are we gonna get it off?
I'm gonna get some instruments.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:16.609
My god.

00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:22.866
Right.
I'll make an incision here.

00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:28.413
Try and remove one of the
digitals from— you're gonna do what?

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:31.583
Finger. I'm gonna try and
get his finger off. Just a minute.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.508
No, that's not— it's
tearing his scalp. I know!

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:44.888
It's not coming off without
tearing his face off with it.

00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.811
We'll have to take a
look at him inside. Right.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:53.104
How come they don't freeze him?

00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.107
How come
you guys don't freeze him?

00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:14.209
All right, you can
take your mask off.

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:38.608
- What's it got down his throat?
- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.

00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:43.238
Paralyzes him, puts him in a
coma, then keeps him alive.

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:46.157
Now what the hell is that?

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.201
We gotta get it off
of him. Just a minute.

00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:50.203
Just a minute.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:52.747
I mean, let's not be too hasty.

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:54.999
We don't know anything about_

00:38:57.126 --> 00:39:00.338
Now, we're assuming it's feeding
him oxygen. If we remove it,

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.591
it could kill him.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.447
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:12.183
You'll take responsibility? Yes, I'll
take responsibility. Get him out of there.

00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:16.062
Where do you wanna do this?

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:19.315
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle there.

00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:21.025
Right here. Stand by.

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:31.870
Good god!

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:38.543
That crap's
gonna eat through the hull.

00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:42.797
That thing's gonna eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on!

00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:45.425
What's going on?

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.510
This way.

00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:57.687
Next deck.

00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:17.123
There it is.

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:20.835
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.676
Looks like it's stopping.

00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:33.473
Take a look at this, man. Yeah.

00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:37.101
Brett, give me— what do you got,
a pen there? Give it to me, quick.

00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:39.354
Come on! Come on!

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.652
Don't get any on your arm.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.703
It stopped.

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:59.832
Don't see anything like that
except, uh, molecular acid.

00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:03.002
It must be using it for blood.

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:05.004
It's got a wonderful
defense mechanism.

00:41:05.088 --> 00:41:07.298
You don't dare kill it.

00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.258
What about Kane?

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:14.681
- Here's your pen back.
- What do we do now?

00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:17.892
Leave Kane to ash.
You get back to work.

00:41:20.103 --> 00:41:22.021
Well, what...

00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:33.282
Okay.

00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:36.244
Try it.

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:42.333
Damn it. I thought
sure that was it.

00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:45.670
Try it again.

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:48.339
I feel like I've been
in this place a month.

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.385
We shouldn't have landed
in this place in the first place.

00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:58.349
Shouldn't have landed on
this damn ball, I know that.

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:02.186
Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and
get out of here, the sooner we can go home.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.604
This place gives me the creeps.

00:43:08.336 --> 00:43:10.838
That's amazing. What is it?

00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:15.593
Ah, yes, it is. Um...

00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:17.845
I don't know yet.

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:23.476
Did you want something?

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.853
Yes. I, uh...

00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:30.608
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh— how's Kane?

00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:33.277
He's holding. No changes.

00:43:33.361 --> 00:43:37.990
And, uh, our guest?

00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:40.993
Wdf hmm?

00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:42.954
Well, as I said, I'm still...

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.997
Collating, actually, but, uh,

00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:49.127
I have confirmed that he's got an
outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:53.172
He has a funny habit
of shedding his cells...

00:43:53.256 --> 00:43:57.135
And replacing them with...
Polarized silicon,

00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:59.303
which gives him
a prolonged resistance...

00:43:59.387 --> 00:44:03.307
To adverse
environmental conditions.

00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:05.434
Is that enough for you?
That's plenty.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.813
What does it mean? Please
don't do that. Thank you.

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:11.983
I'm sorry.

00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:14.026
Well, it's an interesting
combination of elements,

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:18.573
making him
a tough little son of a bitch.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:21.033
And you let him in.

00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:23.494
I was obeying
a direct order, remember?

00:44:23.578 --> 00:44:27.665
Ash, when Dallas and Kane
are off the ship,

00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:29.834
I'm senior officer.

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:32.837
Oh, yes. I forgot.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.340
You also forgot the science
division's basic quarantine law.

00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:38.593
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.345
You just broke it. Huh?

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:45.057
Look, what would you
have done with Kane? Hmm?

00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:48.436
You knew his only chance of
survival was to get him in here.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.938
Unfortunately,
by breaking quarantine,

00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:53.024
you risk everybody's life.

00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:56.194
Maybe I should've
left him outside.

00:44:56.277 --> 00:45:00.072
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.366
That's a pretty big risk...

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.368
For a science officer.

00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:07.788
It's, uh, not exactly
out of the manual, is it?

00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:12.627
I do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you, you know.

00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:15.713
You do your job...

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.882
And let me do mine, yes?

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:53.376
J'j'

00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:57.838
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:00.508
[J'j' I beep]

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.513
Dallas. I think you
should have a look at Kane.

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:09.600
Why? Something's happened.

00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:12.728
Serious? Interesting.

00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:17.191
J'j'

00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:19.193
Ripley, meet me
in the infirmary right away.

00:46:23.364 --> 00:46:25.324
Where is it?

00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:28.244
Well, I don't know. I
mean, we ought to try and find it.

00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:30.246
Yeah, let's check it.

00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:59.191
Dallas, please be careful.

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.568
Sorry.

00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:18.604
No, not in the corner.
Psst. Have one of these.

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:22.149
Just in case.

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:38.082
Kane? Dallas?

00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:45.381
You okay? I didn't see
it. Was it in the overhead?

00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:49.301
What? It was up there
somewhere. My god.

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:52.513
Cover up the damn thing! Wait.

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:55.099
That's alive!

00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:57.184
That's a reflex action.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.021
Well, we've gotta
have a look at this.

00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:15.077
Excuse me.

00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:24.462
- Seems dead enough.
- Well, good. Let's get rid of it.

00:49:26.005 --> 00:49:28.507
Ripley, for god's sake,

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:32.011
this is the first time that we've
encountered a species like this.

00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:34.638
It has to go back. All sorts
of tests have to be made.

00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:37.183
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.

00:49:37.266 --> 00:49:40.019
Who knows what it's
gonna do when it's dead.

00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:43.314
Think it's safe to assume
it isn't a zombie.

00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:46.066
Dallas, it has to go back.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.652
Well, I'd soon...

00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:51.238
As not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.656
It's your decision, ash. Dallas.

00:49:54.033 --> 00:49:56.428
How come I've got to change my
mind? The decision's been made.

00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:58.930
I'm not trying to change your
mind, Dallas. I just want you to listen...

00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:00.873
Will you listen to...

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.562
Just tell me how you can
leave that kind of decision to him.

00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.588
Look, I just run the ship.

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.233
Anything that has to do with the
science division, ash has the final word.

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:13.612
- How does that happen?
- It happens, my dear, because that's what the company wants to happen.

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:16.347
Since when is that
standard procedure?

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.099
Standard procedure is to do
what the hell they tell you to do.

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:21.268
Did you ever ship out
with ash before?

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:24.605
I went out five times
with another science officer.

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.692
They replaced him two days before
we left thedus with ash. Hmm?

00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:33.197
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust anybody.

00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:37.076
What's happening with the repairs? How's
it going? They're pretty much finished now.

00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.078
Why the hell
didn't you tell me so?

00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:41.747
- Because there's still some things left to do.
- Like what?

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.208
Well, we 're blind
on “b” and “c” decks.

00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:47.169
The reserve power system's
blown— that's a bunch of horseshit.

00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:50.422
We can take off without that. Yeah,
we can. You think that's a good idea?

00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:53.384
Look, I just wanna get the
hell out of here, all right?

00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:20.202
Dust in the intakes again.
Number two's overheating.

00:51:20.286 --> 00:51:22.580
Spit on it for two minutes,
would you, for Christ's sake?

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.417
We 're hot.
We 're getting hotter.

00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:32.798
Engine room, red clip status?

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:36.885
Engage artificial gravity.

00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:40.514
Engaged.
I'm altering the vector now.

00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:46.895
Inhibit c. N. G. Control.

00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:54.820
Struts retract. Struts retracted.

00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:59.033
Max stress to fifth overload.

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.535
Ease it back.

00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:04.705
She's great. Beautiful.

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:19.345
Walk in the park. When we
fix something, we stay fixed.

00:52:19.428 --> 00:52:22.181
Don't we, Brett baby? Right.

00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.549
What I think we
should do is just freeze him.

00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.867
If he's got a disease, why
don't we stop it where it is?

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.579
- He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.
- Right.

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:49.375
Whenever he says anything, you
say “right,” Brett. You know that?

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:51.627
Right.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.648
Parker, what do you think? Your staff
just follows you around, says “right.”

00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:57.091
- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah. Shape up.

00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.177
- What are you, some kind of parrot?
- Right.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.263
Come on. Knock it off! Kane's
gonna have to go into quarantine.

00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:06.141
That's it. Yes, and so will we.

00:53:06.225 --> 00:53:08.477
Well, how about a little
something to lower your spirits?

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.646
Thrill me, will you, please?

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.648
Well, according
to my calculations,

00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:14.751
based on time spent getting
to and from the planet...

00:53:14.775 --> 00:53:18.028
Just give me the short version.
How far to earth? Ten months.

00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:20.114
Oh, god. Great.

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:21.990
Yes.

00:53:22.074 --> 00:53:24.114
Dallas, I think you
should come and see Kane.

00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:26.262
Has his condition changed? It's
simpler if you'd just come and see him.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:27.366
We're on our way.

00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:33.752
Right.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.507
How are you doing?

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:43.554
Thank you. How you doin'?

00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:45.848
Um, terrific.
Next silly question.

00:53:49.435 --> 00:53:51.478
Oh, thank you.

00:53:53.522 --> 00:53:56.150
Do you remember anything
about the planet?

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.488
What's the last thing
you do remember?

00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.242
Huh?

00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:10.330
I remember some...

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:13.083
Horrible dream about...
Smothering.

00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:14.960
And...

00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:17.546
And— anyway, where are we?

00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:20.007
Right here.
We're on our way home.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.176
Back to the old freezerinos.

00:54:24.344 --> 00:54:26.513
Could I have something to eat
before we go back?

00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:28.432
I-I need something myself.

00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:32.186
Yeah, right. One more meal
before bedtime. I'm buyin'.

00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:35.314
Hey, that's a break. Bedtime.

00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:57.628
The first thing that I'm
gonna do when I get back...

00:54:57.711 --> 00:54:59.713
Is to get some decent food.

00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:02.508
I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,
I've eaten worse food than this,

00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:05.361
but then I've tasted better, you know
what I'm sayin'? The other one over there.

00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:08.472
Well, you pound down the
stuff like there's no tomorrow.

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:11.850
I'd rather be eatin' something else,
but, uh, right now I'm thinkin' food.

00:55:11.934 --> 00:55:15.854
Well, you should know.
You know what it's made of.

00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:18.982
No, man, I don't wanna talk
about what it's made of.

00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:21.026
I'm eatin' this just to...

00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:24.321
What's the matter?

00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.698
The food ain't that bad,
baby. What's wrong, Kane?

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.700
Are you choking?

00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:30.661
What's wrong?

00:55:32.454 --> 00:55:34.623
What? What?

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:37.751
- This is serious.
- Kane, what's the matter?

00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:41.839
It's okay!

00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:45.551
Hold him down! Hold him...

00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:47.761
Get the spoon in!

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:51.431
Damn it!

00:55:51.557 --> 00:55:53.809
Get it into his mouth!
I'm trying!

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.549
Oh, my god! Oh, god!

00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:35.726
No! Don't touch
it! Don't touch it!

00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:54.494
Dallas?

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:57.164
Dallas? Yeah.

00:56:57.247 --> 00:57:01.084
Anything? No. You?

00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.545
Nothing.

00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:06.214
You see anything?

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.584
[ Dallas I inner hatch sealed.

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:48.674
Anybody wanna say anything?

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:28.630
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:30.632
It's got a portable battery.

00:58:30.716 --> 00:58:33.427
It's insulated all the way
here, all the way up to here.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.471
Just make damn sure nobody
puts their hand on the end of it.

00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.935
It shouldn't damage
the little bastard,

00:58:42.019 --> 00:58:44.521
unless its skin's
thinner than ours.

00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:48.775
But it will give him
a little incentive.

00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:50.902
Now we just have to find it.

00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:54.781
I've taken care of that. I've
designed this tracking device.

00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:59.286
You just set it to search
for a moving object, like so.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.931
Hasn't got much of a range, but
when you get within a certain distance,

00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.999
it'll start
to give off a signal.

00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:07.169
What's it key on?

00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:11.006
Micro changes in air density.

00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:13.467
Give me a demo.

00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:18.805
See? Again.

00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:21.224
Got ya.

00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:24.811
Two teams. Ash, lambert and I.

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:28.315
Ripley, you take
Parker and Brett.

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.901
Now, anyone see this thing,
you catch it in the net...

00:59:30.984 --> 00:59:33.111
That Parker's holding
on his lap.

00:59:33.195 --> 00:59:36.114
Parker, I don't want any
heroics out of you, all right?

00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:39.618
Catch it, put it in the
airlock, get rid of it.

00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:41.620
Now, channels are open
on all decks.

00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:45.791
I want you to communicate,
keep in touch at all times, all right?

00:59:45.874 --> 00:59:47.876
Let's go.

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:04.101
I thought you fixed 12 module.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.561
We did.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.688
Idont understand it.

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:12.859
The circuits
must have burned out.

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:28.625
What do we got here? Damn it!
Hold your light over here, would you?

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.627
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.631
I don't know if this
is gonna work.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:37.342
If I could just put this—
Put this in there.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:40.220
Right. Oh, damn it.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.475
Check the insulation.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.894
Oh, shit!

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.587
Steady. According to
this, it's within five meters.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.923
[I Ripley] Open the door.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:24.389
Micro changes
in air density, my ass.

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:32.022
It's within five meters.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.940
Be careful.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.698
Christ. Don't do that.
Don't creep up on me with that thing.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.475
You guys, stick together.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:27.661
- Don't fail me now.
- What?

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.955
What is it? Parker,
Brett, it's in this locker!

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.957
Where?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.042
Here, take this.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.544
Get over there and get the net.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.381
Get it? I got it.
I got it. I got it.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:42.050
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.888
All right, Parker. When I say.

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:50.475
All right. Now.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:52.560
Easy.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.858
Wait! Don't let him go!

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.152
What the hell
are you doing, man?

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.154
It's the cat.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.455
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.750
Now we might pick it
up on the tracker again.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.128
I'ii— I'ii— I'll—
Go and get it, man.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.006
All right. You get
him. We'll go on.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.936
Here, kitty!

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.355
Here, kitty, kitty!

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:39.983
Enough of that kitty crap.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:44.029
Jones.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.031
Jonesy?

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.116
Here, jonesy.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:57.792
Jonesy?

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.300
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.184
Here, jonesy.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.864
Jonesy?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.461
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.217
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:15.180
Here, jonesy.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.390
Jonesy.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.478
Kitty, kitty.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.362
Jonesy?

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.913
Hey. Hey. Come on, jonesy.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.290
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.752
That's a kitty. Come on, baby.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.630
That's a kitty.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:34.592
Hey, hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.678
Come on.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.675
Whatever it was, it was—
It was big and...

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.431
You're sure it took him
into the air shaft?

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.641
Disappeared into
one of the cooling ducts.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:26.060
No question, it's— it's using
the air ducts to move around.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.358
Could he want Brett alive?

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:36.362
What? Could Brett be alive?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.115
No. I mean, I don't think so.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:43.119
Well, this air shaft may
work to our advantage.

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:47.999
Here it leads up to and
comes out in the main airlock.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.376
All right. There's only one
big opening along the way.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.796
We can cover that up,
and then we...

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.382
Drive it into the airlock
and zap it into outer space.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.843
This son of a bitch is huge!

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.263
- I mean, it's like a man. It's big!
- Kane's son.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:07.185
Come on, ash. Science
department should be able to help us.

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.646
What can we do to drive it?

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.023
Yes, well, it's adapted
remarkably well to our atmosphere,

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.233
considering its
nutritional requirements.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.920
- The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
- Okay. What about temperature?

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:19.656
- What happens if we change it?
- Let's try it.

01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:23.034
I mean, most animals
retreat from fire. Yes?

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:25.578
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig...

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.164
Three or four incinerator units?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.833
Give me about 20 minutes.
I'll do it.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.585
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:39.050
No. You and ash...

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:41.344
Take the main air lock.

01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:45.598
Parker, lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening, please.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.642
Right.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.909
- I'm at the first junction.
- Dallas, I'm right here.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:31.788
- Parker? - Yeah?
- Lambert?

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.165
We're in position. I'm just
trying to get a reading here.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.001
- The airlock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:39.754
Ready.

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.849
All right. I've got
a reading on you now.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:32.265
Uh, open the hatch
to the third junction.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.616
Okay, I'm through.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.618
Ripley? Yes.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.538
Close all the hatches behind me.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.790
I'm moving on.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.682
Dallas, hold
it a minute. I think I got it.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:19.437
Yes, I've got it. Where?

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.274
It's somewhere around
the third junction.

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:25.359
Okay, moving on.

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:48.257
It is right around there. Now, Dallas,
you're gonna have to be careful.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.606
All right. I've reached...

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:07.526
The third junction,
and I'm going down.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.964
The hell's the matter
with that box?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.842
Dallas, you're gonna have to
hold your position for a minute. I...

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:33.970
I've lost the signal.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.973
What? You sure?

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:41.143
Look around. Are you sure it's not there?
It's got to be around there somewhere.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:49.193
Checked it out, lambert.
You may be getting interference.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.171
Dallas, are you
sure there's no sign of it?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:55.908
I mean, it is there.
It's gotta be around there.

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:02.707
- Dallas?
- God, what is happening?

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.543
All right.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:14.051
Uh, am I— am I clear, lambert?
I want to get the hell out of here.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.806
Oh, god. It's
moving right towards you.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:31.318
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.530
Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:38.284
Get out! Move!

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.994
The other way!

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.748
Dallas?

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.583
Oh, no. Take it easy.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.793
Dallas?

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.468
We found this laying there.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:59.388
No blood.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:02.850
No Dallas. Nothing.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:11.567
How come I don't hear nobody
saying nothing? I'm thinking.

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:19.241
Unless somebody has got
a better idea,

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.577
we'll proceed
with Dallas's plan.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.414
What? And end up
like the others?

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.917
Ohh. No, you're
out of your mind.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.254
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:34.590
We get the shuttle and
just get the hell out of here.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.635
We take our chances
and just hope that...

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.595
Somebody picks us up. Lambert.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.432
The shuttle won't take four. Then
why don't we draw straws and...

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:46.560
I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for
killing that goddamn thing right now.

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.729
Okay.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:50.916
Well, let's talk about
killing it.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:54.110
We know it's using the air shafts—
Will you listen to me, Parker?

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.987
Shut up! Let's hear it.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.989
Let's hear it.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:02.284
It's using the air shafts.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:05.162
We don't know that.
That's the only way.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:08.332
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:11.335
And cut off every
bulkhead and every vent...

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:14.672
Until we have it cornered, and then
we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.924
Is that acceptable to you?

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:22.138
If it means killing it, it's acceptable
to me. Obviously it means killing it.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.014
But we have to stick together.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.811
How are our weapons?
The weapons are fine.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:32.815
This one needs refueling.
Will you get it, please?

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:36.986
Ash, go with him. No,
no. I can manage, ash.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.071
Don't follow me.

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.577
Ash?

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:48.414
Any suggestions
from you or mother?

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:54.170
No, we're still collating.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.505
You're what?

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:58.799
You're still collating?

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.927
I find that hard to believe.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:07.183
What would you like me to do?
Just what you've been doing, ash.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:10.186
Nothing. I've got
access to mother now,

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:13.272
and I'll get
my own answers, thank you.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:18.402
All right.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:11.724
There is an explanation
for this, you know.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:15.728
Is there really? I don't wanna
hear your goddamn explanation!

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:20.983
I want— I want...

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:26.739
I want— I w...

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.755
Parker. Lambert?

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:54.433
Ash, open the door.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:06.070
Ash...

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.950
Will you open the door?

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:16.830
Let me by, ash.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.993
Yaah!

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.373
The hell are you doing?

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.674
Aah!

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.020
Get her up. Get her up. Get her up.
Get her up. Get her up. Get her up.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:16.700
Android! He's an Android!

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.509
Jesus!

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.973
It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot!

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:44.144
God!

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:50.275
Oh! Get off me— oh!

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.319
Holy shit!

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:56.907
Help! Help me get
this fucking thing off!

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:03.080
Aah!

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.792
God! Jesus! Oh, god! Oh, god!

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:14.550
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:18.387
All I can think of is they must've wanted
the alien for their weapons division.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.223
He's been protecting it
right along.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.600
Parker, will you plug it in?

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:28.564
I don't know why—
Because he may know how to kill it.

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.802
Ash, can you hear me?

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.640
Ash?

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.525
Yes, I can hear you.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:23.535
- What was your special order?
- You read it. I thought it was clear.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:27.623
- What was it?
- Bring back life-form.

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:32.377
Priority one. All other
priorities rescinded.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.093
The damn company! What
about our lives, you son of a bitch?

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:44.139
I repeat: All other priorities
are rescinded.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.600
How do we kill it, ash?

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:50.103
There's got to be a way of
killing it. How— how do we do it?

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:52.981
You can't.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:58.570
- That's bullshit!
- You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.532
A perfect organism.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:08.955
Its structural perfection is
matched only by its hostility.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.208
You admire it.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.422
I admire its purity.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.679
A survivor...

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:30.018
Unclouded by conscience,

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:33.730
remorse or delusions
of morality.

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:38.402
Look, I— I've
heard enough of this,

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.904
and I'm asking you
to pull the plug.

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:44.324
Last word. What?

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:50.205
I can't lie to you
about your chances, but...

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.877
You have my sympathies.

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:01.341
We're gonna blow up the ship.

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:04.219
We'll take our chances
in the shuttle.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.638
Blow up the ship. Good.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.724
Come on.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:39.045
When we throw the switches, how
long before the ship blows? Ten minutes.

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.339
No bullshit. If we ain't
outta here in ten minutes,

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:45.093
we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:48.346
We're gonna need coolant
for the air support system.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:03.361
You two go down, get all
the coolant you can carry.

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:06.364
I'll get the shuttle
ready. I'll give you about...

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.742
About seven minutes.

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:11.203
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off,

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.163
and we'll blow this fucker
off into space.

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:14.956
Okay. All right. Come on.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.666
Ready? Take care of yourself.

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.418
Seven minutes.

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:58.208
Take it easy.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.714
Jones.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.597
Jones?

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:29.758
Okay, check the bottles.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.940
Jones?

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:50.904
How you doin'? Fine.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:53.990
Kitty.

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:56.034
Okay. Go ahead.

01:30:58.203 --> 01:31:00.330
Jones?

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:07.295
Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.756
Come here, Jones. Come here.

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:11.967
Jones?

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.223
Come here, boy.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.100
Come here.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:22.602
Nice kitty.

01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.646
Jones?

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.399
Jones?

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:34.280
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:37.325
Jones.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:48.420
Jones? Jones?

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.257
Jones?

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:59.931
Jones! Goddamn it!

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:06.062
Now I got you.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:14.154
Here, sweetie. Nice kitty.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:38.845
Oh, my god.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.390
- Get out of the way.
- I can't get out of the way!

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:45.310
Get out of the way, lambert!
It's gonna kill us!

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:48.146
I can't!

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:51.399
Lambert, for Christ's sake, get
out of the way! Parker? Lambert...

01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:04.162
Get out of the way, lambert!

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.164
Parker? Lambert?

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:10.418
Lambert? Parker?

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:42.117
Get outta the room!

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:05.390
Oh, god!

01:34:20.113 --> 01:34:22.240
Parker?

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:59.754
Danger. The emergency
destruct system...

01:35:59.837 --> 01:36:02.173
Is now activated.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:05.426
The ship will detonate
in t-minus...

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:08.680
Ten minutes.

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:11.933

automatic detonation...

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:16.271
Expires in t-minus five minutes.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:19.167

come on! Three, two, one.

01:38:55.555 --> 01:38:58.975
The option to override
detonation procedure...

01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:01.060
Has now expired.

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:06.858
Mother? I've turned
the cooling unit back on.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:09.318
Mother!

01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:12.447
The ship will
automatically destruct...

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:16.200
In t-minus five minutes.

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:21.706

You bitch!

01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:39.807
Goddamn it!

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:12.900
Jonesy.

01:41:58.195 --> 01:42:03.075
You now have one minute
to abandon ship.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:06.829
The ship will
automatically destruct...

01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:10.041

you son of a bitch.

01:44:50.868 --> 01:44:52.828
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:44:52.912 --> 01:44:55.289
It's all right.

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:06.383
Shh, shh, shh.

01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:11.263
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right.

01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:22.483
All right.
It's nice to see you too.

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:24.485
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:26.570
It's okay.

01:49:57.132 --> 01:49:58.926

ash and captain dallas—
Are dead.

Cargo and ship destroyed.

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:06.321
I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.

01:53:06.405 --> 01:53:10.158
With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.

01:53:10.242 --> 01:53:14.871
This is Ripley,
last survivor of the nostromo,

01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:17.874
signing off.

01:53:24.756 --> 01:53:26.591
Come on, cat.
