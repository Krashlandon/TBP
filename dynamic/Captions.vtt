No, you can't do that.
Can't do that!

[Elisabeth] Yes, I can.

Ajay, look, there's no time.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.958
The Dillingers transported me
inside their server

01:22:03.041 --> 01:22:04.625
by reversing the direction
of a particle laser.

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:07.041
- Not this one. Theirs.
- That's impossible.

No. A scary lady did it, man.
She threw me... It was wild.

01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:12.750
I saw a complex world

01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:15.041
where packets of energy
move as vehicles

I met the most advanced AI
known to mankind.

His name is Ares.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.541
Like the god of war, but he's
actually a super nice guy.

01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:28.750
- Sorry.
- Right now,

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:31.291
Ares is inside
Flynn's original server.

01:22:31.375 --> 01:22:32.875
He's looking
for the Permanence Code.

01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.333
I have to bring him back here,

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.458
and I'm not going to be able
to do that

01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:38.291
until we fix this laser.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.916
I don't understand.
Are you alive?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.500
I exist in this moment
because you do.

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:49.458
A reflection of your presence.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:52.708
What's your story?

01:22:52.791 --> 01:22:56.416
I'm Ares, Master Control of
the Dillinger Security Grid.

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.250

01:22:58.833 --> 01:23:00.458
Hmm.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:03.125
Well, we both know
you can't get here from there.

You can say that again.

What are you looking for?

01:23:29.416 --> 01:23:30.416
Permanence.

01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:35.833
The Permanence Code,
to be exact.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:38.375
Strange things have
been happening.

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:42.166
I questioned my directive.
I disobeyed my directive.

What makes you think
I should help you?

01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:54.083
No, it's not about me.

01:23:55.166 --> 01:23:56.708
Not anymore.

01:23:56.791 --> 01:24:00.208
I have a friend in danger,

Fascinating.

Hey, Ajay, can you send

01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:13.541
[Ajay] Sure, yeah.

- Not now, Seth.

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:23.125
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:25.708
Because that looks like
an actual Recognizer

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:26.916

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:35.041
It's Athena.

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:36.875
She's back.

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.833
As long as the Dillinger
Network is online,

01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:41.041
she'll keep coming.

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:44.291
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:49.208
The laser. Athena's laser!

01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:52.625
The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:54.166
so let's use
what's left of the laser

01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:56.750
to ping the network
and trace a path home.

01:24:56.833 --> 01:24:58.208
Once you have a connection,

01:24:58.291 --> 01:25:00.250
then you can nuke
the whole Dillinger Grid.

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:03.041
And that's the only way
to stop her for good.

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:04.708
Eve, what are you
talking about?

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:05.750

- [Ajay] Wait, what?

01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:13.583
I'll keep her away
for as long as I can.

01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:15.666
- What?
- I'm gonna buy you some time.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:17.458

something wrong with me.

[Flynn] Or maybe there's
something right with you.

Well, maybe you're
just learning.

That's what we all
ought to be doing.

<i>In the 1980s,</i>

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:56.625
<i>visionary Kevin Flynn imagined</i>
<i>a future beyond gaming,</i>

01:46:56.708 --> 01:47:00.083
<i>a bold leap</i>
<i>into new digital frontiers.</i>

01:47:00.166 --> 01:47:02.416
<i>Today, that vision</i>
<i>is a reality.</i>

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:07.916
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:10.875
Postcard?
Who sends a postcard?

01:47:10.958 --> 01:47:12.750
Don't know. Didn't read it.

01:47:17.583 --> 01:47:18.750
[Ares] <i>Dear Eve,</i>

01:47:19.791 --> 01:47:21.000
<i>since I last saw you,</i>

01:47:21.083 --> 01:47:24.708
<i>I've been living</i>
<i>what they call "off-grid."</i>

01:47:25.416 --> 01:47:26.791
<i>Pun intended.</i>

01:47:27.875 --> 01:47:31.166
<i>In my travels,</i>
<i>I've seen incredible things.</i>

01:47:32.291 --> 01:47:33.791
<i>Despite its wonder and beauty,</i>

01:47:33.875 --> 01:47:36.916
<i>I've come to realize</i>
<i>that life is...</i>

01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:39.750
<i>Well, it's hard</i>
<i>to put in a nutshell.</i>

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.666
<i>Some days,</i>
<i>I find myself wondering</i>

01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:44.250
<i>where we'll be</i>
<i>a hundred years from now...</i>

01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:47.958
<i>...and how others like me</i>
<i>might fit into that future.</i>

01:47:49.958 --> 01:47:53.375
<i>I feel like I might not be</i>
<i>alone with these questions.</i>

01:47:54.875 --> 01:47:55.875
<i>For now,</i>

01:47:55.958 --> 01:47:58.250
<i>I don't think the world</i>
<i>is quite ready to meet me,</i>

01:47:59.333 --> 01:48:01.583
<i>but I am meeting the world.</i>

01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:05.833
<i>And so, when that</i>
<i>introduction finally comes,</i>

01:48:07.333 --> 01:48:09.125
<i>as a good friend of mine</i>
<i>once said,</i>

01:48:09.208 --> 01:48:11.208
<i>"Maybe what emerges</i>
<i>from the unknown</i>

01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:13.958
<i>won't be so scary after all."</i>

01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:18.833
<i>Until we meet again,</i>

01:48:19.333 --> 01:48:21.500
<i>your friend, Ares.</i>

01:48:21.583 --> 01:48:22.666
