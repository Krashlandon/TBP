WEBVTT

00:04:56.464 --> 00:04:59.550
Hurry up. Come on.
This way.

00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:08.518
Hurry UP-

00:05:21.072 --> 00:05:23.783
This will do. Now which one
are you gonna have?

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:25.868
- I'll have...
- No, that's mine.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.787
Alley-COP!

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.492
How far are the trees, Danny?

00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:10.371
Over 200 feet.

00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:12.248
I'd say 300.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.625
Long ways to digging.

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.044
We'll get Cavendish
to make a survey.

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.714
I wish Big X were here.

00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:21.924
Willie, you think X got away?

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:23.968
No, he'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.761
Gestapo, you think?

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.805
Either that or he's dead.

00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:45.990
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes?

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.575
I am Strachwitz.

00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:50.244
Will you accompany me, please?

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:52.455
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:07.261
Group Commander Ramsey.

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:10.097
Good morning, Group Captain.

00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:14.101
I am Captain Posen,
Von Luger's adjutant.

00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:17.521
As senior British officer,
you are to be liaison...

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:20.900
between the prisoners
and the colonel.

00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:23.194
We wish to make clear to you
certain matters of...

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.530
The word is "policy"?

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:28.741
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:45.675
Group Commander Ramsey.

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:49.220
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.

00:07:58.354 --> 00:08:01.732
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years...

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:05.027
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time...

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:09.240
energy, manpower and equipment hunting
down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:13.577
At least it's rather nice to know
you're wanted, isn't it?

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.747
For us it's not a matter for levity.

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.583
There will be no escapes
from this camp.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:23.754
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:26.257
If they can't, it is their sworn duty
to cause the enemy...

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:29.260
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them...

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:33.431
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:35.433
Yes, I know.

00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:39.186
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.314
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:45.443
Caught, escaped, recaptured,
escaped, recaptured.

00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:48.863
Archibald "Archie" Ives.

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.406
Eleven escape attempts.

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:52.950
Even tried to jump out of the truck
coming here.

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:56.120
Dickes, William.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:59.498
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:01.709
Flight Lieutenant Willinski,
four escapes.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:04.837
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, an American, five.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.505
Haynes, four.
Sedgwick, seven.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.883
The list is almost endless.

00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:12.845
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.181
Group Captain,
this is close to insanity.

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:18.267
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.479
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:30.404
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:35.284
This is a new camp.

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:38.871
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:42.166
It is organized to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:46.754
And in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer...

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:51.175
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task...

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.260
by the Luftwaffe High Command.

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:59.558
We have, in effect, put all
our rotten eggs in one basket...

00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:02.895
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:05.147
Very wise.

00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:11.195
You will not be denied
the use of facilities.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.324
Sports, the library...

00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:17.576
the recreation hall...

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.871
and for gardening,
we will give you tools.

00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:23.666
We trust you to use them
for gardening.

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.752
Devote your energies
to these things.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.380
Give up your hopeless attempts
to escape...

00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:33.676
and, with intelligent cooperation...

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.845
we may all sit out the war...

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:40.015
as comfortably as possible.

00:10:57.575 --> 00:11:00.911
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:04.290
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:06.792
- You are American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:09.795
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.881
Why fight for England,
your enemy?

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:13.924
"Enemy"?
What are you talking about?

00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:16.760
In 1812,
they burned your capitol.

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.764
- That's propaganda.
- It's in the history books.

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:20.764
- It's pure propaganda.
- I read it.

00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:24.101
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:25.769
Yeah, no tools.

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:33.527
Hey, Virgil.

00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:36.113
Did you see the cooler?

00:11:36.197 --> 00:11:38.282
Boy, is it ever a big one.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.743
I think they expect
a lot of business.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:44.079
Those two guys who were with us
in the old camp in hut 14...

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:45.581
I can't find them.

00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:48.626
- You think the goons left them behind?
- I guess.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.170
What were their names?
Jackson and...

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.548
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:57.384
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see ya later.

00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:23.911
Danny, who are they?

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:27.873
Russian prisoners.
They cut down trees.

00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:31.168
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.172
Willie, cigarettes.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:59.321
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a show for the goons?

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:01.782
Sure, mate.
What will it be? An all-out go?

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.450
- Mad prisoner?
- Choir practice.

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:06.203
- Knuckles, eh'?
- Knuckles would be fine.

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.205
Give him the coat.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.500
What are you doing
with my coat, mate?

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:12.918
It's mine!

00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:15.045
Are you pushing me,
you common Canadian?

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:17.172
It's mine,
you illiterate Aussie...

00:13:43.032 --> 00:13:45.534
I'll send you back
to the Commonwealth!

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.663
Stop it!
Stop this nonsense!

00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:51.540
It's all right, mate.

00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:53.584
We're just having
a friendly little argument.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.337
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.339
- Get back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:58.422 --> 00:13:59.965
You too!

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.886
Get away!
Get back in your huts!

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.765
Go on!

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:40.964
Hey, Hilts!

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.801
Looks like there's
only one other American.

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.470
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.931
You got something going already?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:51.100
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.395
- Yeah.
- Got a blind spot in the middle.

00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:55.813
A blind spot?

00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.776
Guy could stand at that wire and not
be seen by that tower or that tower.

00:14:58.816 --> 00:15:01.860
The one on the end is too far. They'd
never see me, especially at night.

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:03.987
- You're crazy.
- You think so?

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.906
Let's find out.
Right now.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:25.717
Now, the next step's
a little tricky.

00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:28.720
- You're not going out there?
- While they're looking I'm not.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.017
I think I'll take a little walk.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.814
March!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.396
- Danny, do you speak Russian?
- A little, but only one sentence.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.731
Let me have it.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.074
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.703
"Love you."
What bloody good is that?

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:37.080
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:55.641
Halt!

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.233
Out. Out!

00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.110
Your friend?

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.783
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.409
Get out, Sedgwick.

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.532
Hold it!

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.289
- Your name?
- Ives.

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:06.753
Oh, yes.
Archibald Ives. Scot.

00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:09.339
The photograph
doesn't do justice.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.426
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:40.537
I will not take action
against you now.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:44.041
This is the first day here,
and there has been much stupidity and...

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:48.003
carelessness on both sides.

00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:07.397
Hey! Get out!

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.611
Don't shoot!

00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:18.116
You fool!
You cross the wire of death!

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.911
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:25.248
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it!
You know that!

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.919
Yeah, but my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.921
You first ask permission.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.635
- Get my baseball!
- Stop this nonsense! Get over the wire!

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:39.680
- Immediately!
- You, stay there!

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.015
Out of the way.

00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:49.022
What were you doing over here?

00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:51.191
Like I told Max,
I was trying to get my...

00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:07.040
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Like I told Max...

00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:10.210
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire because I wanna get out.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.678
You speak German?

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:22.806
Wire cutters.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:30.147
I have had the pleasure of knowing
many British officers in this war...

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.566
and I flatter myself that
we understand one another.

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.951
You are the first American officer
I've met. Hilts, isn't it?

00:20:42.993 --> 00:20:44.870
Captain Hilts, actually.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.955
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

00:20:46.997 --> 00:20:48.373
Tunnel man. Engineer.

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:50.584
Flier.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.379
I suppose what's called
in the American army, a "hotshot pilot."

00:20:54.463 --> 00:20:57.174
Unfortunately,
you got shot down anyway.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.010
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.179
You speak for yourself, Colonel.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.101
You have other plans?

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:10.228
I haven't seen Berlin
from the ground or air.

00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:12.689
I plan on doing both
before the war is over.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.026
Are all American officers
so ill-mannered?

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.779
About 99%.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:22.949
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will learn some.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.035
Ten days' isolation, Hilts.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.872
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.

00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:30.499
Right.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.127
You'll still be here
when I get out'?

00:21:35.504 --> 00:21:37.464
Cooler.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.932
- Name?
- Ives.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.060
Flying Officer Ives.

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:51.812
Cooler, twenty days.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.943
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:41.671
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:43.673
I was in college.

00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:48.720
Say, Ives.
How many escapes have you tried?

00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:51.556
Four over, seven under.

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:56.937
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I'm not.

00:23:58.355 --> 00:23:59.856
How tall are you?

00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:03.026
Five-feet-four. Why?

00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:05.779
Just wondering.

00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:10.951
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:13.912
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:15.580
Bicycles?

00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:20.210
Motorcycles.
You know, flat tracks, county fairs.

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:22.796
Picked up a buck here and there.
Helped pay my tuition.

00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:24.881
I did a wee bit racing myself.

00:24:24.923 --> 00:24:27.425
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:31.054
No, horse racing.
Jockey.

00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:34.391
Jockey.

00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:39.145
Jockey?

00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:44.985
Hilts?

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.904
Are you there, Hilts?

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:54.035
- I'm here.
- Do you have jockeys in the States?

00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:58.498
- Sure.
- They were the days.

00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:03.003
Saturday nights in towns
like Mussoboro and Hamilton.

00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:05.964
You could pay off the "birds."

00:25:06.047 --> 00:25:07.966
You know, "birds."

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:10.260
Girls, man.

00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:13.263
You know of them in the States?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.227
Are you there, Hilts?

00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:26.943
What?

00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:29.988
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we've got here in the compound?

00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:31.614
Aye.

00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:34.826
How many feet you think you can
get through in, say, eight hours?

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:37.370
I could cut through this stuff here...

00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:39.456
like the bit on an end of an auger.

00:25:39.497 --> 00:25:41.499
But you know, it's not the digging.

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.334
It's the shoring up with wood...

00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:45.128
and getting the dirt out.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.963
That's what you have to worry about.

00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:49.966
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

00:25:50.008 --> 00:25:52.343
How you going to get the dirt out?

00:25:52.427 --> 00:25:55.138
What do they call a mole
in Scotland?

00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.473
A mole.

00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:58.600
Aye.

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:03.354
Well, what do you think, Navy?

00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:07.150
I must say, it's an interesting
first 20 minutes.

00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:09.652
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

00:26:09.694 --> 00:26:13.281
You know what this is?
This is only the first day.

00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:36.638
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:39.682
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:54.823
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:07.752
I suggest this prisoner Bartlett
to be kept...

00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:10.255
under the strictest security
confinement permanently.

00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:14.175
Make a note
of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:17.387
We have reason to believe
that this prisoner...

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.140
is the leader of numerous
criminal escape attempts.

00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:25.895
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care...

00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:29.357
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:31.901
If he once more
falls into our hands...

00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:33.820
he will not be so lucky.

00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:35.822
Air Force officer prisoners...

00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:39.242
are the responsibility
<i>of</i> the Luftwaffe, not the S.S.!

00:27:42.078 --> 00:27:44.038
Or the Gestapo.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.708
At present, yes.

00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:49.210
That is why he's returned,
for the moment...

00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:50.628
to your care.

00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:51.754
Of course...

00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:53.798
<i>if</i> the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task...

00:27:53.882 --> 00:27:56.593
the prisoner will find themselves
totally in our charge.

00:27:56.676 --> 00:27:59.721
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

00:28:05.018 --> 00:28:07.478
Squadron Leader Bartlett.

00:28:07.562 --> 00:28:12.442
If you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:13.086
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:15.588
- They dumped you in here too.
- Yes. What's this one like?

00:29:15.672 --> 00:29:17.340
Well, it's new.

00:29:18.508 --> 00:29:21.469
Here.
Let's find you a bed.

00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:22.929
Thanks.

00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:41.114
Come in.

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:45.285
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:48.621
I'll put your bag in your room.

00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:50.039
Thanks, Eric.

00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:53.042
- How are you?
- As well as could be expected.

00:29:53.126 --> 00:29:56.587
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome
committee for you, but that's for later.

00:29:56.671 --> 00:29:58.840
Yes, I saw Willie and Willinski
with Mac.

00:29:58.881 --> 00:30:01.301
Lot of old friends here.

00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:04.220
- How long have you been here?
- Arrived today.

00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:06.973
New camp, expert guards.
The elite.

00:30:08.057 --> 00:30:09.976
You met the commandant?

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.979
Yes, I did.

00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:15.982
What were the Gestapo
and the S.S. doing with you?

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:18.901
They wanted to find out
who had helped me to the border.

00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:21.279
Who else is here?
Have we got Cavendish?

00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:24.324
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

00:30:24.407 --> 00:30:26.909
- Blythe?
- Yes.

00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:29.203
Almost the whole X organization.

00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:30.747
Almost.

00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:34.459
They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:36.210
As Von Luger put it...

00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:39.088
"all the rotten eggs
in one basket."

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.759
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:46.554
No, but there's an American.
Hendley.

00:30:47.847 --> 00:30:50.141
Is he a scrounger?
Blackmailer?

00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:51.976
MacDonald says he's the best.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.895
Good.

00:30:55.063 --> 00:30:58.149
Last of the tea until the Red Cross
gets through again.

00:30:58.232 --> 00:30:59.817
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:07.867
Did the Gestapo
give you a rough time?

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:11.871
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:14.832
Personal revenge...

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.543
must be kept out
of what we have to do here.

00:31:17.627 --> 00:31:19.629
Too many lives are at stake.

00:31:22.423 --> 00:31:25.802
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.888
You appointed me Big X.

00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:31.307
It's my duty to harass,
confound and confuse the enemy...

00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:33.142
to the best of my ability.

00:31:33.184 --> 00:31:36.479
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:41.317
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs...

00:31:41.401 --> 00:31:44.320
that thousands of troops
that could be employed at the front...

00:31:44.404 --> 00:31:46.322
will be tied up here
looking after us.

00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:47.782
How?

00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:49.826
By putting more men
out of this...

00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:53.871
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:55.873
Not blitzing out two or three
or a dozen...

00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:58.918
but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:01.421
- Do you think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

00:32:01.504 --> 00:32:04.924
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany in this camp.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.095
Have you thought of
what it might cost?

00:32:11.347 --> 00:32:15.685
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit...

00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:17.687
knuckle under and crawl.

00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:19.647
You don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

00:32:21.441 --> 00:32:24.318
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.321
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be...

00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.616
the high command have still left us
in the hands <i>of</i> the Luftwaffe...

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.869
<i>not the Gestapo and the 8.3.</i>

00:32:34.912 --> 00:32:38.583
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command and the Luftwaffe...

00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.585
<i>and then the 8.8. and the Gestapo.</i>

00:32:40.668 --> 00:32:43.212
To me, they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:46.632
There's only one way
to put it, sir.

00:32:46.716 --> 00:32:50.303
They are the common enemies
of everyone who believes in freedom.

00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:53.473
If the high command didn't approve of
Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:55.600
I have no argument
with you, Roger.

00:32:56.434 --> 00:32:57.894
As senior officer...

00:32:57.935 --> 00:33:00.396
I'm merely pointing out
a pertinent fact.

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:06.319
When are you calling
a meeting, X?

00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:15.828
Tonight.

00:33:27.632 --> 00:33:29.675
Gentlemen,
no doubt you've heard...

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:33.721
the immortal words
of our new commandant.

00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:36.265
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape...

00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:38.976
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible.”

00:33:41.229 --> 00:33:44.273
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:47.693
We're gonna devote our energies
to sports and gardening.

00:33:47.777 --> 00:33:50.571
All the cultural pursuits,
as far as they're concerned.

00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:52.990
In fact, we're gonna put
the goons to sleep.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.203
Meanwhile, we dig.

00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:01.874
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound...

00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:05.211
shows us that huts 104 and 105
are closest to the woods.

00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:08.464
The first tunnel goes out
from 105 directly east...

00:34:08.548 --> 00:34:11.467
under the cooler and the wire.

00:34:11.551 --> 00:34:13.135
That's over 300 feet.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.305
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

00:34:16.347 --> 00:34:18.432
I make it just over 335 feet.

00:34:18.474 --> 00:34:20.977
Let me know when you've got
an exact one. Willie.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.146
This time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

00:34:24.188 --> 00:34:26.148
That'll rule out
sound detection or probing.

00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:30.611
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

00:34:30.653 --> 00:34:31.654
I did.

00:34:32.572 --> 00:34:34.198
There'll be three.

00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.620
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

00:34:39.662 --> 00:34:44.208
Dick goes north from the kitchen,
and Harry goes parallel to Tom from 105.

00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:49.589
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:52.133
How many men
do you plan to take out?

00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:54.802
250.

00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.347
There'll be no half measures
this time, gentlemen.

00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:01.017
There'll be identification papers
and documents for everyone.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.228
Griff, we'll need outfits
for the lot.

00:35:04.312 --> 00:35:06.939
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

00:35:07.023 --> 00:35:08.899
Yes, but, uh..

00:35:10.443 --> 00:35:12.236
Okay, Roger.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.990
Mac, maps, blankets,
rations, compasses...

00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:18.451
for all the walkers
and timetables for every train.

00:35:18.534 --> 00:35:19.869
Right, Roger.

00:35:25.207 --> 00:35:26.792
Sorry I'm late, Roger.

00:35:26.876 --> 00:35:29.587
All right, Collin, sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

00:35:31.714 --> 00:35:33.674
Splendid.

00:35:33.716 --> 00:35:36.010
Willie, you and Danny
will be tunnel kings.

00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:39.722
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.
We'll work out their location tomorrow.

00:35:39.764 --> 00:35:43.059
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

00:35:43.142 --> 00:35:47.980
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac will take care of intelligence.

00:35:48.064 --> 00:35:50.650
Hendley? We haven't met.

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:53.527
- Scrounger?
- Right.

00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:56.113
Dennis, maps and surveys.

00:35:56.197 --> 00:35:58.407
Collin, you'll take
your usual job.

00:35:58.491 --> 00:36:00.868
Eric, how are you
gonna get rid of this dirt?

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.495
The usual places.

00:36:03.454 --> 00:36:05.873
Hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:09.335
Who's gonna handle security
for all this?

00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:11.212
You are.

00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:14.590
I want a system of stooges covering
this compound from front to back...

00:36:14.632 --> 00:36:17.551
checking every goon in and out.

00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:20.221
I want a signal system so perfect...

00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:23.265
that if a fellow gets near
a hut in which we're working...

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:25.351
we can shut down without a sign.

00:36:29.939 --> 00:36:31.941
There's no point
in discussing more now.

00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:35.569
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit to pound out the details.

00:36:38.948 --> 00:36:41.033
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:43.119
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:11.981
Oh, hello.
My name's Blythe.

00:37:14.442 --> 00:37:15.484
Hendley.

00:37:19.822 --> 00:37:21.240
For birds.

00:37:21.323 --> 00:37:23.868
- I've done a little hunting myself.
- Not hunting.

00:37:23.951 --> 00:37:25.202
Watching.

00:37:28.122 --> 00:37:29.540
Bird-watcher?

00:37:29.623 --> 00:37:33.335
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

00:37:36.005 --> 00:37:38.382
I suppose you have bird-watchers
in the States.

00:37:38.466 --> 00:37:40.926
Yes, we have some.

00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:43.596
Tea?

00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:47.224
I only drank tea once,
in a hospital.

00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:50.019
Where's your kit?

00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:54.398
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

00:37:55.858 --> 00:37:59.361
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.534
Such as.

00:38:05.618 --> 00:38:07.369
You're the scrounger.

00:38:07.453 --> 00:38:09.330
Yes, that's right.

00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:11.081
I'll need a camera.

00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:15.836
- What kind?
- A good one.

00:38:15.878 --> 00:38:18.172
A 35-millimeter f2.8...

00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:21.175
with a focal plane shutter
should do all right.

00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:24.637
All right.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.263
And film, of course.

00:38:26.347 --> 00:38:28.265
Oh, of course.

00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:33.103
Oh, Hendley, I need a pick.
Big heavy one.

00:38:33.187 --> 00:38:35.189
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.446
Afraid this tea's pathetic.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.908
Must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:49.453
It's not that I mind so much.

00:38:49.537 --> 00:38:52.164
Tea without milk
is so uncivilized.

00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:55.793
Yeah. I'll get our wood.

00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:06.095
Close up.

00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:15.729
Close up.

00:39:19.775 --> 00:39:21.068
Close up.

00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:50.556
Splendid.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.362
Blythe, what are you doing here?

00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:11.118
I'm in photographic aerial
reconnaissance interpretation.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.039
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:18.667
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down.

00:40:18.709 --> 00:40:20.127
Terrifying.

00:40:20.169 --> 00:40:22.838
No, I mean, what do you do here?

00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:25.132
Here'?

00:40:27.343 --> 00:40:28.844
I'm the forger.

00:40:49.198 --> 00:40:52.701
The forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut. Sedgwick?

00:40:52.743 --> 00:40:55.120
- I'm in 110.
- Griffith?

00:40:55.204 --> 00:40:57.373
I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

00:40:57.414 --> 00:40:59.708
109? Right.

00:40:59.792 --> 00:41:02.670
I'll work in 107. For now,
Danny and Willie and their team...

00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:04.254
will be in 104.

00:41:04.338 --> 00:41:08.550
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without shoring up.

00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:11.887
We will need timber for the shaft
and the entrance chambers.

00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:14.431
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:18.519
We can tear up 15 and move men between
huts so the goons won't miss them.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.938
The rest will come
from the strips off the wall.

00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:23.065
- Is Hendley handling this himself?
- Not yet.

00:41:23.107 --> 00:41:26.193
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

00:41:45.629 --> 00:41:48.424
What is going on here?
Turn the water off!

00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:50.134
Get your hand away!

00:41:58.183 --> 00:41:59.727
Stop this nonsense!

00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:05.733
Get away here!
Turn the water off!

00:42:05.774 --> 00:42:07.109
Somewhere!

00:42:47.316 --> 00:42:50.319
In the stove,
we keep fire burning always.

00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:52.654
This way the goons
will not feel like moving it.

00:42:52.738 --> 00:42:54.198
Good.

00:42:55.324 --> 00:42:57.785
Two tiles are chipped.
We need new ones.

00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:00.954
There are some in 113's washroom.
Should match perfectly.

00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:02.873
Good.

00:43:11.006 --> 00:43:13.092
It's going to be
a bit tricky, Danny.

00:43:15.094 --> 00:43:17.304
Not when you're organized, Mac.

00:43:22.017 --> 00:43:24.019
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

00:43:24.103 --> 00:43:27.189
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

00:43:34.113 --> 00:43:35.656
Good luck to us, Danny.

00:43:54.716 --> 00:43:56.718
Why 17?

00:43:56.802 --> 00:43:59.388
This is the 17th tunnel
Danny's started.

00:44:48.854 --> 00:44:50.189
It's good.

00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:01.700
It's very good.

00:45:01.783 --> 00:45:03.118
Haynes.

00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.990
Get out! Get out!

00:45:58.674 --> 00:46:00.509
Out. Out here.

00:46:05.264 --> 00:46:07.432
You are not in your hut.

00:46:07.516 --> 00:46:10.143
- What are you doing here?
- Mopping up.

00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:17.484
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:24.533
I'm watchin' him.
I'm a lifeguard.

00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:31.373
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:22.924
No. I vote no.

00:47:23.008 --> 00:47:26.553
We've put the goons to sleep like
you said, but one thing like this...

00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:28.597
and we're up the creek
without a paddle.

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:32.601
Sit down, won't you?

00:47:32.642 --> 00:47:33.935
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:36.355
Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

00:47:36.438 --> 00:47:38.523
- Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
- Hi.

00:47:39.441 --> 00:47:42.569
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz out.

00:47:42.611 --> 00:47:44.780
Where'd you hear that, sir?

00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:47.741
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

00:47:49.618 --> 00:47:51.787
We thought, perhaps,
we might talk it over.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.872
Why? It's only a two-man job.

00:47:53.955 --> 00:47:55.248
Everybody in the camp...

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.085
is supposed to clear
all escape attempts in advance...

00:47:58.126 --> 00:47:59.586
with Bartlett.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.964
We don't necessarily
want to interfere.

00:48:03.048 --> 00:48:04.132
It's just that...

00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:08.428
What sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.349
We sneak out at night to a blind spot
I found near the wire.

00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:14.351
Then we dig straight down
three feet...

00:48:14.434 --> 00:48:17.938
take the dirt, spread it on top so it
won't make a pile and then straight out.

00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:20.524
Ives is a tunnel man,
so he digs in front...

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:23.527
pushes the dirt behind him,
and I stash it behind me.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.530
Then we burrow through the dirt
like a couple of moles.

00:48:26.613 --> 00:48:29.074
By dawn, we're under the wire,
into the woods...

00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:31.326
and gone.

00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:43.964
When do you intend to try this?

00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:46.425
- When do you intend to try it?
- Tonight.

00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:52.013
This may not be quite the right time
for this sort of thing.

00:48:52.097 --> 00:48:55.517
Look, sir. I've been in the bank
nearly three years now.

00:48:55.559 --> 00:48:57.936
Bloody close
to being wire-happy.

00:48:58.019 --> 00:49:00.105
It's a blitz out for me
or forget it.

00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:04.025
It'll work.
I know it will.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.535
Good luck.

00:49:13.618 --> 00:49:15.120
Thank you.

00:49:17.497 --> 00:49:19.916
Hilts, how do you breathe?

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.043
We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:24.880
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along. Good night, sir.

00:49:32.262 --> 00:49:35.307
Why didn't anybody
think of that before?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.893
It's so stupid
it's positively brilliant!

00:49:38.977 --> 00:49:42.063
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

00:49:42.147 --> 00:49:44.483
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

00:49:44.566 --> 00:49:46.651
If we stop all the breakouts...

00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:50.113
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

00:49:50.197 --> 00:49:51.656
I hope it works.

00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:55.744
If it doesn't, they will be
in the cooler for a long time.

00:50:41.957 --> 00:50:45.001
- Good, eh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

00:50:51.258 --> 00:50:53.301
This is the dirt
from the compound.

00:50:53.385 --> 00:50:55.428
This is from the tunnel.

00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:04.479
Wherever we put it, they're going
to spot it a mile away.

00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:07.482
Maybe we can put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

00:51:07.524 --> 00:51:09.568
No, it's the first place
the ferrets would look.

00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:11.629
I saw one measuring the height
under a hut yesterday.

00:51:11.653 --> 00:51:13.613
Maybe we could dry it up
the same color.

00:51:13.655 --> 00:51:17.993
- We'll have 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

00:51:18.034 --> 00:51:20.495
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

00:51:22.372 --> 00:51:24.541
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

00:51:26.084 --> 00:51:28.670
We can't destroy the dirt.
We can't eat it.

00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:32.841
The only thing left to do
is camouflage it.

00:51:32.924 --> 00:51:34.968
That's as far
as my thinking takes me.

00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:39.264
Didn't they teach you promptness
in the R.N.?

00:51:39.347 --> 00:51:42.267
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.688
The problem is somehow to get rid
of this tunnel dirt over the compound.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.189
Well, of course.

00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:51.026
Would you mind?

00:52:01.328 --> 00:52:02.746
Now...

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.293
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

00:52:08.376 --> 00:52:12.088
Then, wearing them
inside your trousers...

00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:15.592
you wander out
into the compound, where...

00:52:15.675 --> 00:52:18.053
you pull these strings
in your pockets.

00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:21.473
Out come the pins.

00:52:24.434 --> 00:52:25.977
Eric, it's good.

00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:28.647
All you have to do is kick it in.

00:52:29.564 --> 00:52:32.359
Unless you're a complete fool,
the ferrets will never see a thing.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.362
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger'?

00:52:35.403 --> 00:52:38.323
- We'll try it tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:44.287
Mac, this is what we'll do.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.428
Present from Tom, sir.

00:53:00.512 --> 00:53:02.055
Thank you, Nimmo.

00:53:10.689 --> 00:53:13.983
- Nice garden you got, sir.
- Yes, carry on.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.684
All right, let's look sharp!

00:53:54.774 --> 00:53:56.109
That looks sharp.

00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.198
Sir.

00:54:05.535 --> 00:54:09.330
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

00:54:25.138 --> 00:54:27.557
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.811
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

00:54:31.853 --> 00:54:33.354
We'll manage, sir.

00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:47.202
I must say I'm surprised at the extent
of this activity, Group Captain.

00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:49.537
Pleased, of course,
but surprised.

00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:50.914
Surprised, Colonel?

00:54:51.873 --> 00:54:56.085
Fliers are gentlemen,
not peasants to dig in the earth.

00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:57.545
So I am surprised.

00:54:57.587 --> 00:55:00.131
The English have always been
very keen on gardening.

00:55:00.215 --> 00:55:03.760
Yes, but flowers.
Is this not so?

00:55:04.677 --> 00:55:06.930
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

00:55:09.224 --> 00:55:10.683
Good point.

00:55:28.076 --> 00:55:31.287
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:34.749
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so?

00:55:34.791 --> 00:55:37.210
We'll find out soon enough.

00:55:48.972 --> 00:55:51.099
- Morning, Bob.
- Sandy.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.767
Here we are.

00:55:52.851 --> 00:55:54.519
Now, let's see.

00:55:54.602 --> 00:55:57.063
Biscuits, two packets.

00:55:57.105 --> 00:55:59.482
Coffee, two tins.

00:55:59.566 --> 00:56:01.860
Bovarro, one jar.

00:56:01.943 --> 00:56:04.612
Cigarettes, six packets.

00:56:04.696 --> 00:56:06.531
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.

00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:09.075
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

00:56:09.117 --> 00:56:11.202
And marmalade, mine.

00:56:11.286 --> 00:56:15.874
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.709
Oh, yes.

00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:21.546
And Dutch chocolate, two bars.

00:56:21.629 --> 00:56:24.299
That cleans out the gift boot
for the entire organization.

00:56:24.382 --> 00:56:28.219
Now, the first thing we need
is a new form of travel permit.

00:56:28.303 --> 00:56:31.347
Forgers don't know what it looks like,
and they can't move without it.

00:56:31.431 --> 00:56:34.183
- I'll see what I can do.
- And any other...

00:56:34.267 --> 00:56:38.521
identity cards, personal papers,
documents you can put your hands on.

00:56:38.605 --> 00:56:39.856
Put them to work.

00:56:39.939 --> 00:56:41.941
- Right.
- Good luck.

00:56:51.034 --> 00:56:55.288
<i>O come, all ye faithful</i>

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:58.666
<i>Joyful and triumphant</i>

00:56:58.708 --> 00:57:00.585
<i>O come ye</i>

00:57:00.668 --> 00:57:06.215
<i>O come ye to Bethlehem</i>

00:57:06.299 --> 00:57:10.011
<i>Come and behold Him</i>

00:57:10.053 --> 00:57:13.348
<i>Born the king of angels</i>

00:57:13.389 --> 00:57:17.060
<i>O come let us adore Him</i>

00:57:25.234 --> 00:57:27.987
Louie, where the hell
is the air pump?

00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:29.989
Patience is a virtue.

00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:33.868
I know, dear boy, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open...

00:57:33.952 --> 00:57:36.537
and this is holding us up
very badly.

00:57:38.498 --> 00:57:40.541
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:43.503
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

00:57:43.544 --> 00:57:46.881
- When will they be finished?
- One or two days.

00:57:46.923 --> 00:57:50.426
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:54.222
- Will it give us enough air?
- It's as much as you'll need.

00:57:56.015 --> 00:57:57.266
ExceHenL

00:57:58.768 --> 00:58:00.395
Have it in by tomorrow night.

00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:13.950
Got a light?

00:58:17.912 --> 00:58:19.580
Thanks.

00:58:19.664 --> 00:58:22.083
- That's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:32.844
I'm sorry.
Would you like one?

00:58:34.762 --> 00:58:38.182
I'll smoke it later
when I'm off duty. Thank you.

00:58:38.266 --> 00:58:41.185
You probably have a couple
of roommates, huh?

00:58:42.562 --> 00:58:45.356
- Beautiful day.
- Yes.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.734
But I think it might rain later.

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:51.904
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:53.906
Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.”

00:58:53.948 --> 00:58:56.451
There was a red sky last night.

00:58:56.492 --> 00:58:58.453
I never heard that before.

00:58:58.536 --> 00:59:00.913
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

00:59:00.955 --> 00:59:03.124
You were a Boy Scout?
So was I.

00:59:03.207 --> 00:59:05.626
- Really?
- I had 19 merit badges.

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:07.545
I had 20.

00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:11.466
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting...

00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:14.844
and sent me into
the Hitler Youth instead.

00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:22.393
Hey, Werner, you think you'll
stay in the army after the war?

00:59:22.477 --> 00:59:25.521
Oh, no.
I'm not a well man.

00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:28.357
- My teeth.
- Your teeth?

00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:32.570
I could tell you stories about my teeth
that would make your hair stand on end.

00:59:32.653 --> 00:59:34.906
Our dentist here is a butcher.

00:59:36.074 --> 00:59:37.992
But don't tell anyone I said so.

00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:42.246
It's a soldier's right to complain.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.249
Maybe in your army, but here...

00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:49.754
one little criticism and...
to the Russian front.

00:59:49.837 --> 00:59:51.923
Is that so?

00:59:52.006 --> 00:59:53.382
Terrible.

00:59:54.217 --> 00:59:56.177
That's terrible.

01:00:01.224 --> 01:00:02.225
Werner?

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:08.648
Let's go to my room
where we can talk more comfortably.

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:12.193
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:16.697
I was just gonna
make some coffee.

01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:21.035
Some real coffee.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:52.608
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.610
Where is it?

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.575
Marmalade?

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:03.744
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:09.375
Chocolate.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.878
Oh, yeah, here.
Take one.

01:01:18.217 --> 01:01:20.011
Von Luger's butter!

01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:22.346
Yeah. Keep it.

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:25.224
Nein! I must go.

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:27.727
You can keep it.
We're friends.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:30.980
With you in the cooler, will we still
be friends? I must report this.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:33.149
I don't understand.
Report what?

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:36.527
That you and I were
chatting in my room?

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:39.488
- I must go.
- It's okay. Keep it.

01:01:39.572 --> 01:01:43.075
I'll never be able to eat it.
I've got all I could eat.

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:46.370
I'm sorry.
All right, forget it.

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:22.990
And that, I'm sure you'll remember,
is the voice of the Nellie warbler.

01:02:23.074 --> 01:02:26.244
Now let's turn our attention
to this gentleman, the masked shrike...

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.579
Lanius nubicas,
the butcher bird.

01:02:28.663 --> 01:02:32.708
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thornbushes.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.502
Not a very lovable character.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.629
Let's have a look at the coloring.

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:40.174
Uniform black above
from head to tail.

01:02:40.258 --> 01:02:43.094
A black rump, a black crown
with a bold white flash...

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:45.596
and a white line over the eye.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.224
The shrike lives in
lightly-wooded country.

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:52.770
Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:57.358
The shrike lives in lightly-wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:00.027
Herr Hendley,
have you taken to birds too now?

01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:02.822
You should stick around.
You might learn something.

01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:06.409
I have better things to do
than draw birds.

01:03:06.492 --> 01:03:09.912
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:15.418
Let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a good round shape.

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:39.900
Permission to cross the front here.
Here's another one.

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:42.403
Which one's the forgery?

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.948
- That one.
- That's right.

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:47.825
They both are.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:51.495
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:54.498
- We have no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:59.420
And a military identity card...

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.005
and 3..

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.757
An aus visa.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.759
Permission to be
on Reich property.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.802
A ticket to Odin and...

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:10.931
what looks like the ferrets' assignments
by day and hour for the next week.

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:14.268
- You get ten out of ten for this.
- Thank you.

01:04:14.352 --> 01:04:17.438
- Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.733
It's on loan.

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:25.237
In order to get the right
amount of outfits, Roger...

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:28.824
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:32.828
Now, I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds...

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:35.831
and rather nice lounge suits.

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:38.542
Lapels. I can do a lot
of things with those.

01:04:38.626 --> 01:04:41.295
I can have them deep like that...

01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:43.798
or high ones like that.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:48.052
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.054
What about buttons?

01:04:51.389 --> 01:04:53.432
Take a look at those.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.976
Here's one that I finished, Roger.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.653
Here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:09.365
Looks rather good.
What's up, Roger?

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:12.368
The goons would have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:16.997
That's Sorren's department. I've
started working on the other materials.

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:19.125
This blanket...

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:23.587
particularly the striped,
marvelous... coats.

01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:26.424
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:29.677
Those battle dresses,
they're a bit too short.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.557
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.851
Blanket ticking.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:41.313
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

01:05:43.274 --> 01:05:45.443
- Dyed, of course?
- Of course.

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:48.195
Just take a look at this, Roger.

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:50.072
This blanket material...

01:05:50.156 --> 01:05:53.534
we scrape this down
until it's really smooth...

01:05:53.576 --> 01:05:55.744
and then dye it
with boot polish.

01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:59.874
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:02.209
Where in God's name
did you get these from?

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:04.253
- Hendley.
- Where did he get them?

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.380
- I asked him that.
- What did he say?

01:06:06.422 --> 01:06:10.593
"Don't ask." Let me show you some of
the overcoats I've been working on.

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:43.209
Good morning, Hilts.

01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:47.963
If you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:50.132
- When?
- Seventeen days, seventh of July.

01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:52.176
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:54.678
Is Ives going with you?

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.430
Yeah, if he wants to.

01:06:57.765 --> 01:07:01.101
You know that Ives
is close to cracking?

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:03.187
Yeah.

01:07:05.314 --> 01:07:08.901
- Better he goes out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:15.783
Right.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:21.789
Hilts, it's possible for one man to get
out through the wire, even get away...

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:24.333
but there are, in fact...

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.378
a considerable number of people
besides yourself...

01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:29.797
in this camp
who are trying to escape.

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:32.967
I appreciate that.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:37.429
Something's coming...
I can feel it...

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:40.224
And it's coming right around
the corner at me, Squadron Leader.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:43.561
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:45.980
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:49.817
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:56.323
As I was saying, Hilts...

01:07:56.365 --> 01:07:59.368
we have maps of Germany;
general maps, that is.

01:07:59.451 --> 01:08:03.622
We have all the information that we need
for the escape routes out of Germany...

01:08:03.664 --> 01:08:06.667
but what we do not have...

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:09.503
Is a clear idea of what's
500 yards beyond those trees.

01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:12.840
Right. We've tried
every goon in the camp. No go.

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:16.343
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

01:08:16.427 --> 01:08:19.346
We want to know where we hit
the main roads. They must patrol them.

01:08:19.388 --> 01:08:21.348
Where the local
police stations are.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.727
Where they've got military roadblocks,
and most important of all...

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:28.939
we've got to know how to get from here
to the railway station.

01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:32.735
No. Absolutely not.

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:36.614
When I get through that wire, I'm not
gonna be making maps for you guys.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:39.116
I'm gonna be so far away,
you couldn't hear it...

01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:41.368
if they were shooting at me
with howitzers.

01:08:42.453 --> 01:08:44.288
That's understandable.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:45.873
Completely.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:50.044
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

01:08:53.672 --> 01:08:57.676
Interesting idea.
How many are you taking out?

01:08:57.718 --> 01:08:59.678
Two hundred and fifty.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.391
Two hundred and fifty?

01:09:04.558 --> 01:09:05.601
Yeah.

01:09:06.894 --> 01:09:08.896
You're crazy.
You oughta be locked up.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:12.524
Two hundred and fifty guys just
walking down the road, just like that?

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:15.361
Well, some on the road,
some by train...

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:16.862
some cross country.

01:09:16.904 --> 01:09:20.866
They'll have forged papers, clothes,
maps, compasses, rations.

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:24.078
Has it occurred to you that you're
gonna alert every goon in the country?

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:27.081
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

01:09:27.164 --> 01:09:31.418
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you
up so fast, it'd make your head swim.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:37.007
Well, thanks anyway.

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:39.426
Anything I can do to help
in the tunnel, let me know.

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:42.096
- That's very good of you.
- Anytime.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:45.849
Wait a minute.

01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:49.311
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire...

01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:52.314
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up...

01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:55.275
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler...

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:57.778
so you can get
the information you need?

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.904
Yes.

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:02.533
One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:05.953
- You'd get a front place in the tunnel.
- I wouldn't do that for my mother.

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.996
- I don't blame you.
- Okay then.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.958
- It's completely understandable.
- Okay then.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.212
Thanks, Hilts.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.304
Check.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:32.104
It's all right.
Blythe's a friend.

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.316
What's the matter?

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.987
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card, gone.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.115
I lost them, everything.

01:10:43.157 --> 01:10:45.117
He lost his wallet.

01:10:45.159 --> 01:10:48.620
Do you realize what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:51.290
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

01:10:53.876 --> 01:10:55.836
I've looked everyplace.

01:10:57.546 --> 01:11:00.841
I must have lost them
while I was in here.

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:02.468
- No.
- Yes.

01:11:03.761 --> 01:11:08.098
I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

01:11:08.182 --> 01:11:10.100
Thank you, Herr Hendley.

01:11:13.228 --> 01:11:16.440
Not now. It might look
a little peculiar...

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:19.359
if you and I were seen probing around
at this time of night.

01:11:21.153 --> 01:11:22.863
Look, I'll find them.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:26.366
I promise you, I'll find them
if I have to tear this room apart.

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:35.250
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:39.671
There is one small favor.

01:11:39.713 --> 01:11:41.006
A camera.

01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:47.179
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:52.684
Thirty-five millimeter
with 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:54.353
Focal plane shutter.

01:11:57.815 --> 01:12:01.193
That's a focal plane shutter.

01:12:01.235 --> 01:12:03.111
Let me know when you got it.

01:12:08.242 --> 01:12:10.744
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner...

01:12:10.786 --> 01:12:12.663
but I like him.

01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:14.331
Checkmate.

01:12:38.856 --> 01:12:42.442
- When will that air pump be ready?
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.

01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:46.321
You're badly behind schedule, Sedgwick.
How's it coming, Danny?

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:49.616
No good.
Today, three times.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.969
You all right?
Pull!

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:44.630
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger, all 335 feet.

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.507
Four times today.

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:51.762
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:54.681
That's a lot of timber.

01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:56.683
Can you get it?

01:13:58.936 --> 01:14:02.856
We'll get it.
We've gotta get it.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.443
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:09.279
Okay, Willie.

01:14:09.363 --> 01:14:12.866
<i>On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

01:14:12.908 --> 01:14:15.369
<i>A partridge in a pear tree</i>

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:26.338
<i>On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.632
<i>Four calling birds
three French hens</i>

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:32.719
<i>Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

01:14:32.803 --> 01:14:36.264
<i>On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me</i>

01:14:36.348 --> 01:14:39.226
<i>Five gold rings</i>

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.229
How's it going with the rafters?

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.439
Taking out 24.

01:14:49.987 --> 01:14:51.238
Stay with it.

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:36.575
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:38.243
Say, Cavendish...

01:15:42.122 --> 01:15:43.665
Alley-COP!

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.215
Never mind.

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:05.395
Here's a present
from our friend Werner.

01:16:05.479 --> 01:16:09.316
Splendid. Simply splendid.

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:12.986
This should do very nicely.

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:17.866
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:21.369
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

01:17:30.272 --> 01:17:34.568
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.903
Harry, of course,
isn't as far as that.

01:17:36.945 --> 01:17:38.947
How much further to the trees?

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.074
We make it 50 feet, sir.

01:17:41.158 --> 01:17:44.661
- Dark of the moon is the seventh...
- Eighth and ninth.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.663
A day earlier in August.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:54.504
Morning.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.757
There he goes again.

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:00.427
Why's he piling up
all the potatoes in the camp?

01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:03.430
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:06.099
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves
in their room every night.

01:18:06.183 --> 01:18:09.603
Sometimes Goff's in there with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:13.690
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry,
seal them off.

01:18:13.773 --> 01:18:16.776
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press right on into the trees.

01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:18.278
Right, Roger.

01:19:06.243 --> 01:19:07.661
Wow.

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.039
Wow.

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:14.501
Wow.

01:19:41.278 --> 01:19:42.445
Wow.

01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:50.787
Wow.

01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:00.755
Wow!

01:20:51.473 --> 01:20:52.807
About face!

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.852
Forward march!

01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:04.778
What is it?

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:07.322
They're celebrating the Revolution.

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.324
It's the Fourth of July.

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:20.543
What the devil's this?

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:26.216
Company, halt!

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:28.760
Gentlemen, you're invited for
free drinks at the wash deck.

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:31.012
A little present from the colonials.

01:21:31.096 --> 01:21:33.681
- Down the British.
- Quite right.

01:21:33.765 --> 01:21:37.519
- And a little drink to Tom.
- And to getting home.

01:21:37.602 --> 01:21:40.063
Very well. We accept.
Up the rebels.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:42.649
- Down the British.
- If you care to follow us.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:44.567
About face!

01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:46.569
Column, left! March!

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:05.588
Company, halt!

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.511
Let's line up.

01:22:25.275 --> 01:22:28.194
That explains
what happened to the potatoes.

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:31.030
No harm in closing down town
for one day, Roger.

01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:33.950
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:38.037
There's only 14 feet to go.
We can draw out the whole bloody camp.

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:41.249
- That calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear, sir.

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:43.543
Drink it up.

01:22:43.585 --> 01:22:47.046
Moonshine. American moonshine.
Moonshine.

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:49.674
- Cheers, Hendley.
- Drink it all.

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:51.259
Keep it moving.

01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:54.262
Hello, Eric.
Don't spill any of that.

01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:56.973
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

01:22:57.056 --> 01:23:00.435
All right, old timer.
Keep it moving.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:02.854
Don't get any on your clothes.

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:05.148
Don't get any on your clothes.

01:23:06.274 --> 01:23:08.526
- Before your morning tea?
- Tonic water.

01:23:08.568 --> 01:23:10.612
Keep it moving.

01:23:10.695 --> 01:23:14.032
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
American moonshine.

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:16.409
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

01:23:16.493 --> 01:23:19.412
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:36.804
Get good and stoned, my friend.

01:23:38.473 --> 01:23:40.642
Keep it going.
Keep it...

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:45.146
No taxation without representation.

01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.649
Keep it going, boys.
Keep it...

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.694
Keep it going.
Enjoy yourselves.

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:54.322
Well, let's drink to Tom.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:05.750
In the three years,
seven months...

01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:08.086
and approximately two weeks
that I've been in the bag...

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:10.713
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

01:24:10.797 --> 01:24:12.757
It's shattering.

01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:14.884
I think it's rather good.

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:20.473
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll "all an kaye."

01:24:21.808 --> 01:24:23.393
Call an aye.

01:24:43.621 --> 01:24:45.707
You know what that is?

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:48.001
I'll tell you what it isn't.

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.503
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:53.798
How do you like it, sir?

01:24:54.841 --> 01:24:56.843
Well, it's..

01:24:56.926 --> 01:24:58.928
To the colonies.

01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:00.513
Independence.

01:25:06.686 --> 01:25:11.024
How are you managing over there
without us? Getting along all right?

01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:14.277
We seem to be getting along
all right, sure... sir.

01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:24.203
Yes, well, it's...

01:25:25.997 --> 01:25:27.415
It's good stuff, Hilts.

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:32.211
Thank you, sir.

01:25:52.565 --> 01:25:54.817
Danny, here's to...

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:05.370
Goons in 105.

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:07.872
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

01:26:10.667 --> 01:26:14.962
We have to ignore it. If we pay any
heed, they'll know the hut's important.

01:26:16.631 --> 01:26:18.591
Here's to going home.

01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:36.818
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:38.319
Home.

01:26:51.582 --> 01:26:55.294
I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom.

01:26:58.005 --> 01:27:02.135
Never mind. You'll be walking down
Gale Street in a couple of weeks.

01:27:02.176 --> 01:27:03.761
To Tom.

01:27:03.803 --> 01:27:06.889
You know, I'm just beginning
to realize that myself.

01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:10.101
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.311
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.779
Oh, my God!
They've found Tom!

01:28:58.709 --> 01:29:00.628
It's the tunnel.

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:19.105
Success!

01:30:58.079 --> 01:31:00.873
Let me know
the exact information you need.

01:31:00.915 --> 01:31:03.626
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:07.838
Open up Harry.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.716
We dig around the clock.

01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:50.399
Cooler.

01:32:50.483 --> 01:32:51.901
Right.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.033
I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

01:32:59.116 --> 01:33:01.285
He wasn't caught.

01:33:14.924 --> 01:33:17.051
Hilts, welcome home.

01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:11.313
Danny?

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:14.942
Danny?

01:34:18.404 --> 01:34:19.613
Danny?

01:34:26.871 --> 01:34:28.873
Are you all right, Danny'?

01:34:30.833 --> 01:34:31.917
Yes.

01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:34.503
All right.

01:34:36.964 --> 01:34:40.176
All right.
Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

01:34:42.678 --> 01:34:45.264
For God's sakes, Smithy,
you've left out a whole bloody eagle.

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:46.932
That's impossible.

01:34:51.103 --> 01:34:53.355
Four days' work
up the bloody spout!

01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:57.443
I'm sorry, Collin.

01:34:57.484 --> 01:34:59.445
It's all right, Smithy.

01:35:00.571 --> 01:35:04.366
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up.

01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:06.452
All right.

01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:09.288
- Good night, Collin.
- Good night, Smithy.

01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:51.830
I can't see a bloody thing.

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:10.182
Heil Hitler.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:22.361
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:24.446
I've put in a lot of...

01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:28.867
It's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

01:36:28.951 --> 01:36:31.870
- Remember, German always.
- Righto.

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:48.679
One, two, three, four, five.

01:37:08.198 --> 01:37:09.241
Rogen

01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:15.789
No, it's me.

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:20.252
How do you like
the old escape suit?

01:37:20.336 --> 01:37:21.962
Fine, Collin.

01:37:29.011 --> 01:37:30.721
How do you like mine?

01:37:30.763 --> 01:37:32.973
It looks splendid.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:02.378
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

01:38:02.461 --> 01:38:05.964
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.887
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:14.723
Please, Willie, let me alone.

01:38:14.807 --> 01:38:17.601
I can't go
in that tunnel anymore...

01:38:17.643 --> 01:38:20.020
so I'm going out
through the wire.

01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:27.486
Think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

01:38:27.528 --> 01:38:30.697
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:32.199
I go out now.

01:38:33.826 --> 01:38:37.871
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:46.630
Don't do that.

01:38:52.469 --> 01:38:54.680
Since I was a boy...

01:38:54.763 --> 01:38:57.724
I hate and feared...

01:38:57.808 --> 01:39:01.395
little rooms, closets, caves.

01:39:01.478 --> 01:39:03.814
You've dug 17 tunnels.

01:39:03.856 --> 01:39:06.608
Because I must get out.

01:39:06.692 --> 01:39:09.653
I hide the fear and I dig.

01:39:10.779 --> 01:39:14.950
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men...

01:39:15.033 --> 01:39:17.703
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head...

01:39:17.786 --> 01:39:20.330
and ruin the escape
for everybody.

01:39:23.125 --> 01:39:25.043
So I go now.

01:39:29.882 --> 01:39:32.926
Danny, I'll see you
through the tunnel.

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:37.556
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:40.684
All right.

01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:52.196
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

01:39:52.237 --> 01:39:54.865
Well, how do you think we look?

01:39:58.577 --> 01:40:01.997
- It's as bad as all that?
- Collin, I...

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.960
I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:09.379
That's all right.
I had lots of help.

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:11.548
Lots of very good help.

01:40:12.633 --> 01:40:14.968
What's the matter, Roger'?

01:40:15.052 --> 01:40:16.386
You can't go.

01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:19.223
What do you mean?

01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:21.600
- I can't allow it.
- Why?

01:40:21.683 --> 01:40:24.603
Because you can't see
your hand in front of your face.

01:40:24.645 --> 01:40:26.647
You'll be caught
before you got ten yards.

01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:28.899
That's ridiculous.

01:40:30.192 --> 01:40:31.443
Ridiculous.

01:40:31.527 --> 01:40:34.071
I never heard anything
so absurd in my life.

01:40:34.112 --> 01:40:38.033
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!

01:40:38.116 --> 01:40:42.329
I can see that pin down there.
Does that satisfy you?

01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:44.331
What pin? Where?

01:40:56.009 --> 01:40:59.304
Collin, do you see
the foot of the door?

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:01.848
Of course.

01:41:03.934 --> 01:41:05.852
Put the pin down there.

01:41:07.145 --> 01:41:08.689
All right.

01:41:15.445 --> 01:41:17.364
Come on. Sit down.

01:41:18.949 --> 01:41:22.786
Sit down.
It was a good try.

01:41:22.828 --> 01:41:26.832
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

01:41:26.915 --> 01:41:28.542
It's too risky for you.

01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:30.544
Don't you think
that's Collin's decision?

01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:33.839
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

01:41:33.922 --> 01:41:38.510
We all know the score here.
At least most of us do.

01:41:38.552 --> 01:41:41.972
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front...

01:41:42.014 --> 01:41:45.392
to foul up the Germans
behind the lines, and that's fine.

01:41:45.475 --> 01:41:47.936
But once we get past
that barbed wire...

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:51.023
once we have them looking
all over Germany for us...

01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:53.483
that mission is accomplished.

01:41:53.525 --> 01:41:56.903
Afterwards,
we have some ideas of our own.

01:41:57.946 --> 01:42:01.325
You mean, getting home?
Back to your family and children?

01:42:01.366 --> 01:42:02.492
That's right.

01:42:02.534 --> 01:42:06.079
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

01:42:06.163 --> 01:42:08.081
I'm sure you have.

01:42:09.082 --> 01:42:11.918
I know Collin has.

01:42:12.002 --> 01:42:14.296
And, Roger, I have too.

01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:16.590
We think we can
make it all the way.

01:42:16.673 --> 01:42:21.345
Not Collin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the whole escape. That's my decision.

01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:25.557
You want to talk about hazard?
Let's talk about you.

01:42:25.599 --> 01:42:29.561
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

01:42:31.104 --> 01:42:33.440
No one has said you can't go.

01:42:34.941 --> 01:42:37.486
That's true.

01:42:37.569 --> 01:42:40.072
And I have thought
about the Gestapo.

01:42:41.948 --> 01:42:46.119
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go...

01:42:46.203 --> 01:42:48.955
or dare go...

01:42:49.039 --> 01:42:51.458
or should be permitted
to play God...

01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:55.253
I can't answer you.

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:58.131
But I can tell you...

01:42:58.215 --> 01:43:02.594
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
not only to himself but to the plan...

01:43:02.678 --> 01:43:05.389
and must therefore
be eliminated from the operation.

01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:19.486
Collin's not a blind man
as long as he's with me...

01:43:19.569 --> 01:43:21.613
and he's going with me.

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:28.870
It's all right with you?

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.960
Oh, yes. Quite.

01:43:42.134 --> 01:43:44.136
Very well.

01:43:44.219 --> 01:43:48.014
I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

01:43:48.849 --> 01:43:50.809
Good night, gentlemen.

01:43:57.733 --> 01:43:59.151
Actually...

01:44:00.819 --> 01:44:02.946
he's quite right.

01:44:02.988 --> 01:44:05.657
He's completely right.

01:44:05.741 --> 01:44:07.784
I really shouldn't go at all.

01:44:07.826 --> 01:44:11.329
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:14.499
I think they call it
"progressive myopia."

01:44:15.834 --> 01:44:18.503
I can see things up here, close to.

01:44:18.587 --> 01:44:21.506
I can see to work, but...

01:44:23.842 --> 01:44:25.302
you're just a blur.

01:44:26.386 --> 01:44:27.763
I know.

01:44:29.264 --> 01:44:32.976
Hell, we'll make it in great shape.
Collin, do you have any tea?

01:44:35.103 --> 01:44:38.398
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

01:44:39.357 --> 01:44:41.026
Splendid.

01:45:00.003 --> 01:45:01.171
Out.

01:45:27.113 --> 01:45:28.573
Hi, Hilts.

01:45:29.366 --> 01:45:30.784
Hey, Mac.

01:45:33.578 --> 01:45:35.205
When?

01:45:35.247 --> 01:45:37.916
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

01:45:37.958 --> 01:45:40.502
Me too.
Let's get at it.

01:45:40.585 --> 01:45:43.004
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

01:46:54.576 --> 01:46:55.827
What time?

01:46:58.163 --> 01:47:00.123
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

01:47:03.627 --> 01:47:05.295
Are you okay?

01:47:16.348 --> 01:47:18.391
Cavendish.

01:47:18.475 --> 01:47:20.894
Griffith, down there. Goff.

01:47:41.498 --> 01:47:43.750
Smith, Foles...

01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:45.752
third on the right.

01:47:45.835 --> 01:47:48.672
Blythe, Hendley,
third on the left.

01:48:18.702 --> 01:48:20.161
There are the lights.

01:48:21.579 --> 01:48:23.331
Right on the tick.

01:48:33.425 --> 01:48:35.051
Look down the tunnel.

01:48:35.093 --> 01:48:37.429
It's lovely.

01:48:39.222 --> 01:48:42.767
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

01:48:44.519 --> 01:48:46.604
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.695
I don't know.

01:48:57.073 --> 01:48:58.324
It's time.

01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:15.050
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.305
It's all clear, sir.

01:49:29.147 --> 01:49:31.107
We're all set, Roger.

01:49:45.455 --> 01:49:47.332
Good luck.

01:50:18.238 --> 01:50:20.448
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny...

01:50:20.532 --> 01:50:23.535
and then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

01:50:30.542 --> 01:50:34.462
Willie, I can't wait till it's over.

01:50:34.546 --> 01:50:36.047
I must get out.

01:51:08.121 --> 01:51:09.914
What's the matter?

01:51:09.956 --> 01:51:11.416
Danny, come here!

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:15.336
Danny and I will go later.
We'll take another place.

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.089
Tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

01:51:18.173 --> 01:51:20.425
This tunnel is mine
as much as anybody.

01:51:20.508 --> 01:51:23.595
I dug it, I built it,
I was buried many times.

01:51:23.636 --> 01:51:26.598
I go when I want.
Let me out.

01:51:30.268 --> 01:51:32.395
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out!

01:51:47.619 --> 01:51:49.746
Danny, what is it?

01:51:49.787 --> 01:51:52.040
What's going on?

01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:54.792
It's all right, Sedgwick.
We're going later.

01:52:02.467 --> 01:52:04.802
Danny, it's all right.

01:52:04.844 --> 01:52:07.805
We can take another place
in the line. It's all right.

01:52:08.765 --> 01:52:11.768
All right, Collin.
Down you go.

01:52:11.809 --> 01:52:13.394
Now sit down.

01:52:13.478 --> 01:52:16.689
Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot. Got it?

01:52:16.773 --> 01:52:18.191
Down you go.

01:52:33.998 --> 01:52:36.042
Danny cut out, huh?

01:52:36.125 --> 01:52:38.836
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I...

01:52:51.975 --> 01:52:54.894
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:02.628
All right?

01:54:02.712 --> 01:54:04.797
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20-feet short.

01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:06.883
What do you mean,
"20-feet short"?

01:54:06.924 --> 01:54:09.719
You're 20-feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

01:54:09.761 --> 01:54:11.971
The guard is between us
and the lights.

01:54:12.055 --> 01:54:14.098
How could that happen?
The survey took...

01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.059
What difference does it make?
It's happened!

01:54:32.367 --> 01:54:34.369
Damn it, Mac!
I'm trying to think!

01:54:35.661 --> 01:54:37.663
We could postpone it
till we dig to the trees.

01:54:37.747 --> 01:54:40.750
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

01:54:44.921 --> 01:54:48.299
One chance. When the guard goes
to the far end of the compound...

01:54:48.341 --> 01:54:50.301
you might be able
to move your men out.

01:54:50.343 --> 01:54:52.678
I can make it to the woods,
signal when you're clear.

01:54:53.846 --> 01:54:56.182
- What about the towers?
- You'll have to take a chance.

01:54:56.265 --> 01:54:58.976
They're gonna be watching the compound,
not the woods.

01:55:03.272 --> 01:55:05.817
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:08.361
Send down 30 feet of rope!

01:55:09.987 --> 01:55:12.698
Send down 30 feet of rope.

01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:16.452
Send down 30 feet of rope.

01:55:18.121 --> 01:55:21.040
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

01:55:36.848 --> 01:55:40.143
- How's it going, Tommy?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

01:55:41.352 --> 01:55:44.355
- Have they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

01:56:07.962 --> 01:56:09.547
He's over there.

01:56:15.970 --> 01:56:18.055
All right.
You go first, Eric.

01:56:19.056 --> 01:56:21.058
I'm staying here
till we get moving.

01:56:32.653 --> 01:56:34.947
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

01:56:35.031 --> 01:56:36.824
Right.

01:56:49.587 --> 01:56:50.963
Thank you.

01:56:51.047 --> 01:56:53.633
- Good luck.
- Right.

01:57:17.907 --> 01:57:19.325
We're moving.

01:57:26.457 --> 01:57:29.460
They're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.

01:57:33.297 --> 01:57:35.341
Danny, when Warsaw fell...

01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:38.803
you escaped and came to England
because you're a flyer.

01:57:38.886 --> 01:57:41.931
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

01:57:43.266 --> 01:57:46.310
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:50.481
Danny, if you don't go
through that tunnel...

01:57:50.565 --> 01:57:53.484
everything you've done
will have been for nothing!

01:58:22.972 --> 01:58:24.974
- Blythe behind, Mac.
- Right.

01:58:27.518 --> 01:58:29.895
- In here, Collin.
- Come on.

01:58:29.979 --> 01:58:31.564
Sit down.

01:58:36.736 --> 01:58:38.904
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.

01:58:42.658 --> 01:58:44.577
Have you got a piano in here?

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.704
That's very funny, mate.

01:58:46.746 --> 01:58:49.415
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

01:58:52.585 --> 01:58:54.920
Was that Sedgwick
with his steamer trunk?

01:58:55.004 --> 01:58:58.090
- Who else?
- I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

01:59:04.972 --> 01:59:06.891
- We're 20-feet short.
- How the hell...

01:59:06.974 --> 01:59:10.811
We're 20-feet short. Hilts is on the
other end of that rope, in the woods.

01:59:10.895 --> 01:59:14.273
When you feel a few tugs, off you go,
but keep Collin low going across.

01:59:14.357 --> 01:59:15.566
Right.

01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:18.569
- Good luck, Collin.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:59:28.412 --> 01:59:29.622
What's that?

01:59:31.123 --> 01:59:32.458
It's an air raid.

01:59:32.541 --> 01:59:34.210
Oh, God, no!

01:59:34.251 --> 01:59:37.012
The goons will pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

01:59:37.963 --> 01:59:40.257
Come on. We can get out
when the lights go down.

01:59:58.984 --> 02:00:01.612
It's an air raid!
Searchlights are out! Come on!

02:00:08.494 --> 02:00:09.954
Get 'em out!

02:00:15.626 --> 02:00:17.628
It's gonna cave!

02:00:17.712 --> 02:00:20.005
Danny, it's all right.

02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:22.299
It's the lights.

02:00:23.092 --> 02:00:25.302
Light the fat lamps down there!

02:00:26.512 --> 02:00:29.598
There's been an air raid.
They cut the lights.

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:32.393
In the tunnel, it's all right.
Listen to me.

02:00:34.228 --> 02:00:35.646
Danny, look.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.902
Come on, fellas. Move!

02:00:41.986 --> 02:00:44.071
We can get dozens out
in this darkness!

02:00:50.828 --> 02:00:53.038
What the hell's going on?

02:00:53.122 --> 02:00:55.458
- You go.
- No, Danny.

02:00:56.584 --> 02:00:58.669
I'm all right. Go.

02:01:07.178 --> 02:01:09.305
- What is it?
- I brought Danny back.

02:01:09.346 --> 02:01:11.515
- Is he stuck?
- No, he's all right.

02:01:11.557 --> 02:01:13.851
Well, get him out, fast!

02:01:16.353 --> 02:01:18.314
Come on!

02:01:20.733 --> 02:01:22.359
Come on. Move!

02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:40.252
Go.

02:01:46.884 --> 02:01:48.677
Give me your bag.

02:01:55.559 --> 02:01:57.228
We're on the rope!

02:02:42.773 --> 02:02:46.360
We had better get out of here,
or we won't catch any of the trains.

02:02:46.443 --> 02:02:49.446
It's moving. We'll pass
the instructions from man to man.

02:02:51.574 --> 02:02:53.492
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

02:03:40.247 --> 02:03:42.499
Come on. Come on.

02:04:01.268 --> 02:04:02.478
Come on.

02:04:20.955 --> 02:04:22.623
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

02:04:23.374 --> 02:04:25.292
Don't shoot!

02:04:25.376 --> 02:04:26.919
Don't shoot!

02:04:32.174 --> 02:04:34.301
Get out!
They're coming back!

02:04:57.574 --> 02:05:00.577
Oh, boy! There's a lot of shooting
going on up there.

02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:03.221
You think they've been shooting them
one by one as they came out?

02:05:03.247 --> 02:05:05.749
It couldn't be. We would've
heard the shots before.

02:05:08.585 --> 02:05:10.713
- Pull!
- Wait for me.

02:05:10.754 --> 02:05:12.172
Don't worry.

02:05:17.094 --> 02:05:18.554
Cut!

02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:41.201
Out.

02:06:15.736 --> 02:06:17.821
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

02:06:17.863 --> 02:06:19.948
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

02:06:34.797 --> 02:06:35.881
Dismissed.

02:06:35.964 --> 02:06:37.549
Atten-hut!

02:07:34.231 --> 02:07:37.526
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up in this station.

02:07:37.568 --> 02:07:40.571
Ashley-Pitt, Roger,
MacDonald, Nimmo.

02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:42.739
Makes quite a group.

02:07:42.781 --> 02:07:44.783
What do we do?

02:07:44.867 --> 02:07:46.618
Wait for the train.

02:13:51.358 --> 02:13:52.776
Tallyho.

02:14:36.319 --> 02:14:37.821
Tallyho.

02:15:11.062 --> 02:15:13.898
- Are the police on the train?
- Yes, and the Gestapo are with them.

02:15:13.982 --> 02:15:16.067
- We're gonna jump.
- All right.

02:15:21.823 --> 02:15:25.243
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you give me a firm push.

02:15:45.263 --> 02:15:48.391
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

02:15:48.433 --> 02:15:50.060
That was quite exciting.

02:15:52.103 --> 02:15:55.690
- It isn't stopping?
- No, we're all right.

02:16:51.287 --> 02:16:52.706
Switzerland.

02:21:35.405 --> 02:21:36.572
Bartlett.

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.800
Where were you going, Cavendish?

02:22:37.842 --> 02:22:40.762
I hadn't quite decided.

02:22:40.803 --> 02:22:43.556
What information
were you to collect on the way?

02:22:43.639 --> 02:22:44.724
None.

02:22:44.807 --> 02:22:47.518
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

02:22:47.602 --> 02:22:49.979
What have you done
with your papers?

02:22:51.481 --> 02:22:52.815
"Papers"?

02:22:52.857 --> 02:22:55.193
Forged papers and identity cards.

02:22:55.276 --> 02:22:58.529
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

02:22:58.613 --> 02:23:00.865
All I did was to escape
from a prison camp.

02:23:00.948 --> 02:23:03.743
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

02:23:04.494 --> 02:23:05.995
I wanted to get home.

02:23:06.037 --> 02:23:08.498
I don't think you'll ever see
your wife and children again.

02:23:08.581 --> 02:23:11.334
You've obviously got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

02:23:11.417 --> 02:23:13.503
You're wearing civilian clothes.

02:23:15.004 --> 02:23:18.424
You are a spy.
Spies are being shot.

02:23:18.508 --> 02:23:22.303
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:27.100
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover oil smears...

02:23:27.183 --> 02:23:29.185
I picked up
when I was shot down.

02:23:39.987 --> 02:23:42.073
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

02:23:43.074 --> 02:23:45.034
That's right.

02:23:49.914 --> 02:23:51.958
- Now, look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:18.568
Hello, boys.

02:24:23.156 --> 02:24:24.574
Hello.

02:24:27.326 --> 02:24:29.412
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

02:24:31.205 --> 02:24:33.708
Wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

02:24:33.749 --> 02:24:36.377
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

02:24:54.353 --> 02:24:56.814
There's a trainer out there
I can fly.

02:24:56.898 --> 02:24:59.525
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

02:26:07.677 --> 02:26:08.928
Collin.

02:26:09.679 --> 02:26:12.765
When I say, "Go,"
crank this clockwise.

02:26:12.848 --> 02:26:16.018
When the engine catches, don't move
or you'll get a mouthful of propeller.

02:26:30.866 --> 02:26:32.034
Go!

02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:23.919
Next stop, Switzerland.

02:28:46.377 --> 02:28:47.837
The Alps.

02:28:48.879 --> 02:28:50.214
Splendid.

02:29:02.184 --> 02:29:05.354
Over this range, then 20 more minutes,
we've got it made.

02:29:33.215 --> 02:29:34.758
What is it? Petrol?

02:29:34.842 --> 02:29:37.261
I don't know. Fuel pump,
carburetor. We're losing power.

02:30:02.369 --> 02:30:04.413
Go that way! I'll follow!

02:30:29.897 --> 02:30:31.023
Hendley?

02:30:35.945 --> 02:30:37.071
Collin?

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:43.619
Stop! Don't shoot!

02:30:48.123 --> 02:30:50.292
Collin?

02:30:50.376 --> 02:30:52.378
I'm sorry I fouled things up.

02:30:53.796 --> 02:30:55.464
That's all right.

02:30:56.715 --> 02:30:58.259
Thank you for...

02:30:59.552 --> 02:31:01.053
getting me...

02:31:01.136 --> 02:31:02.471
out.

02:34:40.481 --> 02:34:43.275
Hello? Hello?

02:35:22.064 --> 02:35:24.399
Resistance. Resistance?

02:35:25.734 --> 02:35:27.903
You are English?

02:35:27.945 --> 02:35:29.571
I'm Australian.

02:35:31.573 --> 02:35:33.492
You can speak English.
I understand.

02:35:33.575 --> 02:35:35.536
Bloody good.

02:35:35.577 --> 02:35:39.915
I'm a British officer. I've just escaped
from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

02:35:39.957 --> 02:35:42.251
I'm trying to make my way
into Spain now.

02:35:42.334 --> 02:35:44.920
You understand me?
Can you help me now?

02:35:49.258 --> 02:35:51.718
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

02:36:36.305 --> 02:36:38.307
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

02:36:39.433 --> 02:36:40.851
Cut!

02:37:44.331 --> 02:37:46.333
Halt! Halt!

02:38:32.713 --> 02:38:34.214
You are English?

02:39:15.756 --> 02:39:17.257
Herr Bartlett?

02:39:25.057 --> 02:39:27.476
Your German is good...

02:39:27.517 --> 02:39:29.644
and I hear also your French.

02:39:31.813 --> 02:39:34.649
Your arms up!

02:40:11.061 --> 02:40:13.522
Herr Bartlett...

02:40:13.605 --> 02:40:16.066
and Herr MacDonald.

02:40:18.902 --> 02:40:21.029
We are together again.

02:40:21.071 --> 02:40:24.699
You are going to wish you had never
put us to so much trouble.

02:40:41.508 --> 02:40:43.218
What's troubling you?

02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:45.262
I'm just a little surprised.

02:40:45.345 --> 02:40:48.723
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

02:40:48.807 --> 02:40:50.058
Yes.

02:40:50.976 --> 02:40:53.603
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried.

02:40:53.687 --> 02:40:56.356
I hope to God I haven't blotted
70-odd ledgers.

02:40:56.398 --> 02:40:58.567
Oh, no.

02:40:58.608 --> 02:41:02.070
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

02:41:02.154 --> 02:41:05.365
We'd never have got as far as we did
without you, Roger.

02:41:05.407 --> 02:41:08.451
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

02:41:09.619 --> 02:41:11.329
I think we all did.

02:41:11.413 --> 02:41:12.747
Yes.

02:41:51.953 --> 02:41:55.832
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

02:41:55.916 --> 02:41:59.294
It'll take hours
before you reach the camp.

02:42:20.649 --> 02:42:22.609
You know, Mac, all this...

02:42:22.651 --> 02:42:26.238
the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry...

02:42:26.321 --> 02:42:27.822
kept me alive.

02:42:28.907 --> 02:42:30.825
And even though we...

02:42:32.494 --> 02:42:34.537
I've never been happier.

02:42:35.455 --> 02:42:36.957
You know, Mac...

02:43:17.998 --> 02:43:20.959
Eleven of your men
are being returned today.

02:43:21.042 --> 02:43:22.877
Oh? Who?

02:43:22.961 --> 02:43:24.963
I do not have that information.

02:43:28.008 --> 02:43:31.219
I am directed by high authority
to inform you that...

02:43:33.596 --> 02:43:37.225
That 50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:39.853
"Shot"?

02:43:41.146 --> 02:43:45.358
Their personal effects
will be returned.

02:43:47.819 --> 02:43:49.529
How many were wounded?

02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:53.950
Here are the names...

02:43:54.034 --> 02:43:55.910
of the dead.

02:43:58.455 --> 02:44:00.457
How many of the 50 were wounded?

02:44:02.375 --> 02:44:03.752
None.

02:44:04.753 --> 02:44:08.089
They... The high authority...

02:44:08.173 --> 02:44:11.092
only directs me
to inform you that...

02:44:13.887 --> 02:44:15.555
That 50 men were...

02:44:21.853 --> 02:44:23.104
I see.

02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:26.816
Addison, John.

02:44:27.442 --> 02:44:28.943
Alladale, Peter.

02:44:29.444 --> 02:44:31.363
Bancroft, Edward.

02:44:31.654 --> 02:44:33.615
Bartlett, Roger.

02:44:33.948 --> 02:44:35.617
Cavendish, Dennis.

02:44:36.076 --> 02:44:38.495
Eldridge, David.

02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:41.122
Felton, William.

02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:44.376
Fanshaw, Arthur.

02:46:07.959 --> 02:46:09.961
I am your guide, señor.

02:46:10.044 --> 02:46:11.421
Spain?

02:46:33.568 --> 02:46:36.112
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

02:46:36.196 --> 02:46:38.531
- How many have been brought back, sir?
- You're the first.

02:46:38.573 --> 02:46:40.575
- Do you know how many got away, sir?
- Not yet.

02:46:41.951 --> 02:46:43.286
What happened to Blythe?

02:46:45.121 --> 02:46:47.332
He didn't make it, sir.

02:46:47.415 --> 02:46:49.584
Roger was right about that.

02:46:50.502 --> 02:46:52.670
Roger didn't make it either.

02:46:55.715 --> 02:46:59.636
I just posted the list.
They shot 50.

02:46:59.719 --> 02:47:01.804
The Gestapo murdered them.

02:47:03.556 --> 02:47:07.060
Fifty? MacDonald?
Ashley-Pitt?

02:47:07.936 --> 02:47:10.063
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

02:47:10.104 --> 02:47:12.106
No, they're not on the list.

02:47:12.190 --> 02:47:15.151
- Haynes?
- Yes.

02:47:16.694 --> 02:47:18.071
I'm sorry.

02:47:20.156 --> 02:47:23.743
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

02:47:23.785 --> 02:47:26.037
Mess up their works.

02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:29.332
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

02:47:29.415 --> 02:47:31.960
Do you think
it was worth the price?

02:47:33.169 --> 02:47:35.672
That depends on
your point of view.

02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:40.134
Yes, sir.

02:48:30.143 --> 02:48:32.145
He is not to be saluted.

02:48:32.186 --> 02:48:34.606
He's no longer in command.

02:48:41.863 --> 02:48:44.157
Job just didn't work out, huh?

02:48:44.198 --> 02:48:46.200
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- "Lucky"?

02:48:46.284 --> 02:48:48.286
It won't be because I didn't...

02:48:49.787 --> 02:48:51.122
How many?

02:48:51.831 --> 02:48:52.832
Fifty.

02:48:55.293 --> 02:49:00.465
It looks, after all, as if you
will see Berlin before I do.

02:49:53.101 --> 02:49:54.394
Sir.

02:50:01.776 --> 02:50:03.152
Hey, Hilts.
