01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.416
Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.993
<i>She wants to speak
to the Herr Direktor.</i>

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.148
Yes.

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.731
He won't see you.

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.392
Please, sit down.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.109
Pernod? Cognac?

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.603
No. No, thank you.

01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:31.527
So, what can I do for you?

01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:39.285
They say that no one dies here.

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.492
They say your
factory is a haven.

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.455
They say you are good.

01:33:49.582 --> 01:33:50.799
Who says that?

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:53.378
Everyone.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.062
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:06.563
I've been living in Krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.609
My parents are in Plaszow.

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:12.986
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:16.694
They are older people. They are
killing older people now in Plaszow.

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:20.076
They bury them up
in the forest. Look,

01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:23.791
I don't have any money.

01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:26.791
I borrowed these clothes.

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:32.751
I'm begging you. Please.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.465
Please bring them here.

01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:38.139
I don't do that.

01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:41.935
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.853
Whether or not the worker
has certain skills.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.396
That's what I ask
and that's what I care about.

01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:47.894
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:51.444
Such activities are illegal. You will
not entrap me! (CONTINUES ARGUING)

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:57.112

Great!

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.962
What am I
supposed to do about it?

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:15.794
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.721
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:22.676
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.853
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.772
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.976
and people with no
skills whatsoever!

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.989
You think I don't
know what you're doing?

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:39.534
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:40.781
Are you losing money?

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:42.074
That's not the point!

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.121
So the point is?

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.207
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

01:35:50.536 --> 01:35:54.006
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.710
You have to think of
it in his situation.

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.346
He's got this
whole place to run.

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:03.265
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:05.435
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:10.686
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:14.645
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:21.281
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. He'd be all right.

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.408
There'd just be the good
aspects of him, which...

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.488
(CHUCKLES)

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.332
He's a wonderful crook.

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:32.709
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:34.289
Killing.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.133
He can't enjoy it.

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:41.630
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.966
from a work detail
outside the wire.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.144
<i>Goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.</i>

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:51.974
<i>He shot the man to the left of
Bejski, the man to the right of him.</i>

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:55.230
<i>He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.</i>

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.568
Twenty-five.

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:09.100
What do you want
me to do about it?

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.617
Nothing, nothing.

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.711

You don't have to
report to me, Helen.

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.452
You know who I am? Hmm?

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:23.083
(WHISPERING) I'm Schindler.

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:27.671
Of course.
I have heard, and

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:31.549
you have been here before.

01:39:33.843 --> 01:39:36.392
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:38.389
Go on, take it.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:40.107
I get extra food here.

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:44.689
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.

01:39:47.565 --> 01:39:49.784
Why not build yourself up?

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:58.455
My first day here, he beat me

01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:02.334
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:10.176
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:12.757
He asked me where they were.

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:19.223
For his dogs, you understand.

01:40:22.308 --> 01:40:26.233
I said to him,
I don't know how I say this.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:30.067
I never could say it now,
I said to him,

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:32.402
"Why are you beating me?"

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.583
He said, "The reason
I beat you now

01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:43.289
is because you
ask why I beat you."

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:47.333
I know your sufferings, Helen.

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.255
It doesn't matter.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.976
I have accepted them.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.596
Accepted them?

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.732
One day he will shoot me.

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:06.687
No, no, no, he won't shoot you.

01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:09.522
I know. I see things.

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.739
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:17.322
<i>and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the from door</i>

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:23.253
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:28.083
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:31.009
shot a woman who
was passing by.

01:41:32.378 --> 01:41:35.632
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:39.390
Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?

01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:43.098
She was no fatter or thinner

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.774
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:50.026
and I couldn't
guess what had she done.

01:41:54.525 --> 01:41:57.699
<i>The more you see of
the Herr Kommandant,</i>

01:41:57.778 --> 01:42:03.376
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:08.173
You can't say to yourself, "If I
follow these rules, I will be safe."

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:15.839
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.469
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:22.144
He doesn't want
anyone else to know

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.938
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:31.187
He shot the woman
from the steps

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:34.991
because she meant
nothing to him.

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.823
She was one of a series,

01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:40.576

or pleasing him.

01:42:44.533 --> 01:42:46.752

01:42:51.123 --> 01:42:55.594

SCHINDLER:
Is that why they fear us?

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:21.973
We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.

01:44:22.047 --> 01:44:25.847
They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.849
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.852
We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:33.901
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.943
That's not power, though.

01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:42.444
That's justice.
It's different than power.

01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:50.373
Power is when we have
everyjustification to kill,

01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:52.874
and we don't.

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:55.878
You think that's power?

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:02.096
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:03.673
he's brought in
before the emperor,

01:45:03.756 --> 01:45:08.011
he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.

01:45:08.093 --> 01:45:10.471
He knows he's going to die.

01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:16.986
And the emperor pardons him.

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:21.441

He lets him go.

That's power, Amon.

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:35.250

02:15:39.506 --> 02:15:43.306
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:46.309
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing

02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:47.852
us down, sending
everybody to Auschwitz.

02:15:47.931 --> 02:15:48.932
When?

02:15:49.016 --> 02:15:50.859
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

02:15:50.934 --> 02:15:54.689
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

02:16:15.626 --> 02:16:16.923
SCHINDLER:
I've been talking to Goeth.

02:16:17.044 --> 02:16:18.341
I know the destination.

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.639
These are
the evacuation orders.

02:16:21.215 --> 02:16:24.185
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

02:16:24.259 --> 02:16:26.603
That's not what I
was going to say.

02:16:27.471 --> 02:16:30.850
I made Goeth promise me he'll
put in a good word for you.

02:16:31.392 --> 02:16:33.112
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you there.

02:16:33.143 --> 02:16:34.770
You'll receive
special treatment.

02:16:34.895 --> 02:16:36.568
The directives
coming in from Berlin

02:16:36.647 --> 02:16:38.741
mention "special treatment"
more and more often.

02:16:38.816 --> 02:16:40.818
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.

02:16:40.943 --> 02:16:42.570
Preferential treatment,
all right?

02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:45.169
Do we have to invent
a whole new language?

02:16:45.614 --> 02:16:46.615
I think so.

02:16:50.452 --> 02:16:52.170
You're staying, I take it.

02:16:56.375 --> 02:16:58.298
In Krakow? What on Earth for?

02:16:58.419 --> 02:17:00.296
What for? You have
a business to run.

02:17:02.631 --> 02:17:04.725
Of course, you'll have to hire new workers.
Poles, I guess.

02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:07.053
They cost a little more, but...

02:17:09.972 --> 02:17:11.690
What are you going to do?

02:17:15.644 --> 02:17:17.567
You ran my business.

02:17:21.483 --> 02:17:23.326
No, I'm going home.

02:17:23.569 --> 02:17:25.037
I've done what I came here for.

02:17:25.112 --> 02:17:28.662
I've got more money than any
man can spend in a lifetime.

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:44.674
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:51.563
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

02:17:55.851 --> 02:17:57.979
I think I better have it now.

02:18:21.376 --> 02:18:22.753
<i>(GOD BLESS THE CHILD PLAYING)</i>

02:18:22.836 --> 02:18:26.716
<i>Bible says And it still is news</i>

02:18:28.091 --> 02:18:33.894
<i>Mama may have Papa may have</i>

02:18:34.848 --> 02:18:39.854
<i>But God bless the child
That's got his own</i>

02:18:40.103 --> 02:18:42.822
<i>That's got his own</i>

02:18:46.777 --> 02:18:51.078
<i>Yes, the strong gets more</i>

02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.084
<i>While the weak ones fade</i>

02:18:55.994 --> 02:19:01.672
<i>Empty pockets don't

02:19:02.459 --> 02:19:07.841
<i>Mama may have Papa may have</i>

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:14.430
<i>But God bless the child

02:19:15.264 --> 02:19:18.268
<i>That's got his own</i>

02:19:23.647 --> 02:19:29.199
<i>Money,
you've got lots of friends</i>

02:19:32.072 --> 02:19:34.700
<i>They're pounding on your...</i>

02:19:34.908 --> 02:19:38.879
GOETH: I don't understand.
You want these people?

02:19:39.079 --> 02:19:41.502
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.

02:19:41.582 --> 02:19:44.586
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

02:19:44.668 --> 02:19:46.261
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

02:19:46.336 --> 02:19:47.428
It's good business.

02:19:47.504 --> 02:19:49.552
It's good business
in your opinion.

02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:52.726
Look, you've got to move
them, the equipment,

02:19:52.801 --> 02:19:54.223
everything to Czechoslovakia.

02:19:54.303 --> 02:19:57.603
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

02:19:57.681 --> 02:19:59.308
Look, Amon...
It's good for me.

02:19:59.474 --> 02:20:01.067
You're not
telling me something.

02:20:01.143 --> 02:20:03.111
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

02:20:03.186 --> 02:20:04.426
You're not
telling me something.

02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:05.738
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

02:20:05.814 --> 02:20:07.566
That's right.
It's good for the army.

02:20:07.649 --> 02:20:08.946
Yeah, of course.

02:20:08.984 --> 02:20:11.157
You know what I'm going to make?
What?

02:20:11.486 --> 02:20:13.329
Artillery shells. Everyone's
making artillery shells.

02:20:13.405 --> 02:20:15.123
Tank shells, they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.

02:20:15.198 --> 02:20:18.042
Everybody's happy.
Everyone's happy, except me.

02:20:18.118 --> 02:20:20.997
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

02:20:21.413 --> 02:20:24.417
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

02:20:24.499 --> 02:20:27.969
And if you admit to 300, then
it's 400, actually. But how?

02:20:28.045 --> 02:20:29.388
I just told you.

02:20:29.504 --> 02:20:30.881
You did, but you didn't.

02:20:33.842 --> 02:20:35.844
Ja, all right, don't tell me.

02:20:36.094 --> 02:20:40.270
I'll go along with it. It's just
irritating I can't work it out.

02:20:40.474 --> 02:20:44.195
Look, all you have to do is
tell me what it's worth to you.

02:20:45.437 --> 02:20:47.940
What's a person worth to you?
No, no, no, no.

02:20:48.023 --> 02:20:50.151
What's one worth to you?

02:20:58.825 --> 02:21:02.375
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

02:21:03.205 --> 02:21:04.297
And...

02:21:06.249 --> 02:21:08.593
Uh... Stagel, Stagel...

02:21:08.669 --> 02:21:10.137
Paul.
Paul Stagel.

02:21:10.504 --> 02:21:11.596
STERN: Doctor.

02:21:13.966 --> 02:21:17.721
The investors. I want all of them.
Yes, sir.

02:21:18.762 --> 02:21:20.389
Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

02:21:20.514 --> 02:21:23.393
Fischer, Ismail.

02:21:24.059 --> 02:21:25.732
Josef Scharf.

02:21:25.852 --> 02:21:27.525
One moment, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

02:21:27.646 --> 02:21:29.114
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

02:21:32.734 --> 02:21:34.907
The children.
All the children.

02:21:40.409 --> 02:21:42.411
STERN: Herbert Stier.
SCHINDLER: Thank you.

02:21:42.911 --> 02:21:44.504
How many?

02:21:44.621 --> 02:21:46.248
Four hundred, 450.

02:21:49.418 --> 02:21:50.761
More, more.

02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:18.910
Feigenbaum, Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:29.375
Feigenbaum, Lutek, Jakob...
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

02:22:29.458 --> 02:22:31.210
Nacha, that's right.

02:22:31.626 --> 02:22:32.627
SCHINDLER: And Wolf.

02:22:33.795 --> 02:22:35.047
How many?

02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:40.265
600.
More.

02:22:42.763 --> 02:22:44.185
SCHINDLER: You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

02:22:44.306 --> 02:22:45.728
You might even
make money at it.

02:22:45.807 --> 02:22:46.808
MADRITSCH: I don't know.

02:22:46.892 --> 02:22:49.611
Come on, Julius, I know about the
extra food and clothes you give them.

02:22:49.686 --> 02:22:51.438
Paid for out of
your own pocket.

02:22:51.521 --> 02:22:53.114
If we make a combined
approach, we could

02:22:53.231 --> 02:22:54.824
get more than 4,000 out,
mine and yours.

02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:55.901
Oskar...

02:22:55.984 --> 02:22:59.454
We could relocate them in something
like safety, in Moravia.

02:23:00.197 --> 02:23:01.323
I don't know.

02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:05.957
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

02:23:06.453 --> 02:23:07.500
Too many.

02:23:07.579 --> 02:23:10.753
For every one... (COUGHS)
you smoke, I smoke half.

02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:14.761
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

02:23:14.836 --> 02:23:16.509
No, Oskar, I can't do any more.

02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:18.257
I will not accept that.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.808
No.

02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:31.228
How many? How many?

02:23:31.353 --> 02:23:32.730
850, give or take.

02:23:32.813 --> 02:23:36.192
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

02:23:47.327 --> 02:23:50.297
That's it.
You can finish that page.

02:23:55.585 --> 02:23:59.306
What did Goeth say about this?

02:23:59.381 --> 02:24:02.726
You just told him how many
people you needed and...

02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:08.272
You're not buying them.

02:24:11.351 --> 02:24:14.446
You're buying them? You're paying
him for each of these names?

02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:15.943
If you were
still working for me,

02:24:16.064 --> 02:24:17.486
I'd expect you to
talk me out of it.

02:24:17.566 --> 02:24:19.409
It's costing me a fortune.

02:24:21.778 --> 02:24:25.032
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:48.597
You...

02:24:55.312 --> 02:24:57.781
The list is an absolute good.

02:24:59.733 --> 02:25:02.156
The list is life.

02:25:04.196 --> 02:25:07.746
All around its
margins lies the gulf.

02:25:09.451 --> 02:25:11.453
Oskar,
there's a clerical error here

02:25:11.578 --> 02:25:13.546
at the bottom of the last page.

02:25:13.622 --> 02:25:16.045
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

02:25:16.124 --> 02:25:18.798
<i>I'll never find a maid as well
trained as her at Brinnlitz.</i>

02:25:18.877 --> 02:25:20.379
<i>They are all country girls.</i>

02:25:22.005 --> 02:25:23.097
No.

02:25:32.766 --> 02:25:33.858
No.

02:25:34.684 --> 02:25:35.685
One hand of 21.

02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:36.857
No.

02:25:36.937 --> 02:25:39.736
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks. No.

02:25:39.814 --> 02:25:42.658
Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
No.

02:25:43.735 --> 02:25:45.783
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

02:25:47.239 --> 02:25:48.639
I can't wager Helen
in a carol game.

02:25:48.698 --> 02:25:50.075
Why not?

02:25:50.158 --> 02:25:51.330
Wouldn't be right.

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:53.161
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

02:25:53.245 --> 02:25:55.122
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

02:25:55.205 --> 02:25:57.503
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her

02:25:57.624 --> 02:25:59.922
to come back to Vienna with me.

02:26:00.001 --> 02:26:02.971
I want her to come
to work for me there.

02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:04.514
I want to grow old with her.

02:26:04.631 --> 02:26:05.974
Are you mad?

02:26:08.009 --> 02:26:11.104
Amon, you can't take
her to Vienna with you.

02:26:11.513 --> 02:26:13.265
No, of course I can't.

02:26:14.182 --> 02:26:16.059
That's what I'd like to do.

02:26:16.977 --> 02:26:19.730
What I can do,
if I'm any sort of a man,

02:26:19.854 --> 02:26:22.653
is the next most
merciful thing.

02:26:22.732 --> 02:26:25.110
I shall take her
into the woods and

02:26:25.235 --> 02:26:27.658
shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:40.709
What was it you
said for a natural 21?

02:26:41.793 --> 02:26:44.387
Was it 14,800?

02:26:44.546 --> 02:26:47.220
<i>Schindlerjuden to these tables!
Say your names clearly.</i>

02:26:47.299 --> 02:26:49.768
We are the family Dresner.

02:26:49.884 --> 02:26:52.387
Juda, Jonas, Donata, and Chaja.

02:26:54.139 --> 02:26:55.732
We are Rosners.
Henry, Manci...

02:26:55.890 --> 02:26:57.483
And Leo.

02:26:57.892 --> 02:26:59.485
And our son.
I am Olek.

02:27:00.979 --> 02:27:02.231
Maria Mischel.

02:27:02.605 --> 02:27:04.107
Chaim Nowak.

02:27:05.608 --> 02:27:07.406
Wulkan, Markus.

02:27:07.986 --> 02:27:09.488
Michael Lemper.

02:27:10.989 --> 02:27:12.832
Itzhak Stern.

02:27:13.616 --> 02:27:15.835
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:19.043
Rosalia Nussbaum.
Wilhelm Nussbaum.

02:27:20.123 --> 02:27:21.875
Jakob Levartov.

02:27:22.917 --> 02:27:25.045
Farber, Rosa.
Farber, Andrzej.

02:27:25.879 --> 02:27:26.926
Sara.

02:27:27.088 --> 02:27:28.180
Friehof, Fischel.

02:27:29.799 --> 02:27:31.176
Mietek Pemper.

So, there will be
no summary executions here.

Madam.
Hello.

02:47:19.905 --> 02:47:21.665
What is it? We've received
an angry complaint

02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:23.458
from the Armaments Board.

02:47:23.534 --> 02:47:25.662
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,

02:47:25.744 --> 02:47:28.293
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

02:47:28.413 --> 02:47:30.461
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.

02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:32.714
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

02:47:32.834 --> 02:47:34.677
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.

02:47:34.753 --> 02:47:36.596
Sure, so would I, so would you.

02:47:36.672 --> 02:47:39.016
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.

02:47:39.091 --> 02:47:42.891
There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:46.644
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

02:47:49.476 --> 02:47:51.649
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:52.729
Pass them off as ours.

02:47:52.854 --> 02:47:53.935
I don't see the difference.

02:47:53.981 --> 02:47:55.073
Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...

02:47:55.148 --> 02:47:56.741
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

02:47:56.817 --> 02:47:57.784
You'll lose a lot of money.

02:47:57.859 --> 02:47:59.657
Fewer shells will be made.

02:47:59.736 --> 02:48:01.534
Stern, if this factory
ever produces

02:48:01.655 --> 02:48:03.498
a shell that can
actually be fired,

02:48:03.574 --> 02:48:05.042

02:59:53.032 --> 02:59:54.659
Ten more people.

02:59:57.453 --> 02:59:59.046
This pin...

02:59:59.163 --> 03:00:00.585
Two people.

03:00:03.668 --> 03:00:05.136
This is gold.

03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:07.263
Two more people.

03:00:07.547 --> 03:00:10.551
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

03:00:10.675 --> 03:00:12.723
He would have
given me one, one more.

03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.807
One more person.

03:00:20.435 --> 03:00:22.062
A person, Stern.

03:00:24.355 --> 03:00:25.698
For this.

03:00:28.401 --> 03:00:31.450
(SOBBING) I could have gotten

03:00:32.196 --> 03:00:35.666
one more person, and I didn't.

03:00:37.243 --> 03:00:38.961
And I didn't!

03:00:39.162 --> 03:00:40.914
(LOUD SOBBING)

03:02:09.585 --> 03:02:11.804
You have been liberated

03:02:12.255 --> 03:02:14.257
by the Soviet Army!

03:02:22.890 --> 03:02:24.563
Have you been in Poland?

03:02:24.725 --> 03:02:25.977
I just came from Poland.

03:02:29.439 --> 03:02:31.191
Are there any Jews left?

03:02:37.321 --> 03:02:38.823
Where should we go?

03:02:39.699 --> 03:02:42.077
RUSSIAN OFFICER: Don't go
east, that's for sure.

03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:43.753
They hate you there.

03:02:45.538 --> 03:02:47.757
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

03:02:50.376 --> 03:02:52.344
We could use some food.

03:02:55.047 --> 03:02:57.391
Isn't there a town over there?
