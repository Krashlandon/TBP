WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
.

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:53.883
It's alive.

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:58.053
It's alive. It's alive!

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.903
There he is! Hit it again!

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:26.913
Success!

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:29.332
Count, it's just you.

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:33.252
I was beginning
to lose faith, Victor.

00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.007
A pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled...

00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:41.510
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:42.928
Yes.

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.513
I must escape this place.

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:48.683
Where are you going to run,
Victor?

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:54.855
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome...

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.358
in most of the civilized world.

00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.278
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.113
No, no, Victor.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.616
The time has come
for me to take command of him.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.534
What are you saying?

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.787
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:14.540
- Equipped your laboratory?
- You said...

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:18.210
- You said you believed in my work.
- And I do.

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:23.548
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said...

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.135
a triumph of science...

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:29.804
over God...

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.227
it must now serve my purpose.

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.231
What purpose?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.411
Good God!

00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.664
I would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:03.084
Feel free. I don't actually need you
anymore, Victor.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:05.003
I just need him.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.338
He is the key.

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:11.342
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:13.094
I could.

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:17.014
In fact,
my brides are insisting upon it.

00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:22.686
Igor, help me!

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.855
You have been
so kind to me, Doctor...

00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:28.608
caring, thoughtful.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.360
But he pays me.

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:36.699
Stay back.

00:03:36.865 --> 00:03:39.368
You can't kill me, Victor.

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:47.625
I'm already dead.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:45.845
Dr. Frankenstein!

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.851
Look, it's headed for the windmill!
Come on!

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.894
Burn it! Burn it down!

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:45.705
Vampires.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:48.291
- Run for your lives!
-Vampires!

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:11.062
Father.

00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:28.438
Evening.

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.692
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

00:09:33.943 --> 00:09:36.362
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:46.329
I missed you in London.

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:50.208
No, you bloody did not!
You got me good.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:53.210
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted
by the Knights of the Holy Order...

00:09:53.294 --> 00:09:54.503
It's Mr. Hyde now.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.506
...for the murder of 12 men,
six women, four...

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:02.469
...children, three goats, and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry!

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:06.806
So you're the great Van Helsing.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.309
And you're a deranged psychopath.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:17.441
We all have our little problems.

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:22.237
My superiors would like for me
to take you alive...

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.906
so that they may extricate
your better half.

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:27.492
I bet they bloody would.

00:10:27.867 --> 00:10:31.412
Personally, I'd rather just kill you
and call it a day.

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:34.081
But let's make it your decision,
shall we?

00:10:34.331 --> 00:10:35.624
Do let's.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.688
Here I come...

00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:02.274
ready or not!

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:07.862
The bell!

00:11:37.056 --> 00:11:38.891
No, no.

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:43.145
I'll bet that's upsetting.

00:11:54.321 --> 00:11:55.990
Paris!

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.495
Come here.

00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:08.501
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:16.675
It's been a pleasure knowing you.
Au revoir!

00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:38.278
Oh, no.

00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:47.954
My turn.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.311
May he rest in peace.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.995
Van Helsing.

00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:36.332
You murderer!

00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:04.941
Bless me, Father, for I have...

00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:07.944
Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:10.696
You shattered the Rose Window.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.532
Not to split hairs, sir,
but Mr. Hyde did the shattering.

00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:17.286
13th century. Over 600 years old.

00:14:18.704 --> 00:14:22.207
- I wish you a week in hell for that.
- It would be a nice reprieve.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.710
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable...

00:14:25.877 --> 00:14:28.963
but your methods
attract far too much attention.

00:14:29.213 --> 00:14:31.966
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:34.718
Do you think I like being
the most wanted man in Europe?

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:37.137
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:39.389
Because we do not exist.

00:14:39.723 --> 00:14:41.725
Well, then neither do I.

00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:49.065
When we found you crawling up
the steps of this church, half-dead...

00:14:49.148 --> 00:14:52.818
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do God's work.

00:14:52.902 --> 00:14:55.488
- Why can't he do it himself?
- Don't blaspheme.

00:14:55.571 --> 00:14:59.241
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

00:14:59.992 --> 00:15:01.743
If you wish to recover it...

00:15:01.827 --> 00:15:04.663
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:09.250
Without us,
the world would be in darkness.

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:12.503
Governments and empires
come and go...

00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:17.174
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:20.093
We are the last defense
against evil.

00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:23.597
An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.268
To you, these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished.

00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:32.104
I'm the one standing there
when they die...

00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:33.939
and become the men they once were.

00:15:34.023 --> 00:15:37.526
For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:41.530
And now,
we need you to go to the East.

00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:44.699
To the far side of Romania.

00:15:45.617 --> 00:15:47.118
An accursed land...

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:50.204
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:53.624
Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:56.293
- Dracula?
- Yes.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.463
You've never faced one
like this before.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.800
Our story begins 450 years ago...

00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:07.470
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.224
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

00:16:11.307 --> 00:16:14.310
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

00:16:14.894 --> 00:16:16.812
They have not succeeded...

00:16:17.479 --> 00:16:19.982
and they are running out of family.

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:25.153
His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:27.906
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.328
His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:37.998
If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

00:16:38.082 --> 00:16:40.167
nine generations of their family...

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.919
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.338
For more than four centuries...

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.174
this family has defended
our left flank.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.093
They gave their lives.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.512
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.931
So you're sending me into hell.

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.351
In a manner.

00:17:02.437 --> 00:17:06.107
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:08.693
We don't know its purpose...

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:11.362
but he would not have
left it lightly.

00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:14.031
The Latin inscription translates as:

00:17:14.698 --> 00:17:17.368
"In the name of God,
open this door."

00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:20.203
There is an insignia.

00:17:24.374 --> 00:17:26.876
Yes, it matches your ring.

00:17:27.877 --> 00:17:32.215
I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

00:17:39.304 --> 00:17:41.473
Faster, please. Faster!

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.392
Faster! Faster! Faster!

00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:47.061
Getting there.

00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:48.980
- Carl!
- There you are.

00:17:49.397 --> 00:17:52.316
Did you bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

00:17:52.316 --> 00:17:55.236
You killed him, didn't you?
That's why they get so annoyed.

00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:58.572
When they ask you to bring someone
back, they don't mean as a corpse.

00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:00.574
All right, you're in a mood.
Come on.

00:18:00.657 --> 00:18:03.326
I have some things that'll
put the bit back in your mouth.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.495
Any idiot can make a sword.

00:18:06.162 --> 00:18:07.497
Sorry, Father.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.124
- Come along, Carl.
- Here, take this:

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:14.336
Rings of garlic, holy water...

00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:19.758
silver stake, crucifix.

00:18:22.636 --> 00:18:24.846
Why can't I have one of those?

00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:27.473
You've never gone after vampires
before now, have you?

00:18:27.515 --> 00:18:29.851
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

00:18:30.017 --> 00:18:31.352
Best when cooked well.

00:18:31.435 --> 00:18:32.520
No, they're not all the same.

00:18:32.603 --> 00:18:36.106
A vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:38.192
Carl, you've never even been
out of the abbey.

00:18:38.358 --> 00:18:41.111
- How do you know about vampires?
- I read.

00:18:42.112 --> 00:18:43.947
Here's something new.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:46.491
Glycerin 48.

00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:53.789
Sorry!

00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:56.375
What in Allah's name
is wrong with you?

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:59.002
The air around here
is thick with envy.

00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:02.923
This is my latest invention.
It's gas-propelled.

00:19:02.964 --> 00:19:05.300
Capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession...

00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:09.053
at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

00:19:09.804 --> 00:19:11.889
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

00:19:11.973 --> 00:19:14.975
Trust me, you'll need this.
A work of certifiable genius.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:18.228
- Lf you don't say so yourself.
- No, I did say so myself.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.147
I'm a veritable cornucopia
of talent.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.732
Did you invent this?

00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:23.650
I've been working on that
for 12 years.

00:19:23.775 --> 00:19:25.652
It's compressed magma
from Mt. Vesuvius...

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:27.820
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

00:19:27.946 --> 00:19:30.031
- It's one of a kind.
- What's it for?

00:19:30.073 --> 00:19:32.658
I don't know,
but I'm sure it'll come in handy.

00:19:32.742 --> 00:19:34.994
Twelve years,
and you don't know what it does?

00:19:35.077 --> 00:19:37.663
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:40.165
What it does
is to create a light source...

00:19:40.249 --> 00:19:41.833
equal to the intensity of the sun.

00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:43.502
This will come in handy how?

00:19:43.585 --> 00:19:45.837
I don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.131
Charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest.

00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:49.674
Use your imagination.

00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:52.510
No, I'm gonna use yours.
That's why you're coming with me.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:55.095
- Holy hell be damned I am!
- You cursed.

00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:56.847
Not very well, but you're a monk.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.265
You shouldn't curse at all.

00:19:58.348 --> 00:20:01.935
Actually, I'm still just a friar.
I can curse all I want...

00:20:02.018 --> 00:20:03.186
damn it!

00:20:03.395 --> 00:20:06.356
The Cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive.

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:10.359
- For as long as possible.
- But I'm not a field man.

00:20:12.236 --> 00:20:14.447
I don't want to go to Transylvania.

00:20:55.484 --> 00:20:56.652
Come on.

00:20:56.944 --> 00:21:00.155
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.970
Pull me up!

00:21:25.011 --> 00:21:26.429
It's stuck!

00:21:34.854 --> 00:21:38.107
- No, Anna, it will kill you!
- That's my brother out there.

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:43.028
Cut the rope! Cut it now!

00:21:56.874 --> 00:21:58.042
Velkan!

00:22:08.968 --> 00:22:10.845
My gun! Find my gun!

00:22:10.887 --> 00:22:13.723
Find Velkan's gun.
It has to be the silver bullets.

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:18.393
Anna, hurry!

00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:19.895
Hurry!

00:22:22.564 --> 00:22:23.648
Move.

00:22:25.483 --> 00:22:27.068
Anna, look out!

00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:30.655
Run!

00:23:00.766 --> 00:23:02.100
Velkan.

00:23:07.272 --> 00:23:08.439
God...

00:23:10.525 --> 00:23:11.776
help us.

00:24:23.675 --> 00:24:26.511
- So, what do you remember?
- Not now, Carl.

00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:28.763
There must be something.

00:24:29.263 --> 00:24:32.016
I remember fighting the Romans
at Masada.

00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:35.019
- That was in 73 A.D.
- You asked.

00:24:37.938 --> 00:24:39.523
What are we doing here?

00:24:39.606 --> 00:24:41.942
Why is it so important
to kill this Dracula, anyway?

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:45.028
- Because he's the son of the Devil.
- I mean, besides that.

00:24:45.111 --> 00:24:48.197
If we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

00:24:48.281 --> 00:24:49.532
I mean, besides that.

00:24:49.615 --> 00:24:52.368
Welcome to Transylvania.

00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:06.714
- Is it always like this?
- Pretty much.

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:09.884
You, turn around.

00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:15.973
- Let me see your faces.
- Why?

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.308
Because we don't trust strangers.

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:20.727
Strangers don't last long here.

00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:23.396
5'7" by 2'3".

00:25:25.231 --> 00:25:27.817
Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.

00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:30.236
You can try.

00:25:34.156 --> 00:25:36.325
You refuse to obey our laws?

00:25:36.492 --> 00:25:39.661
- The laws of men mean little to me.
- Fine.

00:25:40.329 --> 00:25:41.413
Kill them.

00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:44.332
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't need any help.

00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:45.667
Really?

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:04.434
Everybody inside!

00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:06.603
Hide the children!

00:26:34.128 --> 00:26:35.546
Stay here.

00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:38.632
You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

00:26:44.304 --> 00:26:47.974
- Marishka, kill the stranger.
- Love to.

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:54.980
Run!

00:27:04.906 --> 00:27:06.908
Carl, it's not working.

00:27:07.742 --> 00:27:09.827
Try aiming at their hearts.

00:27:51.115 --> 00:27:52.533
It's the sun.

00:28:54.256 --> 00:28:55.508
Van Helsing.

00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:03.515
Do you like to fly, Anna?

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:00.984
Hello, Anna.

00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:08.408
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

00:30:52.782 --> 00:30:55.034
Did I do something to you
in a past life?

00:30:55.284 --> 00:30:57.453
Don't play coy with me, Princess.

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:04.542
I know what lurks
in your lusting heart.

00:31:04.793 --> 00:31:07.295
I hope you have a heart, Aleera...

00:31:07.378 --> 00:31:10.381
because someday I'm going to drive
a stake through it.

00:31:21.308 --> 00:31:23.310
This should do the trick.

00:31:24.477 --> 00:31:25.979
Holy water!

00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:35.738
Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:41.910
Too bad. So sad.

00:31:42.577 --> 00:31:43.995
The church!

00:31:55.923 --> 00:31:57.841
Thirty years old.

00:31:58.258 --> 00:31:59.927
Perfectly aged.

00:32:00.677 --> 00:32:02.846
Hello, Anna, my dear.

00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:16.859
The last of the Valerious.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.894
I can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins.

00:32:56.562 --> 00:32:58.063
Here she comes!

00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.153
I want first bite.

00:34:25.143 --> 00:34:28.062
- He killed a bride!
- He killed Marishka!

00:34:32.483 --> 00:34:34.568
You killed Marishka!

00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:38.155
- You killed a vampire!
- But isn't that a good thing?

00:34:38.238 --> 00:34:41.158
Vampires only kill what they need
to survive.

00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:43.326
One or two people a month.

00:34:43.827 --> 00:34:46.830
Now they will kill for revenge.

00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.669
- Are you always this popular?
- Pretty much.

00:34:53.836 --> 00:34:58.257
So what name, my good sir,
do I carve on your gravestone?

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.509
His name is Van Helsing.

00:35:07.182 --> 00:35:09.434
Your reputation precedes you.

00:35:14.688 --> 00:35:17.775
Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:21.695
Well, I'll say this for you.
You've got courage.

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:25.532
He's the first one to kill a vampire
in over 100 years.

00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:28.368
I'd say that's earned him a drink.

00:35:33.873 --> 00:35:36.709
Marishka!

00:35:44.966 --> 00:35:47.427
Why can't they just
leave us alone?

00:35:47.468 --> 00:35:51.847
We never kill more than our fill
and less than our share.

00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:53.808
Can they say the same?

00:35:54.642 --> 00:35:57.227
Did I not stress
how important it was...

00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:59.938
to be finished
with Anna Valerious...

00:36:00.188 --> 00:36:03.733
before she destroys
what we are trying to create?

00:36:03.817 --> 00:36:06.945
- We lost Marishka.
- Master.

00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:10.615
There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

00:36:10.865 --> 00:36:13.492
- I shall find another bride.
- What?

00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:19.081
- Do we mean so little to you?
- Have you no heart?

00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:23.585
No, I have no heart! I feel no love!

00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:25.712
Nor fear...

00:36:26.838 --> 00:36:28.339
nor joy...

00:36:29.757 --> 00:36:31.217
nor sorrow!

00:36:33.094 --> 00:36:35.638
I am hollow.

00:36:39.266 --> 00:36:42.769
And I will live forever.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.564
- My Lord.
- It is not so bad.

00:36:49.692 --> 00:36:51.944
I am at war with the world...

00:36:52.278 --> 00:36:55.197
and every living soul in it.

00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:59.034
But soon
the final battle will begin.

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:01.286
I must go and find out
who our new visitor is.

00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:10.044
You will have to make
a little apéritif out of him.

00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:13.672
We are much too close to success
to be interrupted now.

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:17.468
- No!
- The last experiment was a failure!

00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:21.638
Please, say you will not try again.

00:37:21.888 --> 00:37:26.392
My heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.653
Come.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.490
Do not fear me.

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:44.075
Everybody else fears me.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.828
Not my brides.

00:37:50.998 --> 00:37:52.083
lgor.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.169
Yes, master.

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:58.505
Why do you torment that thing so?

00:37:59.256 --> 00:38:00.757
It's what I do.

00:38:01.008 --> 00:38:03.593
Remember, lgor, "Do unto others..."

00:38:03.718 --> 00:38:07.889
Before they do unto me, master.

00:38:08.348 --> 00:38:11.100
Now go, all of you!

00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:14.019
To Castle Frankenstein!

00:38:15.604 --> 00:38:19.024
Yes, we will try again.

00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:25.613
- So, how did you get here?
- We came by sea.

00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:27.615
- Really? The sea?
- Well, yes.

00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:30.451
- The Adriatic Sea?
- Where do I find Dracula?

00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:34.038
- He used to live in this very house
four centuries ago.

00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.040
No one knows where he lives now.

00:38:36.123 --> 00:38:38.208
Father would stare at that painting
for hours...

00:38:38.292 --> 00:38:40.043
Iooking for Dracula's lair.

00:38:40.127 --> 00:38:43.046
- So that's why you've come?
- I can help you.

00:38:43.797 --> 00:38:46.049
- No one can help me.
- I can try.

00:38:46.132 --> 00:38:49.093
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:52.138
- I can handle this myself.
- So I noticed.

00:38:52.221 --> 00:38:54.807
The vampires attacked in daylight.
They never do that.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.309
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

00:38:57.393 --> 00:38:59.144
So why did they attack in daylight?

00:38:59.269 --> 00:39:01.563
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.940
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:07.402
- Why is that? Why now?
- You ask a lot of questions.

00:39:07.485 --> 00:39:08.903
Usually I ask only two:

00:39:08.987 --> 00:39:10.822
What are we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

00:39:10.905 --> 00:39:14.617
My father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year.

00:39:14.617 --> 00:39:17.745
Tearing through the tower,
combing through the family archives.

00:39:17.745 --> 00:39:20.122
- Carl, the tower. Start there.
- Right.

00:39:20.247 --> 00:39:23.667
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.337
And who will kill him if not me?
Who will show courage if not me?

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.922
Go alone and you'll be outmanned
and outpositioned.

00:39:30.006 --> 00:39:31.924
And you can't see in the dark.

00:39:32.008 --> 00:39:34.510
In the morning, we will hunt him...

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:37.262
but we'll do it together.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.271
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

00:39:46.771 --> 00:39:50.441
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

00:39:53.986 --> 00:39:56.113
It's a bit of both, I think.

00:39:59.449 --> 00:40:02.577
- I promised you a drink.
- Yes, you did.

00:40:03.453 --> 00:40:06.122
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

00:40:06.247 --> 00:40:09.542
As for me, I'm going to finish this
once and for all.

00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:12.128
Sorry you've to carry
this burden alone.

00:40:12.211 --> 00:40:14.547
On the contrary,
I would wish for it no other way.

00:40:14.588 --> 00:40:16.298
I'm sorry about your father
and brother.

00:40:16.423 --> 00:40:17.800
I will see them again.

00:40:17.883 --> 00:40:20.844
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:25.223
- There's a brighter side of death?
- Yes. It's just harder to see.

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.231
I'm sorry about that, too.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.828
Van Helsing!

00:40:59.755 --> 00:41:01.173
Van Helsing?

00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:29.017
- Velkan?
- Anna.

00:43:29.892 --> 00:43:31.894
Oh, my God, you're alive.

00:43:33.896 --> 00:43:35.648
No. Anna, I only have a moment.

00:43:35.731 --> 00:43:38.066
- But there's a werewolf...
- Listen to me!

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.569
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a...

00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:47.784
- Velkan?
- Please.

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.828
No!

00:44:17.936 --> 00:44:19.771
Run, Anna.

00:44:38.622 --> 00:44:39.706
Anna!

00:44:45.628 --> 00:44:46.713
Are you all right?

00:44:46.796 --> 00:44:47.880
Anna!

00:45:03.144 --> 00:45:05.647
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.815
Werewolf!

00:45:06.898 --> 00:45:08.900
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

00:45:08.983 --> 00:45:10.318
Well done.

00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:00.864
Who's hunting whom?

00:46:09.705 --> 00:46:13.376
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

00:46:13.626 --> 00:46:17.546
But for you it's a perfect fit.

00:46:18.964 --> 00:46:20.716
What a coincidence.

00:46:21.633 --> 00:46:23.885
I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:25.887
Don't worry, he's getting to it.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.472
You don't seem bothered.

00:46:27.555 --> 00:46:29.057
I'm no threat to him.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.059
I'm just the one
who cleans up after him...

00:46:32.393 --> 00:46:34.061
if you get my meaning.

00:46:34.145 --> 00:46:36.230
Little late to be digging graves,
isn't it?

00:46:36.313 --> 00:46:38.565
Never too late to dig graves.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.570
You never know
when you'll need a fresh one.

00:46:46.072 --> 00:46:50.493
Oh, sorry. It's just my nature.

00:47:06.092 --> 00:47:07.510
- Move!
- No!

00:47:11.681 --> 00:47:14.600
- Why?
- You're choking me!

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.688
- Give me a reason not to.
- I can't. If people knew...

00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:25.527
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!

00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:29.530
- You knew?
- Yes.

00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:34.201
Before or after I stopped you
from shooting him?

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:35.286
Before.

00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:36.871
And still you tried to kill him!

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.789
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

00:47:38.872 --> 00:47:40.374
He can't help it!
It's not his fault!

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:41.792
I know, but he'll do it anyway!

00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:44.127
Do you understand forgiveness?

00:47:44.377 --> 00:47:46.796
Yes. I ask for it often.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.217
They say Dracula has a cure.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.302
If there's a chance
I can save my brother...

00:47:53.386 --> 00:47:54.553
- I'm going after it.
- No.

00:47:54.637 --> 00:47:57.473
- I need to find Dracula.
- And I need to find my brother!

00:47:57.556 --> 00:48:01.226
He gave his life for me.
He's the only family I have left.

00:48:02.311 --> 00:48:05.564
I despise Dracula
more than you can ever imagine.

00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:09.984
He has taken everything from me,
leaving me alone in this world.

00:48:24.998 --> 00:48:28.084
To have memories
of those you loved and lost...

00:48:28.668 --> 00:48:31.921
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.424
All right.

00:48:37.676 --> 00:48:39.678
We'll look for your brother.

00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:11.290
- Igor.
- Yes, master.

00:49:11.374 --> 00:49:14.877
- How long before we are ready?
- Soon, master. Very soon.

00:49:16.378 --> 00:49:18.714
It is difficult
without the good doctor...

00:49:18.797 --> 00:49:21.133
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:23.385
No!

00:49:24.719 --> 00:49:25.887
Good.

00:49:28.723 --> 00:49:32.560
For me, this is all personal.
It's all about family and honour.

00:49:33.227 --> 00:49:36.981
Why do you do it, this job of yours?
What do you hope to get out of it?

00:49:37.064 --> 00:49:39.900
I don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

00:49:40.651 --> 00:49:43.153
What have you got out of it so far?

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.405
Nightmares.

00:49:47.991 --> 00:49:50.910
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

00:49:50.993 --> 00:49:53.079
Before the curse
has completely consumed them.

00:50:04.256 --> 00:50:07.092
- What is this place?
- Castle Frankenstein.

00:50:07.592 --> 00:50:09.427
But it should be abandoned.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.678
I don't understand.

00:50:10.762 --> 00:50:13.181
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

00:50:13.264 --> 00:50:15.850
- A grave robber, among other things.
- A year ago.

00:50:15.933 --> 00:50:18.435
It was just after that
that your father went missing.

00:50:18.519 --> 00:50:22.356
Yes. He was looking for Dracula.
He was on his way to the sea.

00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:25.775
I have never been to the sea.

00:50:31.114 --> 00:50:33.115
I'll bet it's beautiful.

00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:54.802
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.805
So hard to control.

00:51:21.577 --> 00:51:23.662
I send you on a simple errand...

00:51:23.745 --> 00:51:26.247
to find out
who our new visitor is...

00:51:26.831 --> 00:51:30.335
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister.

00:51:30.418 --> 00:51:34.171
Leave her out of this, Count.
She doesn't know your secret.

00:51:34.422 --> 00:51:36.841
And I am soon to take it
to my grave.

00:51:37.841 --> 00:51:41.678
Don't wish for death so quickly.
I intend for you to be quite useful.

00:51:41.762 --> 00:51:43.513
I would rather die than help you.

00:51:43.597 --> 00:51:46.683
Don't be boring.
Everyone who says that dies.

00:51:46.766 --> 00:51:48.351
Besides, tonight...

00:51:48.434 --> 00:51:50.353
after the final stroke
of midnight...

00:51:50.436 --> 00:51:53.022
you will have no choice
but to obey me.

00:51:55.524 --> 00:51:57.026
Look familiar?

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:02.781
Father?

00:52:03.532 --> 00:52:05.283
No!

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.785
He proved useless.

00:52:06.868 --> 00:52:10.121
But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom
running through your veins...

00:52:10.204 --> 00:52:12.206
you will be of greater benefit!

00:52:16.377 --> 00:52:20.214
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

00:52:25.552 --> 00:52:28.805
Never!

00:52:46.655 --> 00:52:48.656
- Dwergi.
- Dwergi?

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.160
Dracula's servants.
Industrious but extremely vicious.

00:52:52.243 --> 00:52:54.245
If you get the chance to kill one,
do it...

00:52:54.328 --> 00:52:57.081
- Because they'll do worse to you.
- Right.

00:53:02.419 --> 00:53:05.338
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

00:53:05.422 --> 00:53:07.841
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

00:53:07.924 --> 00:53:09.926
- There's still hope.
- Anna.

00:53:10.593 --> 00:53:13.095
There is no hope for your brother.

00:53:13.262 --> 00:53:16.599
But we can still protect others
by killing Dracula.

00:53:23.688 --> 00:53:25.273
Let us begin!

00:53:34.448 --> 00:53:37.534
"No slacking! Up! "

00:53:52.465 --> 00:53:54.633
- You ever see these things?
- No.

00:53:54.717 --> 00:53:57.386
- What do you think they are?
- Offspring.

00:53:57.469 --> 00:53:58.554
- What?

00:53:58.637 --> 00:54:01.056
A man with three
gorgeous women for 400 years.

00:54:01.139 --> 00:54:03.308
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.

00:54:03.392 --> 00:54:05.894
It only makes sense
their children are born dead.

00:54:05.977 --> 00:54:08.897
He's obviously trying
to bring them to life.

00:54:13.234 --> 00:54:15.069
Ladies first.

00:54:40.175 --> 00:54:43.929
Dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month.

00:54:44.346 --> 00:54:47.098
If he brings
all these things to life...

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:06.449
- Throw the switches!
- Yes, master.

00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:43.650
What are you doing?

00:55:43.733 --> 00:55:45.902
I want to see what we're up against.

00:56:16.597 --> 00:56:19.433
So this is what you get
when vampires mate.

00:56:41.703 --> 00:56:42.871
Come on!

00:57:14.483 --> 00:57:18.904
They need to feed.
Teach them how. Teach them!

00:57:27.579 --> 00:57:29.330
And beg the Devil...

00:57:30.832 --> 00:57:33.251
that this time they stay alive.

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:45.512
- This is where I come in.
- No, wait!

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:58.524
Now that I have your attention...

00:58:22.379 --> 00:58:24.631
Yes, well, that's interesting.

00:58:33.222 --> 00:58:36.642
That's not good. Must warn somebody.

00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:54.408
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

00:58:55.493 --> 00:58:58.412
Usually when I approach...

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:03.333
I can almost dance to the beat.

00:59:05.502 --> 00:59:09.339
Strange that yours is so steady.

00:59:18.013 --> 00:59:19.515
"Hurry up! "

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.936
We must keep the
atmosphere electrified!

00:59:26.688 --> 00:59:28.857
Accelerate the generators!

00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:31.692
Power the dynamos!

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.695
We are losing power.

00:59:35.696 --> 00:59:37.781
The human is insufficient.

00:59:43.537 --> 00:59:44.704
Velkan.

00:59:57.883 --> 00:59:59.468
Oh, my God.

01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:34.834
Feed, my darlings! Feed!

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.522
May he rest in peace.

01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:03.026
Hello, Gabriel.

01:02:01.246 --> 01:02:04.833
We must not lose
the master's progeny!

01:02:07.919 --> 01:02:10.171
Is this your silver stake?

01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:18.095
How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.185
You don't remember, do you?

01:02:26.853 --> 01:02:27.896
Exactly what is it
I should be remembering?

01:02:29.147 --> 01:02:31.357
You are the great Van Helsing.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.735
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to Istanbul.

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:40.449
Protected by Rome herself.

01:02:41.116 --> 01:02:44.619
But, like me, hunted by all others.

01:02:44.703 --> 01:02:46.955
The Knights of the Holy Order
know all about you.

01:02:47.038 --> 01:02:48.957
It's no surprise
you would know about me.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.042
Yes, but it's much more than this.

01:02:55.713 --> 01:03:00.467
We have such history,
you and I, Gabriel.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:08.892
Have you ever wondered why
you have such horrible nightmares?

01:03:10.143 --> 01:03:13.646
Horrific scenes
of ancient battles past.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:19.902
How do you know me?

01:03:27.575 --> 01:03:30.578
- Velkan.
- Anna.

01:03:30.662 --> 01:03:32.413
No. Don't unstrap me.

01:03:32.497 --> 01:03:33.664
Don't unstrap me!

01:03:33.748 --> 01:03:36.584
No, you must not! No! Stop!

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:38.252
Stop it.
I'm getting you out of here.

01:03:38.335 --> 01:03:40.921
Velkan, it's all right.
I'm taking you home.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.681
So would you like me
to refresh your memory a little?

01:03:52.932 --> 01:03:55.851
A few details from your sordid past.

01:04:05.777 --> 01:04:08.947
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:14.785
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

01:04:15.453 --> 01:04:20.374
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.878
Born 1422.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:29.549
Murdered 1462.

01:04:42.978 --> 01:04:44.813
Help me!

01:05:33.024 --> 01:05:35.609
I think
we've overstayed our welcome.

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:24.738
- Have you found the children?
- Not yet.

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:31.494
- What happened?
- They just died.

01:06:36.499 --> 01:06:38.584
How can I ever repay you?

01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.676
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.095
Well, actually I'm just a friar.

01:06:54.015 --> 01:06:57.518
I am sorry, master.
We try and we try...

01:06:57.601 --> 01:07:02.105
but I fear we are not so smart
as Dr. Frankenstein.

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:03.940
Truly.

01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:09.112
It would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:15.951
Hunt them down.

01:07:18.537 --> 01:07:20.122
Kill them both.

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:25.543
A silver stake? A crucifix?

01:07:25.794 --> 01:07:28.546
What, did you think we
haven't tried everything before?

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:31.215
We've shot him, stabbed him,
clubbed him...

01:07:31.299 --> 01:07:34.051
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart...

01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:35.886
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.972
No one knows how to kill Dracula.

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:41.642
Well, I could have used
that information a little earlier.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.977
Don't give me that look.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.234
You were right. I'm sorry.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.236
He's not my brother anymore.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.669
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:16.006
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.175
That's what keeps me going.

01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:23.263
- Here's to what keeps you going.
- Absinthe. Strong stuff.

01:08:27.434 --> 01:08:30.186
Don't let it touch your tongue.
It'll knock you on your...

01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:52.290
Vampire.

01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:56.627
Vampires!

01:09:03.967 --> 01:09:05.635
Now I remember.

01:09:17.313 --> 01:09:21.984
"Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

01:09:22.734 --> 01:09:27.072
"May become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms

01:09:27.822 --> 01:09:30.074
"And the moon is shining bright

01:09:30.742 --> 01:09:33.828
"Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down

01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:36.163
"And his body takes to flight"

01:10:16.082 --> 01:10:18.251
There's something down here.

01:10:20.587 --> 01:10:22.505
And it's carnivorous.

01:10:25.675 --> 01:10:28.844
Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:37.769
I'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

01:10:38.603 --> 01:10:40.772
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

01:10:41.522 --> 01:10:45.860
He has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth.

01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:48.112
How do you know he has copper teeth?

01:10:48.195 --> 01:10:50.697
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.289
Oh, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

01:10:59.372 --> 01:11:02.542
Monster? Who's the monster here?

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.295
I have done nothing wrong...

01:11:06.378 --> 01:11:09.548
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead!

01:11:31.318 --> 01:11:32.986
What do you want?

01:11:34.738 --> 01:11:36.489
To exist.

01:11:49.168 --> 01:11:50.294
Don't!

01:11:50.586 --> 01:11:52.004
- We must kill it.
- Wait.

01:11:52.087 --> 01:11:55.507
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind...

01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:58.510
- You will kill me.
- No.

01:11:59.427 --> 01:12:01.346
If Dracula finds me...

01:12:03.598 --> 01:12:06.976
I am the key to my father's machine.

01:12:08.185 --> 01:12:09.853
The key to life.

01:12:10.646 --> 01:12:13.523
Life for Dracula's children.

01:12:13.607 --> 01:12:15.192
He already awakened them last night.

01:12:15.317 --> 01:12:16.443
Two.

01:12:16.901 --> 01:12:20.029
And those were from only one bride.

01:12:21.447 --> 01:12:24.158
From one single birthing.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.828
And they died
as they did the last time he tried.

01:12:31.039 --> 01:12:35.961
Only with me
can he give them lasting life.

01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:38.713
There are more?
More of those things?

01:12:39.839 --> 01:12:41.132
Thousands.

01:12:42.717 --> 01:12:44.218
Thousands more.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.899
- No.
- You heard what he said.

01:12:59.899 --> 01:13:03.069
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.

01:13:03.152 --> 01:13:04.820
I can sense evil.

01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:07.239
This thing, man, whatever it is...

01:13:07.239 --> 01:13:09.825
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:12.911
But evil does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.

01:13:13.328 --> 01:13:15.497
- I can.
- Not while I'm here.

01:13:19.459 --> 01:13:20.501
Anna.

01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:23.754
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:26.924
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

01:13:36.099 --> 01:13:38.726
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

01:13:39.435 --> 01:13:40.853
Now they'll come for him.

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.897
Neither you nor I
will be able to stop them.

01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:46.275
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

01:13:46.358 --> 01:13:47.860
And then the painting came alive...

01:13:47.943 --> 01:13:49.737
and the two creatures
attacked each other.

01:13:49.862 --> 01:13:51.738
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.616
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

01:13:56.368 --> 01:13:58.078
I'm staring at him.

01:13:58.536 --> 01:13:59.954
Is that a man?

01:14:00.079 --> 01:14:02.206
Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:04.875
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:06.877
Me and all of humanity!

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:09.463
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

01:14:09.505 --> 01:14:11.298
Not even a werewolf.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:13.967
Anything else, you're on your own.

01:14:28.147 --> 01:14:30.858
- Let me go.
- Where are you going to go?

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.818
I don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...

01:14:32.943 --> 01:14:34.528
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:56.533
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!

01:17:03.372 --> 01:17:05.958
Save him! Save the monster!

01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:27.978
Stakes!

01:17:38.405 --> 01:17:40.114
No!

01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:01.968
Oh, my God.

01:18:09.808 --> 01:18:11.685
What are you doing out here?

01:18:11.768 --> 01:18:13.020
Right.

01:18:13.437 --> 01:18:15.021
Don't let go!

01:18:28.284 --> 01:18:29.660
I can help!

01:18:29.785 --> 01:18:31.203
You won't kill me?

01:18:31.286 --> 01:18:33.288
Only if you don't hurry!

01:19:17.412 --> 01:19:18.496
Jump!

01:19:56.531 --> 01:19:57.615
Velkan.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.287
Velkan.

01:20:05.289 --> 01:20:06.457
Anna...

01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:15.507
forgive me.

01:20:24.056 --> 01:20:25.891
I will see you again.

01:20:37.152 --> 01:20:38.736
You killed him.

01:20:40.738 --> 01:20:43.324
Now you know
why they call me murderer.

01:20:51.456 --> 01:20:52.833
Oh, my God.

01:20:54.668 --> 01:20:56.419
You've been bitten.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:11.934
Anna!

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.363
Anna.

01:21:50.302 --> 01:21:54.514
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.

01:21:54.806 --> 01:21:56.057
What do you want?

01:21:56.308 --> 01:21:58.560
The master commands a trade.

01:22:00.561 --> 01:22:04.732
The monster for the Princess.

01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:07.526
Somewhere public. Lots of people.

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:12.281
A place where your master
will be less inclined...

01:22:12.406 --> 01:22:14.408
to expose his other side.

01:22:16.993 --> 01:22:19.829
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.

01:22:20.496 --> 01:22:25.251
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

01:22:36.428 --> 01:22:38.096
- Are you all right?
- No.

01:22:41.516 --> 01:22:42.975
He has been bitten.

01:22:43.017 --> 01:22:44.852
Bitten by a werewolf.

01:22:46.187 --> 01:22:50.107
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

01:22:57.864 --> 01:22:59.282
I am sorry.

01:23:00.158 --> 01:23:03.703
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:11.168
Well, they won't find him in here.

01:23:11.543 --> 01:23:13.128
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.

01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:15.881
God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.

01:23:15.964 --> 01:23:17.465
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

01:23:17.632 --> 01:23:19.300
- Carl, help me!
- Right.

01:23:19.384 --> 01:23:22.136
How many commandments
can we break in one day?

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.180
Anyway, according to the book...

01:23:24.305 --> 01:23:27.808
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

01:23:27.808 --> 01:23:29.226
That's two nights from now.

01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:32.312
You'll still be able to
fight Dracula's hold over you...

01:23:32.396 --> 01:23:33.814
until the final stroke of midnight.

01:23:33.897 --> 01:23:35.690
So I have nothing to worry about.

01:23:35.815 --> 01:23:37.192
My God, you should be terrified.

01:23:37.233 --> 01:23:38.568
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:41.154
We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

01:23:41.863 --> 01:23:43.447
You sure he can't get out of there?

01:23:43.447 --> 01:23:45.908
Not without some help from the dead.

01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:14.322
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?

01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:16.908
I won't let you trade me, Count.

01:25:17.325 --> 01:25:19.869
I have no intention of trading you.

01:25:20.078 --> 01:25:23.039
And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do...

01:25:23.164 --> 01:25:25.666
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

01:25:27.334 --> 01:25:30.087
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.

01:25:36.593 --> 01:25:38.136
There they are.

01:25:38.178 --> 01:25:40.096
You make my skin crawl.

01:25:41.305 --> 01:25:46.018
This is not all I could do
with your skin.

01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:58.279
Carl, I need you to do something.

01:25:58.363 --> 01:26:00.281
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:07.121
Don't we make a lovely couple?

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:08.956
Oh, my God.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.291
I am looking for a new bride, Anna.

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:15.545
Someone strong and beautiful.

01:26:27.139 --> 01:26:29.475
One brief moment of pain...

01:26:31.143 --> 01:26:33.228
and we can be together forever.

01:26:41.402 --> 01:26:43.487
You have no heartbeat.

01:26:45.573 --> 01:26:48.325
Perhaps it just needs...

01:26:49.159 --> 01:26:50.994
to be rekindled.

01:27:16.268 --> 01:27:17.852
Anna. Anna!

01:27:18.019 --> 01:27:19.270
Wake up.

01:27:20.021 --> 01:27:21.356
Gabriel.

01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:32.032
Oh, Gabriel.

01:27:35.118 --> 01:27:37.370
Welcome to my summer palace.

01:27:39.956 --> 01:27:42.792
Master! Look, master!

01:27:44.377 --> 01:27:46.629
We have him, master.

01:27:46.796 --> 01:27:48.130
We have him!

01:27:49.882 --> 01:27:52.301
You wretched undead...

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:54.719
I shall have my revenge!

01:27:55.262 --> 01:27:58.640
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:01.642
"I shall fear no evil."

01:28:01.726 --> 01:28:04.729
You are nothing but damned bones...

01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:07.148
and damned souls...

01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:11.568
and will burn in the flames of Hell!

01:28:17.115 --> 01:28:20.785
Now that everything
is as it should be...

01:28:22.328 --> 01:28:26.165
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.918
Van Helsing!

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:36.341
Come on.

01:28:39.427 --> 01:28:41.429
Yes!

01:28:47.393 --> 01:28:50.104
Now I know what it's for.

01:28:50.771 --> 01:28:53.273
- Where are we going?
- Through that window!

01:29:11.206 --> 01:29:13.125
Carl, you're a genius!

01:29:13.792 --> 01:29:16.586
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

01:29:28.305 --> 01:29:30.641
Say goodbye to your friends.

01:29:50.659 --> 01:29:53.578
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

01:29:53.578 --> 01:29:55.163
I swear to God!

01:30:02.962 --> 01:30:05.089
- I must save him.
- No, you can't.

01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:06.340
Why?

01:30:06.424 --> 01:30:09.009
I cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.

01:30:09.009 --> 01:30:10.094
What did they say?

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.678
Even if you kill Dracula...

01:30:11.803 --> 01:30:14.764
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

01:30:14.848 --> 01:30:15.932
He isn't evil.

01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:17.600
But they say he isn't human, either.

01:30:17.767 --> 01:30:20.687
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?

01:30:20.728 --> 01:30:24.023
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

01:30:24.106 --> 01:30:26.400
What of me? Did you tell them
what I'm to become?

01:30:26.442 --> 01:30:28.277
Did they tell you how to kill me?

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.946
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?

01:30:31.029 --> 01:30:33.615
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?

01:30:34.241 --> 01:30:36.534
- Stop!
- No, I left you out!

01:30:55.093 --> 01:30:56.469
I'm sorry.

01:31:01.391 --> 01:31:02.934
It's starting.

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:21.242
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.

01:31:21.492 --> 01:31:23.244
Wherever that is.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.750
Look, there's still time.

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:32.753
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

01:31:32.836 --> 01:31:34.004
The sun sets in two hours.

01:31:34.087 --> 01:31:36.589
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

01:31:36.673 --> 01:31:40.343
Yes, well, I wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was I?

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.929
Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

01:31:43.012 --> 01:31:46.182
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:47.600
The son of your ancestor.

01:31:47.683 --> 01:31:49.601
Everybody knows that. What else?

01:31:49.768 --> 01:31:53.188
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:55.273
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

01:31:55.357 --> 01:31:56.941
Do you know who murdered him?

01:31:57.025 --> 01:32:00.111
No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

01:32:00.194 --> 01:32:03.698
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

01:32:03.781 --> 01:32:07.034
- He made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

01:32:07.117 --> 01:32:10.120
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

01:32:10.204 --> 01:32:12.372
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

01:32:12.456 --> 01:32:13.540
Sorry.

01:32:13.623 --> 01:32:16.626
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:20.964
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

01:32:21.047 --> 01:32:22.298
He was to kill Dracula...

01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:25.885
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

01:32:26.135 --> 01:32:28.304
right down the line
all the way to you.

01:32:28.387 --> 01:32:30.055
But he couldn't do it.

01:32:30.139 --> 01:32:33.141
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

01:32:33.225 --> 01:32:36.478
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

01:32:36.561 --> 01:32:39.314
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

01:32:39.397 --> 01:32:41.232
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

01:32:41.315 --> 01:32:44.485
- All right, so where is this door?
- I don't know.

01:32:45.653 --> 01:32:48.989
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

01:32:50.657 --> 01:32:53.327
So that future generations
might do it for him.

01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:55.745
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

01:32:55.829 --> 01:32:57.914
Clues to the door's location.

01:32:58.081 --> 01:32:59.415
The door.

01:33:02.001 --> 01:33:03.169
Of course.

01:33:04.086 --> 01:33:05.588
You said your father spent hours...

01:33:05.671 --> 01:33:07.923
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.

01:33:08.007 --> 01:33:09.842
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

01:33:09.925 --> 01:33:13.095
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

01:33:13.178 --> 01:33:14.930
Look. A Latin inscription.

01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:17.265
Maybe it works like
the painting in the tower.

01:33:17.349 --> 01:33:21.102
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

01:33:21.436 --> 01:33:25.022
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

01:33:30.861 --> 01:33:33.530
- Your father didn't have this.
- Where did you get that?

01:33:33.613 --> 01:33:35.198
Carl, finish it.

01:33:42.622 --> 01:33:45.374
In the name of God, open this door.

01:33:57.635 --> 01:33:58.887
A mirror.

01:33:59.387 --> 01:34:01.973
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

01:34:02.056 --> 01:34:03.307
But why?

01:34:05.976 --> 01:34:08.896
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:33.335
It's cold. And it's snowing.

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:40.591
See you on the other side.

01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:45.179
Be careful.

01:35:27.134 --> 01:35:28.552
Castle Dracula.

01:36:19.682 --> 01:36:20.850
Do we have a plan?

01:36:20.933 --> 01:36:23.352
Doesn't have to be Wellington's at Waterloo...

01:36:23.436 --> 01:36:24.687
but some sort of plan would be nice.

01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:26.439
We're going to stop Dracula.

01:36:26.522 --> 01:36:27.940
And kill anything in our way.

01:36:28.023 --> 01:36:30.109
Well, you let me know how that goes.

01:36:41.369 --> 01:36:43.704
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold...

01:36:43.788 --> 01:36:45.956
that doesn't seem like a good thing.

01:36:51.378 --> 01:36:53.296
We'd better get moving.

01:37:05.641 --> 01:37:07.560
- So are all of those...
- Yes.

01:37:07.643 --> 01:37:09.812
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

01:37:09.895 --> 01:37:12.814
Igor do this! Lgor do that!

01:37:15.233 --> 01:37:17.902
How did you find...
It's impossible!

01:37:22.907 --> 01:37:25.242
- Please don't kill me!
- Why not?

01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:27.995
Well, I...

01:37:38.755 --> 01:37:41.007
My master has awakened.

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:04.445
- There is a cure.
- What?

01:38:04.695 --> 01:38:08.866
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

01:38:10.033 --> 01:38:14.454
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!

01:38:25.798 --> 01:38:27.633
Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

01:38:27.716 --> 01:38:29.551
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?

01:38:29.635 --> 01:38:31.887
- I don't care!
- I do.

01:38:32.471 --> 01:38:34.973
Why does he need one? Why?

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.561
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.

01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:41.229
The painting. That's what it meant.

01:38:41.312 --> 01:38:44.482
Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

01:38:44.565 --> 01:38:47.818
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...

01:38:47.902 --> 01:38:51.071
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.

01:38:52.322 --> 01:38:53.740
You're going to take these two...

01:38:53.824 --> 01:38:56.409
- And lead them to the antidote.
- No, I'm not.

01:38:57.494 --> 01:38:58.912
Yes, I am.

01:38:59.412 --> 01:39:02.081
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...

01:39:02.165 --> 01:39:03.499
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

01:39:03.583 --> 01:39:05.001
We just need to find the cure...

01:39:05.084 --> 01:39:06.919
and get it into you
before the final stroke.

01:39:07.002 --> 01:39:08.754
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

01:39:08.837 --> 01:39:11.590
If they even suspect you
of misleading them...

01:39:11.673 --> 01:39:13.175
clip off one of his fingers.

01:39:13.258 --> 01:39:15.510
- I'll clip off something.
- The tower over there...

01:39:15.594 --> 01:39:17.929
- That's where it is.
- And what about the other tower?

01:39:18.012 --> 01:39:19.430
- Give me that!
- That is where...

01:39:19.514 --> 01:39:22.850
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would I lie to you?

01:39:24.018 --> 01:39:25.770
Not if you wanted to live.

01:39:26.687 --> 01:39:30.607
Now, if I'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight...

01:39:34.111 --> 01:39:36.529
- I don't think I could.
- You must.

01:39:42.652 --> 01:39:43.903
Come on.

01:39:46.155 --> 01:39:47.406
I don't like this plan.

01:39:47.489 --> 01:39:50.158
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.

01:39:50.409 --> 01:39:51.993
You still don't understand.

01:39:52.077 --> 01:39:54.245
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

01:39:54.412 --> 01:39:56.331
We must save my family.

01:39:56.831 --> 01:39:59.667
If you're late, run like hell.

01:40:03.921 --> 01:40:05.506
Don't be late.

01:40:19.018 --> 01:40:21.604
Now go. Go.

01:40:47.294 --> 01:40:49.963
Get off me, you vermin from hell!

01:40:53.633 --> 01:40:57.136
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

01:40:57.303 --> 01:41:01.390
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!

01:41:01.974 --> 01:41:06.145
And now you must give that life
to my children.

01:41:06.812 --> 01:41:07.896
Up!

01:42:22.298 --> 01:42:23.883
There it is.

01:42:29.137 --> 01:42:30.806
I'll go first.

01:42:53.243 --> 01:42:54.327
Carl!

01:42:56.996 --> 01:42:59.082
Stay as long as you like.

01:42:59.165 --> 01:43:01.918
You try to get lgor. Igor get you!

01:43:45.124 --> 01:43:49.461
- Go ahead. Grab it.
- You go ahead and grab it.

01:43:49.711 --> 01:43:51.296
If there's one thing I've learned...

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.799
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.

01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:04.725
- Did I scare you?
- No.

01:44:05.809 --> 01:44:09.313
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.

01:44:16.736 --> 01:44:19.322
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

01:44:19.489 --> 01:44:21.157
Get it!

01:44:29.998 --> 01:44:32.167
Hot.

01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:33.335
- Come on!
- Yes.

01:44:33.418 --> 01:44:36.921
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:41.842
You can't go until I say you can go!

01:44:41.926 --> 01:44:43.511
Keep running, Carl!

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:47.514
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!

01:45:31.054 --> 01:45:32.556
Oh, my God!

01:46:02.583 --> 01:46:06.253
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

01:46:06.337 --> 01:46:09.089
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.

01:46:09.172 --> 01:46:10.924
Yes. You want one?

01:46:11.008 --> 01:46:13.593
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

01:46:13.677 --> 01:46:15.595
I am accustomed to pain.

01:46:15.678 --> 01:46:17.430
It lets you know you're alive.

01:46:35.447 --> 01:46:37.615
Give me life!

01:46:52.879 --> 01:46:56.633
One more bolt
and my young will live.

01:47:10.145 --> 01:47:12.397
You're almost out, my friend!

01:49:30.107 --> 01:49:31.608
Help me!

01:49:32.192 --> 01:49:34.277
But you're supposed to die.

01:49:34.944 --> 01:49:37.197
I want to live.

01:49:40.116 --> 01:49:41.534
All right!

01:49:46.872 --> 01:49:49.041
Be happy in the knowledge...

01:49:49.124 --> 01:49:53.128
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

01:49:57.498 --> 01:49:59.667
Hang on!

01:50:00.501 --> 01:50:02.836
I'll swing you loose!

01:50:36.784 --> 01:50:38.786
You are too late, my friend.

01:50:40.204 --> 01:50:42.123
My children live.

01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:46.126
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.711
Correct.

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:51.715
So be it.

01:50:55.969 --> 01:50:57.053
One.

01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:06.562
No, this cannot be.

01:51:19.824 --> 01:51:22.993
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

01:51:23.494 --> 01:51:27.331
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

01:52:14.457 --> 01:52:18.878
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!

01:52:22.882 --> 01:52:24.216
Now!

01:52:25.551 --> 01:52:26.969
Thank you.

01:52:53.576 --> 01:52:58.080
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!

01:53:02.084 --> 01:53:03.252
Hurry!

01:53:13.845 --> 01:53:16.014
Throw it to me, Carl!

01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:23.937
Yes!

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.460
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.630
But I escaped. So can you.

01:54:34.502 --> 01:54:36.170
Anna, my love...

01:54:36.504 --> 01:54:40.091
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

01:54:40.841 --> 01:54:42.927
What do you think of that?

01:54:47.097 --> 01:54:49.850
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

01:54:49.933 --> 01:54:52.102
Don't stand there talking about it.

01:55:16.457 --> 01:55:18.125
Don't you understand?

01:55:18.209 --> 01:55:22.129
We could be friends. Partners!

01:55:23.547 --> 01:55:25.215
Brothers-in-arms!

01:55:55.743 --> 01:56:00.247
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

01:56:00.748 --> 01:56:04.501
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

01:56:05.502 --> 01:56:08.005
to be the Left Hand of God.

01:56:10.674 --> 01:56:13.426
All I want is life, Gabriel.

01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:16.179
The continuation of my kind.

01:56:17.013 --> 01:56:20.766
And perhaps the return of my ring.

01:56:24.937 --> 01:56:27.856
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

01:56:29.357 --> 01:56:33.945
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.615
Some things
are better left forgotten.

01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:12.480
For God!

01:57:21.489 --> 01:57:22.990
God forgive me.

01:57:58.022 --> 01:57:59.440
She's dead.

01:58:57.076 --> 01:59:00.496
"Eternal rest grant unto her,
Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light...

01:59:00.579 --> 01:59:02.998
"shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all...

01:59:09.671 --> 01:59:12.507
"On her soul and the souls of all...

01:59:12.841 --> 01:59:16.177
"the dead faithful have mercy..."
