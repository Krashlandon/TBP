WEBVTT

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.711
Captain.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.137
Merkel's guys.
They ship out tomorrow too.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.819
Okay, sailors!
Let's go set that cathouse on fire!

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.279
Just don't miss your mark!

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.741
Stuff some season's greetings
in there!

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.785
Scared fuckers.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:24.538
They need sex
like the infantry needs alcohol.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.375
What's going on here?

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.335
Good luck!

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.387
Captain!

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.848
My 2nd officer.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.271
This is Lieutenant Werner,
naval war correspondent.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.940
He'll ship outwith us.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.529
He'll report anything of interest.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.241
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.034
Good evening.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.542
This way, lieutenant.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.044
U-boat crews need relaxation.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.255
Good evening.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.423
Two beers.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.634
Yes, captain.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.567
Where's Thomsen?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.361
Doesn't he want
to celebrate his medal?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.660
Any news from Cologne?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.001
No personal calls allowed
till after 10 p.m.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.882
Two beers.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.806
Reporting back from U-96.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.309
Munitions and provisions aboard,
ready to put to sea.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.561
Thanks, 1st.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.649
Attention, please!

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.401
Let's give
our newly decorated officer...

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.820
...Captain Thomsen...

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.488
...three cheers!

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.502
That's Thomsen for you.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.838
One of the old guard.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.589
Always drunk now.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.064
My respects, Thomsen!

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:05.323
Quiet in this whorehouse!

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.459
A toast to our wonderful...

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.837
...abstaining...

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.756
<i>mwomarfless Fuhrer.</i>

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.469
Who rose gloriously...

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.805
...from apprentice painter...

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.975
...to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.062
What? Isn't it true?

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:40.483
He's the great naval expert...

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.237
...who took it upon himself...

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.032
...in his wisdom--

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.168
How's it go again?

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.925
Who's been showing
that English bedwetter...

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.929
...that cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill...

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.724
...where to go stick...

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.686
...his cigars!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.812
Sorry.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.816
See you tomorrow.
I've got a call to make.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.250
It's not like the old gang.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.715
These are so green and eager.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.260
Wet behind the ears.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.762
Braggarts.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:39.060
Cheeks together,
balls in their hands...

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.273
...and belief
in the FiJhrer in their eyes.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.361
They'll calm down soon enough.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.806
You're a pig's ass!

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:43.750
Fight! Win! Or Die!

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.643
Come on, Phillip, get up!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.104
Help me here!

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.530
I wanted to...

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.198
...really...

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.284
...screw my brains out--

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.870
I am not in the condition
to fuck.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.497
It's all right.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.222
That's Thomsen's boat.

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.516
Equipment checks okay?

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.811
The starboard propeller had
a bent blade.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.566
That's what caused whining
on silent runs.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:53.403
We have a brand-new propeller
now, captain.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.438
Our boat.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.649
Crew at attention!

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:36.905
Captain's revue, eyes left.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.374
Crew reporting for duty.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.710
All decks ready to sail.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.213
Thank you, 1st officer.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.429
At ease!

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.560
Now he's going to deliver a speech.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.114
Well, men...

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.327
Everything okay?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.498
Man your stations.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.084
Nice speech, or not?

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:29.517
Hail and victory and sink them all!

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.368
Pick up those vegetables.
This is no grocery store!

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.245
Command post.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:52.206
Torpedo workshop and storage.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:55.168
Shape up and your mugs
will make the newspaper!

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.463
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Follow me.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.089
This is our shit house.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.133
One hole for fifty men.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.427
The other's full of provisions.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.431
More space for food
than for shit. Some logic.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.725
Chief petty officer's.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.643
My home, so to speak.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.729
Here's the officers' mess.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.899
Don't stow stuff that way!

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.861
It's nice in here.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.112
Where are you?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.323
Sorry, coming. May I?

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.576
Careful!

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.830
Here's the radio room.
Over here, the control room.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.040
Just what we need.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.750
The control room.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.461
The boat's command center.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.925
This leads to quarters.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.931
Gotta move this stuff.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.142
Morning, lieutenant.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.021
Petty officers sleep here.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.731
Twelve men.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.360
Two men share most bunks,
depending on their duties.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:07.281
If one's on guard, the next one sleeps
in the other's stink. Right?

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.827
This is your bunk.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.454
Just for you, our guest.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.581
That's for you too.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.334
Your oxygen mask.
Very important!

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.754
Not much good except
in calm seas.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.715
It comes in handy
when the diesel reeks.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.552
Or when Frenssen farts.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.263
Come along.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.181
Corning through!

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.976
This is the galley.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.437
And this is Johann, the ghost.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.105
Who?

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.695
Hey, Johann,
everything greased up?

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.558
It was about time to sail again.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.397
Attention.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.733
Zero.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.696
36 degrees, 20.5 minutes.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.823
Watch out!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.452
This area gives me the creeps.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.875
The Royal Navy knows exactly
when we sail.

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:46.923
There are enough informants
out there.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.178
Shipyard workers, cleaners,
hookers.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.893
Watch out. Eggs.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.607
- Man on bridge?
- Yes.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.027
Alarm!

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.251
All hands forward!

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.127
Come on, let's go!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.754
Wake up, you guys!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:30.591
Move that body.
Hop, hop! Let's go!

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.141
I'll kick your asses till they bleed!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.478
That's an alarm, damn it!

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.313
This ain't a cruise ship!

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.960
Blow main dive tank.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.674
Stern to 10.

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:25.605
April Fools.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.523
Exercise is good for you.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.692
Can't let no moss grow.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.861
Practice drill.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.698
Steady as she goes.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.701
Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.704
Both up.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.836
- Boat trimmed.
- Close main vents.

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.799
Vents closed.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.885
Deeper, chief.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.554
Let's see if these valves are tight.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.683
Bow down 15, stern up 10.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.738
The shipyard rates it to 9O meters.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.408
But we can go deeper.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.589
Of course, there's a limit.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.343
We can only take
so much pressure...

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:42.098
...before the boat's crushed.

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:55.945
Secure upper hatches.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.748
- It's water pressure.
- Yes, of course.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.134
Deeper.

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.722
140 meters.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.313
It's gotta take it.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.815
150.

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:42.283
160 meters.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.498
That's all today.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.168
Surface.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.336
Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.338
Your girl?

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:43.385
French?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.898
You know that florist next
to the Café A I'Ami Pierrot?

00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:58.526
Where?

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.402
A I'Ami Pierrot.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.571
Yeah, sure...

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.240
...the two salesgirls...

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.951
...Jeannette and...
What's her name?

00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:09.411
Frangoise.

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:14.083
We're engaged.

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.963
Secretly, of course.

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:27.429
May I?

00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:35.604
Really very pretty.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.194
What's wrong?

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.617
She's pregnant.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:53.831
But...

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.793
...you know what that means.

00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.963
Once the Partisans find out...

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.298
...her kid's half-German--

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.634
What can I do?

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.637
She definitely wants it.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.646
You've got a problem.

00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:18.248
Those guys in Berlin got nothing
but insults for Churchill.

00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.961
How's it go again?

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.300
"Drunkard"...

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.387
..."Guzzler"...

00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:35.057
..."Paralytic."

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:40.771
He's sending a lot of heat our way
for a paralyzed drunk.

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.315
Nonetheless...

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.609
...we'll force him to his knees.

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.486
That is my firm belief.

00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:52.908
Listen, smart guy...

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:58.080
...he's far from being on his knees.

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.419
Wonder how many ships
get through.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:08.424
Especially now, while we're staring
at the walls and waiting.

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:12.636
Where are our planes and scouts,
Herr Géring?

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:15.264
The enemy's got plenty.

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:21.103
Hot air, that's all that comes out
of that fat slob.

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:29.278
Braggarts, nothing but braggarts.

00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:30.779
All of them.

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:39.997
Go on...

00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.708
...take it down.

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:43.876
Notes...

00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:46.128
...for your "Heroes' Epic"...

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.381
...and the propaganda machine.

00:25:54.136 --> 00:25:56.180
Where's the music?

00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:01.351
Our Hitler Youth leader here
could play us a record.

00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:07.816
That "Tipperary" song,
if you please!

00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:25.501
Hey, now we're the Royal Navy.

00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:38.305
This record won't hurt...

00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.224
...your ideological edifice.

00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.592
This could work.

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:24.601
A new course?

00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.191
Wait and see.

00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:37.948
May I see the radiogram?

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:48.876
"Convoy reported,
coordinates AK 2246...

00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:51.753
...general course about 60 degrees...

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.590
...at 8 nautical miles."
From U-37.

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:58.427
U-37 is Marten's boat.
He's after a convoy.

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.729
Too far away. Can't make it.

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.609
Damn this waiting!

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:16.069
Will we ever see some action?

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.580
Don't let me get in your way.

00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:28.874
One more! Good.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.212
And another.

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.139
A bit to the left.
Maybe a profile shot.

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.975
Another pose, a little to the--

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:00.989
Who did that?

00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:06.119
Who did that?

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:58.088
Tell me...

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:02.009
...you got hairs in your nose?

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.761
Why?

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:07.306
Because I've got some in my ass.

00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:10.851
We can tie them together.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.435
"Personal hygiene," four letters?

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.773
Bath.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:02.652
Thanks.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.954
"Innermost affection," four letters?

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:17.125
Love.

00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:19.169
Exactly.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.075
Drop them.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.433
You pig.

00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:16.601
Crabs.

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:20.272
A whole army of crabs.

00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:23.692
They'll eat little guys
like you to the bone.

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:31.366
Give that hussy some puffy!

00:32:43.545 --> 00:32:44.838
Number One.

00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:46.381
Lieutenant?

00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:48.175
Where's the medic?

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:50.844
In the bow.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.685
This can't be true!

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.197
Watch fuel flow!

00:33:10.363 --> 00:33:11.907
0K8)'-

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:29.966
Watch out!

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:32.135
- Tough times, huh?
- What's up?

00:33:32.302 --> 00:33:34.054
U-32, Berthold's boat...

00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:37.599
...discovered a convoy.
We'll be there in 10 hours.

00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:54.199
That burns some fuel, huh?

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:57.452
Asshole.

00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.506
Damn this weather!

00:34:10.799 --> 00:34:12.050
What's it look like?

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:13.635
Just a moment.

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:19.349
Enemy's position here,
if they haven't zig-zagged.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:24.396
Vessel! Starboard ahead!

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.988
Forty degrees, over that way!

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.074
See it.

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:43.331
That's no freighter.

00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:48.461
That's a damn destroyer.

00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:50.922
Approaching.

00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.466
Get below.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:01.182
Flood tanks!

00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:14.779
Periscope depth.

00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:34.382
Stand by battle stations.

00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.987
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:06.081
He wants to attack the destroyer.
That's madness in this weather.

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:10.418
Watch our depth!

00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:12.921
Bow up 2.

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:15.090
Stern down 2.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:19.844
Gently.

00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:23.556
Bow average...

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.433
...13.5 meters.

00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:32.524
Open torpedo hatches.

00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.542
Damn.

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:12.272
Close hatches! Dive fast!

00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:21.865
Depth charges!

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:34.836
Quick, get fuses!

00:37:36.045 --> 00:37:38.256
Check outboard valves.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.525
Control room secured.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.361
All clear forward.

00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.534
No serious damages.

00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:12.415
They actually spotted our periscope.

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.797
Hard to believe in this heavy sea.

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.410
Watch your sector.

00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:52.789
What?

00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:55.291
Pull yourself together!

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.795
Have you gone crazy?

00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:06.970
Have you heard?

00:39:07.387 --> 00:39:09.013
Dufte is engaged.

00:39:09.848 --> 00:39:12.016
Poor woman!

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.476
Asshole!

00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:15.603
I thought he only jerks off.

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:19.941
Yeah, breed him
with a chimp at the zoo.

00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:23.653
Here are photos of his lady.

00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.154
Give them back!

00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.328
I can't believe it.

00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:34.122
You screw this bag?

00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:56.561
Watch out!

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.832
Man overboard!

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:22.689
Move! Hold onto him!

00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:25.400
Put him on the chart box!

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.910
Get the medic case!

00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:37.704
Damn it!

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.081
The medic case, damn it!

00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:41.833
Prepare to dive!

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:03.980
"A military leader leads
through self-discipline.

00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:07.942
Without his example,
education is impossible."

00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:11.529
Three broken ribs,
one open wound.

00:42:12.822 --> 00:42:14.323
Could be worse.

00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:19.787
Shitty month.

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.625
Real shitty.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.545
Mildew is good for you.

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.885
It's the next best thing...

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.138
...to fresh lettuce.

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:44.479
Let's be grateful
for anything that grows here.

00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:55.865
They'll have snow back home now.

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.208
Funny.

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:11.339
I haven't seen snow in years.

00:43:14.884 --> 00:43:15.927
May I?

00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:17.386
By all means.

00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:33.111
Your wife?

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:17.446
Over there, ahead!

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:25.913
Captain, U-boat, port ahead!

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:30.543
German boat, German U-boat!

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:37.466
Bearing 350 degrees.
Almost straight ahead!

00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.018
God, you're right!

00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.564
All engines stop.
Get that signal lamp up!

00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:27.225
That's Thomsen!

00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.937
All back half.

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:52.583
Happy hunting, you old sea dog!

00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:03.886
Phillip, my friend.

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:07.390
So they kicked you out here again.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.184
No tales of victory, huh?

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.066
Just some position reports.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.862
SOS calls from far-off boats.

00:47:06.907 --> 00:47:10.328
If anyone breaks a rudder
in this weather...

00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:17.001
...they better start praying.

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:24.925
The sea can't drown us, though.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:29.597
There's no ship
as seaworthy as ours.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:48.699
Play that record.

00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:52.953
You know which one.

00:49:14.452 --> 00:49:15.453
What's going on?

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:16.871
Convoy.

00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:35.389
- Man on bridge?
- Affirmative.

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:06.795
Convoy putting to sea.
Five columns.

00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:09.006
Real big show.

00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:15.262
You see any escort?

00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:16.514
Destroyers?

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:20.059
Nope, nothing.

00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:22.353
No security. Nothing.

00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:29.401
Strange.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:35.032
Are they chasing one of ours
on the other side?

00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:46.126
Damn moonlight.

00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:53.592
- How many of ours are here?
- Five.

00:50:57.846 --> 00:50:59.682
Shall we risk it?

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:05.104
I think so, captain.

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.943
Port to 180 degrees.

00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:12.361
New course...

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.322
...port to 180 degrees.

00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:23.914
How's it feel to you, Kriechbaum?

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.296
It will work, captain. For sure.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.394
Tubes 1 to 4,
prepare for surface firing.

00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.271
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:48.897
I'll take the helm.

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:51.108
Target optics to bridge.

00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:15.591
All ahead full,
port to 107 degrees.

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:17.468
Commencing attack!

00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:23.265
Watch the oil pressure!

00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:29.480
Bow right, position 50.

00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:31.106
Check.

00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:33.901
Range: 2200.

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:37.363
Those two that overlap...

00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:41.325
...double blast the fat one,
single shots for the other.

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.285
Tracking target.

00:52:43.452 --> 00:52:46.789
All ahead one-third.

00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:48.791
Open torpedo hatches.

00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:53.921
Tubes 1 and <i>2</i> coordinates:
Target bearing 63.

00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.756
Sights adjusted.

00:52:56.674 --> 00:52:58.133
Keep tracking target.

00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:00.010
Target acquisition.

00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:02.137
Tubes 1 and 2...

00:53:02.346 --> 00:53:04.306
...fire at will.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.436
Tube 1, fire!

00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:13.440
Tube 2.

00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:18.529
Tube 3, stand by.

00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:24.326
Fire!

00:53:26.662 --> 00:53:29.331
Tube 4 ready.

00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.168
Fire!

00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:35.462
Destroyer dead ahead!

00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:38.674
They're firing!

00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:41.635
Alarm!

00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:18.338
Got that one.

00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:22.384
Yeah, boys, we got one!

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.284
Number three.

00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.219
Two going down.

00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:23.237
Their bulkheads are breaking.
They're drowning.

00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.182
All ahead full!

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.809
Dump 150 liters!

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.918
Asdic.

00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:05.505
Ultrasonic detection system.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:15.265
Pigs. Rotten pigs.

00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:26.985
Quiet. Keep quiet.

00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:21.623
Silent run.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.960
Fifty r.p.m. Shut off ventilators.

00:58:26.753 --> 00:58:27.921
Port 15.

00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:49.818
All ahead full!

00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:01.621
Shut it off!

00:59:17.137 --> 00:59:21.141
Shut down auxiliary control panel!

00:59:57.052 --> 00:59:59.346
Connect ventilation cartridges.

00:59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.933
Start ventilators, connect cartridges.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.588
They ain't kidding.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:37.884
They really want to shake us up.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.060
So that was all?

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.480
Calling it a day?

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.913
Boy, we really gave it to them...

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.086
...when those bulkheads broke
to pieces.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.517
What's the bearing?

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.438
Steady at 65 degrees.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.861
Deeper. Silent run.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.973
Still deeper.
Three degrees starboard.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.309
Let's throw them...

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.689
...for another little loop.

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.472
Contact bearing 270 degrees.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.686
Fading.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.638
Shit.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.643
Second propeller sounds, 76 degrees.
Closing fast.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.482
Reinforcements.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.237
Those bastards.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.103
Deeper.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.277
Deeper still.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.117
Bow down 10.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.911
Stern up 7.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.390
190 meters.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.486
200 meters.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:21.000
210 meters.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.594
220 meters.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.187
230 meters.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:55.118
The bolts! They're bursting!

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.454
Keep the boat from dropping!
Up 10 meters!

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.873
All ahead one-half!

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:09.883
Quiet, men, quiet.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.369
Go to 150 meters! All ahead full!

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.630
Port 20!

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.340
Steer 50 degrees!

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.594
Pretty good shooting, mister.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.053
Quiet, damn it!

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.889
I want proper damage reports!

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:52.026
Permission to check diesel?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.405
Take over the helm!

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:08.042
Gaskets! Half-inch, hurry!

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:11.671
Where are you?

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.007
I need those gaskets!

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.641
The more they throw,
the sooner they run out.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:42.869
Leakage above
exhaust vent repaired.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:46.331
150 meters, all ahead full.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.225
What's the matter?

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.902
Return to your battle station.

01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:17.236
At once!

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:32.335
Pull yourself together!

01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:34.671
Back!

01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:41.386
Go back, Johann.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.409
Take him aft, quickly!

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.621
He's gone, captain.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.633
Forget the headset.
We can hear it anyway.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.410
Come on, let's go.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:58.272
Boat dropping!
180 meters!

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.568
190 meters!

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.473
220 meters!

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.768
We're drowning!

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.800
Take this down for your log book.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.182
After 6 hours of silent run...

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.143
...it seems certain...

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:03.064
...the enemy destroyers lost us.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:09.528
At 210 degrees...

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.281
...very heavy fire blazing.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.618
Assume it to be the tanker we hit.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.878
Surface in 1O minutes.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.044
See, lieutenant...

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.676
...they didn't kill us after all.

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:25.998
Her backbone is broken.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:33.714
Damn tough ship, won't drown.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.551
Let's get to it.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.512
Target optics to bridge.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:42.014
Flood tube 1.

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.857
Enemy movement nil.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:56.904
Range: 650 meters.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:00.533
Depth 4, torpedo speed 30.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.412
Target point,
directly before aft mast.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.541
Tube 1 ready.

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:12.878
Fire!

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:58.674
Men still on board!

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.980
Why weren't they rescued?

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:15.691
Damn it!

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.484
After all these hours!

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.056
They're swimming for us.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.101
All back one-half!

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.595
I want to apologize.

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.765
You can't just apologize.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:58.645
You left your battle station
at a critical time.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.815
Also, you disobeyed my order.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.872
Will I be court-martialed?

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.882
How many war patrols for you?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.468
It's my ninth.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.477
You, of all people, Johann.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.982
It's never happened before.

01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:58.831
My nerves cracked somehow.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:07.506
It won't happen again.
You can count on me.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.386
I swear.

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:17.224
All right, Johann.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.020
No court martial?

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.612
Go on to bed.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.067
Yeah.
Christmas in La Rochelle.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.777
Gonna get laid again.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.738
All of those sexy nurses...

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:16.825
...hot telephone operators,
all those warm bodies.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:18.535
Screwing like mad.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:23.165
A nice, slow afternoon fuck.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.043
<i>- Attention.
- Our master's voice.</i>

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:27.961
<i>La Rochelle's out.</i>

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:32.424
<i>We've been ordered to a new port.</i>

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:34.092
<i>La Spezia...</i>

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:37.888
<i>...in the Mediterranean.</i>

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.683
<i>Fuel and provisions out of Vigo first.</i>

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.977
<i>That's in Spain.</i>

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:45.687
<i>That is all.</i>

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.319
Those bastards stuck it to us.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:54.613
Shit.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.783
No getting laid.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.578
No sexy nurses.
No hot telephone operators.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:03.830
Horse shit!

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.085
Christmas with the Macaronis.

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:10.879
Got to get there first, stupid!

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:12.548
What do you mean?

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.467
Gibraltar!

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.971
Stick a finger up your ass
to get the idea.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.811
It's as tight as a virgin.

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:30.399
We'll need Vaseline to get through.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:01.221
You and the chief will go ashore
in Vigo.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.557
How's that?

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.476
I'll radio it in a minute.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:13.734
I'll have to find a replacement
for the chief.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:20.157
They'll smuggle you
through Spain somehow...

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.369
...even if you have
to dress like gypsies.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.248
- But I was on for the whole--
- No heroics.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:32.961
It's already settled.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.381
One guy alone would be tough.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:43.513
We've got agents to get you through.

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.899
The chief is exhausted.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.445
He's got to go ashore.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.661
Aye, aye, sir.

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:21.718
Pretty bad, huh?

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:36.858
I'm going ashore at Vigo...

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:39.945
...with the chief.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.658
Captain's orders.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:54.876
Want me to take your letters?

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.143
But it's a big pile.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.774
Well, it's a big love, right?

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.910
Equalize pressure.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.915
All quiet.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.125
White light.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.085
Watch where you stomp.

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.505
Quiet, man!

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.641
We've got to find the right tub here.

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.020
The "Weser"...

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.942
...a German merchant vessel,
is interned here.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:47.322
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and provisions.

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:50.075
Just for us.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:53.703
Yeah, 1st class service.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:22.691
Gentlemen.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:32.367
We welcome our heroic
German U-boat crew.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:47.132
A wholehearted welcome...

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.092
...captain.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:53.138
No, please, not me.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.224
This is the captain.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.602
MY aDOIOgies.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:04.816
Welcome aboard the "Weser,"
captain.

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:10.322
A real hero, in person.
I am most delighted.

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:12.991
Well, gentlemen...

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:15.452
...here they are...

01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:18.079
...heroes of the deep.

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.457
The famous grey wolves...

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:24.002
...with us,
inside our modest cabin...

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.463
...so to speak.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:29.257
Captain, allow me.

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:30.926
A warm welcome.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.178
Nice tugboat you've got here.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.476
We're well prepared...

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:42.979
...in all modesty, of course,
but not bad at all.

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:46.524
Like a taste of home,
so to speak.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:50.654
Fresh bread,
cakes from our own bakery...

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:55.200
...bacon, fresh sausages,
stuffed just today, naturally.

01:30:56.826 --> 01:30:59.454
You've got to tell us your news.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:02.540
You can't imagine our curiosity.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:07.337
It's not an easy life here,
appearances to the contrary.

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:11.383
There's plenty of fuel and food
to eat...

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:14.552
...but torpedoes are difficult
to come by.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.181
But we always have our ways.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:23.812
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but there's no love lost between us.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:26.189
Christmas bread.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.026
So, tell me...

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.237
...how many ships have you sunk?

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.823
Let me guess--

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.533
The champagne.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.702
How forgetful of me.

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:40.203
Please.

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:42.497
Gentlemen.

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:47.252
We drink to your health.

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:49.421
We are so proud of you.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:52.924
We toast the German U-boats...

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.343
...and our beloved FUh--

01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:59.347
I forget we're not at home here...

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.391
...if you know what I mean.

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:03.852
Cheers.

01:32:04.686 --> 01:32:06.604
To your health.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:11.568
Come on, dig in.

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:13.945
Let's dive into this stuff.

01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:20.869
Come, captain, tell us all.

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:23.329
We're so very curious.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.623
Those are fresh figs.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.717
Never had one before.

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:48.813
Quiet, gentlemen.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.941
They almost had us this time.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:04.704
Herr Seewald,
we've been expecting you.

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:10.794
The delegate of the naval attache.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:15.632
I have messages from headquarters.

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:20.804
But first,
your orders for Gibraltar.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.185
And this radiogram.

01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:40.865
Chief, Lieutenant Werner.

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.372
We're taking a stroll.

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:58.341
What's going on?

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:00.218
Bad news.

01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:09.811
Request was denied
by headquarters.

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:21.030
You've got to stay on board.
You too, lieutenant.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.624
I'm sorry.

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:37.755
It's probably just as well.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.636
Who knows who they'd
replace me with?

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:51.811
Might be one of those
wet-behind-the-ears kids.

01:35:00.987 --> 01:35:02.947
Very well could be.

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.872
They should've put some pussy
in storage for screwing.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:15.126
Yeah, you'd be fighting
Spanish crabs by now.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.503
Better than blue balls!

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:20.882
Move it and clear the chart table.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:23.134
I can't navigate on bananas.

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:26.554
Are you nuts? Move that fruit.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:29.057
The depth controls are blocked.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.393
That's a Christmas tree?

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.146
It ain't camouflage for the bridge.

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.402
We're staying on board.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.488
Orders from headquarters.

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:56.834
Sorry, Ullman.

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:22.527
Seven miles between coasts.

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:25.196
A tight squeeze, I'd say.

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.701
These are the British docks.

01:36:30.535 --> 01:36:34.747
Their only port for repairs
in the western Mediterranean.

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:39.210
It will be well protected.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.091
All kinds of defenses.

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:51.389
Anything floating will be
on the water.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:57.270
We'll have to maneuver through it.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.690
That's the situation.

01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:17.248
We'll move under cover
of darkness...

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:22.253
...skimming the surface.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:27.091
We'll cut right
through the English ships.

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.435
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar
as we can get.

01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:48.237
Then we'll dive...

01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:51.949
...and let ourselves drop.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.579
Very simple trick.

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:01.334
Let the current draw us
through the strait.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.629
No racket.

01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:08.299
It saves fuel.

01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:18.976
So, Kriechbaum?

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:28.152
Not bad, captain.

01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:56.848
Let's go.

01:39:01.477 --> 01:39:04.147
All ahead one-half.

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:11.487
Navigator and I stay,
everyone else clear the bridge.

01:39:44.437 --> 01:39:47.064
Half the English fleet is here.

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:52.361
Two degrees to port.
Switch to electric motor.

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.024
Destroyer across port.

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:32.610
Range: 800, running parallel.

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:34.737
What's he doing?

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:36.489
Closing in?

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:44.956
No, moving ahead.

01:40:46.123 --> 01:40:47.625
Very good.

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:55.299
Left full rudder.

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:59.428
All ahead full.

01:41:02.098 --> 01:41:03.683
All right, then.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.321
Right full rudder! All ahead full.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:02.283
Damn!

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.770
Gibraltar.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.428
Alarm!

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:05.846
Flood tanks!

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:12.937
Watch out, don't dive!

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:16.357
- Captain's still on bridge!
- Kriechbaum's wounded!

01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:20.820
Both diesels ahead full!

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:23.489
Blow all tanks!

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:25.783
Prepare to abandon ship!

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:31.122
Medic to officers' mess immediately!

01:43:35.334 --> 01:43:38.045
Where's the medic?

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:41.382
Maximum power!
Right full rudder!

01:43:43.926 --> 01:43:45.511
All men into rescue gear!

01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:47.263
Prepare to abandon!

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.014
Hold this!

01:43:56.313 --> 01:44:00.317
Faster, faster!

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.121
Get a compress!

01:44:23.966 --> 01:44:27.261
Gotta shut down port diesel.
It's pulled loose.

01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:29.054
Keep full speed!

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:32.808
Give it everything she's got!

01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:35.144
What's he going to do?

01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:36.353
Southern course...

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.898
...moving toward the African coast.

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:50.117
Damn.

01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:56.040
Flood tanks!

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:58.375
All men to bow!

01:45:09.178 --> 01:45:10.387
Down to 9O meters.

01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:18.062
- Bow plane jammed!
- Use manual rudder!

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:23.484
Bow plane stuck
in full down position!

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.536
Both engines stop.

01:45:33.911 --> 01:45:35.996
All men aft!

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.672
Hurry! Faster!

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:46.173
Trim all to stern!

01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:48.926
Ballast pump down!

01:45:49.093 --> 01:45:50.094
Trim with air!

01:45:53.806 --> 01:45:54.932
Still sinking.

01:45:55.099 --> 01:45:56.684
Load unchanged.

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:59.061
Gotta lose weight!

01:45:59.436 --> 01:46:01.438
Pump 1000 liters!

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:06.235
Shut him up, medic!

01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:09.613
Main bilge pump down!

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:12.408
Blow tanks?

01:46:12.741 --> 01:46:14.451
All back full!

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:22.459
Boat not responding.

01:46:22.668 --> 01:46:26.255
Blow tanks. Blow tanks!

01:46:26.422 --> 01:46:27.423
Blow front.

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:33.345
Stop now.

01:46:35.848 --> 01:46:38.350
Why don't you stop!

01:46:40.102 --> 01:46:42.563
Give it whatever she's got, chief!

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:43.981
Blow them all!

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:47.109
Come on up.

01:47:13.636 --> 01:47:16.639
Boat is beyond control.

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:23.228
ZOO.

01:47:27.816 --> 01:47:28.817
210.

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:34.865
220 meters.

01:47:37.409 --> 01:47:39.328
Beyond 230.

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:42.122
240 meters.

01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:47.002
250 meters.

01:47:52.216 --> 01:47:53.842
My God.

01:47:55.678 --> 01:47:57.805
Do not turn...

01:47:58.263 --> 01:48:00.516
...Thy face away from me.

01:48:51.567 --> 01:48:53.235
A shovelful of sand.

01:48:56.613 --> 01:49:00.534
God threw a shovelful
of sand beneath our keel.

01:49:12.588 --> 01:49:14.089
280 meters.

01:49:15.674 --> 01:49:17.843
This boat's amazing.

01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:06.266
Torpedo hatch taking water!

01:50:09.394 --> 01:50:11.647
Taking water behind control panel!

01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:16.777
Taking water in motor bilge!

01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:19.947
Tube 5 taking water!

01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:25.285
What you need?

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:28.413
- Leakage plugs.
- In the bow.

01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:31.750
Exhaust valve?

01:50:32.417 --> 01:50:34.628
Leakage plugs! Move!

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.259
Give me that lamp!

01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:42.636
I need a wrench, damn it!

01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:44.513
Where are my reports?

01:50:45.347 --> 01:50:47.558
Taking water at tower frame!

01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:49.726
Where are the tools?

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:58.026
- Where is it?
- Bilge pump!

01:50:58.861 --> 01:51:00.612
Motor control panels down!

01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:02.197
Diesel's all busted!

01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:04.116
I demand proper reports!

01:51:10.998 --> 01:51:11.999
Where's it worst?

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:15.252
Shaft valves and housing.

01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:18.463
Machinist, battery two...

01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:20.632
...determine damages.

01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:25.596
Don't strip the crankshafts.

01:51:25.762 --> 01:51:26.972
Can't see a thing!

01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:30.184
Push harder!

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:31.602
I'm pushing!

01:51:32.394 --> 01:51:34.897
Can't get the wedge in!

01:51:35.063 --> 01:51:36.773
Give me that hammer!

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.782
Need more men aft?

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:48.160
I'll find out!

01:51:50.204 --> 01:51:51.663
- Damn it.
- Can I help?

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:53.498
Hold the light!

01:51:54.291 --> 01:51:57.544
Father, don't forsake us.

01:51:58.795 --> 01:52:00.589
Stupid asshole!

01:52:01.715 --> 01:52:02.758
Damn idiot.

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:06.303
I need the diesel room toolbox.

01:52:06.511 --> 01:52:08.263
Hurry!

01:52:08.889 --> 01:52:10.557
Where are the tools?

01:52:13.977 --> 01:52:15.187
Bigger wrench!

01:52:15.771 --> 01:52:17.731
Leakage in diesel bilge!

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:30.077
Tighten them carefully.
Don't break the bolts.

01:52:31.954 --> 01:52:33.163
Cooling pipe leaking!

01:52:36.375 --> 01:52:39.711
Get down there
and tighten those valves!

01:52:42.506 --> 01:52:45.342
More plugs. Hurry!

01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:59.856
Gently, men.

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:11.410
Taking water fast in stern.

01:53:11.576 --> 01:53:16.373
All hull valves burst.
Cooling system down.

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:21.169
Compressors dislodged.
Shaft valves taking water.

01:53:22.921 --> 01:53:24.881
What about fuel leaks?

01:53:25.048 --> 01:53:26.133
Can't tell yet.

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:30.137
- Anything else?
- Battery cells are cracked.

01:53:30.304 --> 01:53:32.306
They can't take this.

01:53:39.396 --> 01:53:40.605
Acid in the bilge.

01:53:40.772 --> 01:53:44.568
Neutralize with lime wash.
Count drained cells.

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:47.904
Get battery connectors, hurry!

01:54:03.045 --> 01:54:06.590
There.
The valve underneath the lock.

01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:10.969
I need plugs and a hammer!

01:54:12.262 --> 01:54:15.182
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

01:54:16.975 --> 01:54:18.435
Careful.

01:54:25.108 --> 01:54:26.777
Twenty-four cells drained.

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:29.905
Twenty-four cells. Holy shit.

01:54:39.414 --> 01:54:41.625
We're way short of connectors.

01:54:46.046 --> 01:54:49.466
He's got to bridge
those damaged cells.

01:54:49.758 --> 01:54:51.385
Or else we've had it.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:59.059
Water in the engine room
going to the torpedo tube.

01:54:59.226 --> 01:55:01.228
Increasing.

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:09.194
Go. Pliers.

01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:15.826
Can't tighten it. Can't see.

01:55:15.992 --> 01:55:17.911
Lieutenant, lights!

01:55:19.329 --> 01:55:21.832
If we don't fix this, we're goners!

01:55:31.174 --> 01:55:33.802
To the right, more to the right.

01:55:48.066 --> 01:55:49.359
Wire.

01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.820
I need wire for bridging.

01:55:52.904 --> 01:55:55.991
Move it, we need wire.
Hurry up.

01:56:03.206 --> 01:56:06.376
The chief needs wire.
Look for wire.

01:56:07.252 --> 01:56:09.713
- What kind of a wire?
- Well, some heavy wire, man.

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.382
Incredible torpedoes in these tubes.

01:56:13.341 --> 01:56:15.844
Twenty-five thousand Marks apiece.

01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:17.721
And we can't find...

01:56:17.888 --> 01:56:19.473
...a piece of wire.

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:22.517
Some old wire worth 5O pennies.

01:56:25.312 --> 01:56:27.022
Periscope hydraulics jammed.

01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:29.357
Can't be moved manually, either.

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:33.862
Wire.

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.698
Finally, something.

01:56:36.865 --> 01:56:38.241
Pliers!

01:56:51.755 --> 01:56:53.173
Leaks stopped.

01:56:58.929 --> 01:57:00.013
Good, Johann.

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:06.269
Really good.

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:14.277
Now, get out of those wet rags.

01:57:25.121 --> 01:57:27.249
Now let's get it out.

01:57:27.415 --> 01:57:29.543
This water's got to go.

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:33.046
First, into the control room bilge...

01:57:33.922 --> 01:57:35.131
...and then out.

01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:44.140
Faster. Let's get rid of it.

01:57:52.941 --> 01:57:55.735
And scoop. And scoop.

01:58:00.323 --> 01:58:03.660
Get with it.
No falling asleep back there.

01:58:08.206 --> 01:58:10.333
Three cells starboard.

01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:23.138
Where do we stand?

01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:28.351
Almost done. Three cells to go.

01:58:31.521 --> 01:58:34.357
Make way for the chief.
Watch out!

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:50.624
Entire compass system is down...

01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:55.337
...probably the sonar too.

01:58:55.503 --> 01:58:57.088
Radio is totally out.

01:58:59.883 --> 01:59:01.635
Quite a mess.

01:59:04.346 --> 01:59:05.889
Can we surface?

01:59:11.853 --> 01:59:13.396
Any chance at all?

01:59:20.278 --> 01:59:22.489
Good question.

01:59:28.119 --> 01:59:31.081
Some air may be left
in the ballast tanks...

01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:33.708
...from all that blowing.

01:59:36.586 --> 01:59:38.338
That might help us.

01:59:38.588 --> 01:59:41.341
With every last bit of air pressure...

01:59:46.638 --> 01:59:48.098
...maybe--

01:59:52.394 --> 01:59:54.979
We've got to reduce our weight.

01:59:56.523 --> 01:59:58.858
That water has to get out.

02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:16.543
Might work. It just might!

02:00:19.713 --> 02:00:21.840
Aft is almost bailed.

02:00:29.806 --> 02:00:31.141
It could work...

02:00:31.307 --> 02:00:33.143
...by hand into tanks...

02:00:33.309 --> 02:00:34.602
...then with main bilge pump...

02:00:34.769 --> 02:00:37.605
...and air pressure,
the water's pushed out.

02:00:37.772 --> 02:00:39.566
Main bilge pump?

02:00:40.275 --> 02:00:41.901
Can do.

02:00:45.822 --> 02:00:48.074
Then we go for broke.

02:00:49.576 --> 02:00:51.161
Blow tanks, and--

02:00:52.787 --> 02:00:54.664
We'll get only one try.

02:00:56.833 --> 02:00:58.001
When?

02:00:58.168 --> 02:01:00.336
Once everything's repaired.

02:01:00.503 --> 02:01:02.297
In 6 to 8 hours.

02:01:04.424 --> 02:01:07.343
- CO2 content?
-1.8 percent.

02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:10.180
We got enough oxygen?

02:01:10.847 --> 02:01:12.182
No.

02:01:15.143 --> 02:01:17.854
Pass out oxygen masks as needed...

02:01:18.021 --> 02:01:19.981
...men off duty to their bunks.

02:02:28.675 --> 02:02:30.093
How's he doing?

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.011
Hard to tell.

02:02:57.495 --> 02:02:58.621
All right here?

02:02:58.788 --> 02:03:01.124
Okay. Doing fine.

02:03:06.462 --> 02:03:10.258
Sure, captain. It'll work out.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.100
How's it going?

02:03:21.644 --> 02:03:24.814
Two. Got to change two more bearings.

02:04:16.991 --> 02:04:18.576
Do you want some glucose?

02:04:59.742 --> 02:05:01.327
Crazy idea...

02:05:02.453 --> 02:05:04.831
...to ram us through this strait.

02:05:06.249 --> 02:05:08.459
It was bound to go wrong.

02:05:13.715 --> 02:05:15.717
He knew it.

02:05:17.385 --> 02:05:20.221
That old fox knew it all along.

02:05:25.309 --> 02:05:29.105
Since he got that radiogram...

02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:32.483
...ordering us to break through.

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:38.990
That's why
he wanted us off the boat...

02:05:39.157 --> 02:05:40.867
...in Vigo.

02:05:45.788 --> 02:05:48.875
There was no chance to get through.

02:06:04.599 --> 02:06:08.644
He wanted to make us believe
it was possible...

02:06:09.353 --> 02:06:11.064
...with a simple trick.

02:06:15.610 --> 02:06:19.447
"Drop down and glide through"--

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:26.954
Not a bad trick...

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:31.751
...except that it had to work.

02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:42.553
Will we ever surface, chief?

02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:52.730
I don't know.

02:07:42.697 --> 02:07:44.365
I'm sorry.

02:07:46.534 --> 02:07:48.619
Is it hopeless?

02:07:52.373 --> 02:07:55.168
It's been 15 hours.

02:08:03.301 --> 02:08:05.136
He's not going to pull it off.

02:08:27.742 --> 02:08:29.368
I'm sorry.

02:08:38.127 --> 02:08:40.588
I asked for it.

02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:50.264
"To be heading into the inexorable...

02:08:52.016 --> 02:08:56.437
...where no mother will care for us...

02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:01.359
...no woman crosses our path...

02:09:02.818 --> 02:09:07.281
...where only reality reigns,
with cruelty and grandeur."

02:09:18.626 --> 02:09:21.128
I was drunk with those words.

02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:30.888
Well, this is reality.

02:10:21.939 --> 02:10:24.150
Reporting to the captain.

02:10:28.988 --> 02:10:30.823
Electric motor fixed.

02:10:32.116 --> 02:10:34.410
Main bilge pump fixed.

02:10:34.869 --> 02:10:37.163
Water can be pumped into tanks...

02:10:39.206 --> 02:10:42.251
...then blown out
with compressed air.

02:10:43.377 --> 02:10:45.379
Compass ready.

02:10:46.464 --> 02:10:48.341
Sonar ready.

02:11:04.648 --> 02:11:06.609
Good, chief.

02:11:22.249 --> 02:11:24.251
Take a rest now.

02:11:32.843 --> 02:11:35.221
Still got a few small problems.

02:12:21.058 --> 02:12:23.644
All you need is good people.

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:29.525
Good people.

02:12:33.946 --> 02:12:35.489
Listen up.

02:12:38.993 --> 02:12:41.162
We're going to blow tanks now...

02:12:41.745 --> 02:12:44.373
...to see if we can lift our butt.

02:12:47.835 --> 02:12:49.044
If we do...

02:12:50.004 --> 02:12:52.256
...it might get uncomfortable again.

02:12:54.383 --> 02:12:56.427
Lots of traffic up there.

02:13:01.765 --> 02:13:03.517
So all we can do...

02:13:04.477 --> 02:13:06.896
...is pray those diesels start up.

02:13:08.272 --> 02:13:10.900
Then full speed ahead
and off we go...

02:13:11.525 --> 02:13:13.527
...out of this crater...

02:13:14.403 --> 02:13:16.280
...and back home.

02:13:18.032 --> 02:13:19.533
If it works...

02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:23.537
...half a bottle of beer for everyone.

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.252
We just might get lucky.

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:35.007
They're not expecting us.

02:13:42.556 --> 02:13:44.099
Well, men...

02:13:46.477 --> 02:13:48.145
...are we ready?

02:13:53.526 --> 02:13:55.319
Contact bearings?

02:13:55.486 --> 02:13:56.779
No contact.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:00.282
Prepare to surface,
rescue gear ready.

02:14:00.449 --> 02:14:02.159
Switch to red lights.

02:14:04.286 --> 02:14:05.996
Man your diving stations.

02:14:31.272 --> 02:14:32.856
Blow tanks.

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:49.683
Boat rising!

02:15:51.727 --> 02:15:53.937
Quiet men! Calm down!

02:16:04.865 --> 02:16:06.617
270 meters.

02:16:08.744 --> 02:16:10.579
First watch, get ready.

02:16:11.372 --> 02:16:13.332
260 meters.

02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:21.924
250 meters.

02:16:30.808 --> 02:16:32.643
240 meters.

02:16:38.649 --> 02:16:40.526
230 meters.

02:16:45.989 --> 02:16:47.783
220.

02:17:28.115 --> 02:17:29.742
Hatch is open.

02:17:43.714 --> 02:17:45.424
How about the engines?

02:17:50.846 --> 02:17:52.264
Both diesels.

02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:56.143
Now everything hinges on this.

02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:23.253
I think...

02:18:23.504 --> 02:18:25.506
...it's running!

02:18:25.672 --> 02:18:28.759
Who says you can't make something
out of nothing?

02:18:50.739 --> 02:18:52.616
They won't get us this time.

02:18:52.783 --> 02:18:54.284
Not again!

02:18:57.913 --> 02:19:00.499
Hang in there, damn it.

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:02.793
Hang in there!

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:06.797
Three degrees to starboard.
Course 320 degrees.

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:09.800
There he goes again!

02:19:14.388 --> 02:19:16.598
They don't notice us.

02:19:16.765 --> 02:19:19.768
They're all asleep in their bunks.

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:25.941
No, you know what?

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.695
They're at the casino,
celebrating our sinking!

02:19:32.614 --> 02:19:36.451
<i>Not yet, Kameraden! Not ye“!</i>

02:20:15.532 --> 02:20:19.328
Cheers, guys!
Here's to getting home!

02:20:57.699 --> 02:21:00.160
As long as the diesels hold up...

02:21:03.622 --> 02:21:05.874
...and with a little bit of luck...

02:21:11.046 --> 02:21:13.298
...we'll make it home.

02:21:29.564 --> 02:21:34.069
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
our returning sailors.

02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:08.437
All engines stop.

02:22:08.603 --> 02:22:09.938
Let go aft line.

02:22:18.655 --> 02:22:23.994
We Build For Victory!

02:22:35.964 --> 02:22:38.508
- Thanks, Hinrich.
- Don't mention it.

02:22:38.675 --> 02:22:40.469
The sun's shining.

02:22:40.635 --> 02:22:42.262
Lift it!

02:22:56.151 --> 02:22:58.612
All right? Almost there.
