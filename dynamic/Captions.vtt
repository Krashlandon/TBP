00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:04.136
<i> (Marnie) Two years ago,</i>

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.655
<i> before I even knew</i>
<i> I was a witch,</i>

00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:09.691
<i> that was the last time</i>
<i> I was in Halloweentown.</i>

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.480
<i> My mom Gwen,</i>

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.915
<i> my grandma Aggie,</i>

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.450
<i> my sister Sophie</i>

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:21.353
<i> and my brother Dylan and I</i>
<i> all had to join together</i>

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.306
<i> and use the power</i>
<i> of the Cromwell witch family</i>

00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:26.741
<i> to defeat Kalabar,</i>
<i> an evil warlock</i>

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:31.180
<i> who's had a thing for my mother</i>
<i> since they were teenagers.</i>

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:35.768
<i> Halloweentown</i>
<i> was always a happy place</i>

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.803
<i> where creatures</i>
<i> of different sizes</i>

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.656
<i> and shapes and species -</i>

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.025
<i> some of them</i>
<i> downright weird -</i>

00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:47.028
<i> could live apart</i>
<i> from the real world</i>
<i> in peace and harmony.</i>

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.866
<i> So, after we saved</i>
<i> Halloweentown,</i>

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:55.420
<i> Grandma decided</i>
<i> to leave her comfy house there</i>

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.106
<i> and live with our family</i>
<i> in the mortal world.</i>

00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:02.644
<i> Now it's</i>
<i> Halloween night again,</i>

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.646
<i> the only night</i>
<i> we can pass freely</i>

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:07.999
<i> between Halloweentown</i>
<i> and our world.</i>

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.420
<i> I'm thinking</i>
<i> about Halloweentown.</i>

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:13.755
<i> I wonder how it's changed.</i>

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:23.581
<i> Grandma says things</i>
<i> in Halloweentown</i>
<i> are always changing.</i>

00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:30.105
<i> I know nothing has changed</i>
<i> at our house.</i>

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:35.160
Mom and Grandma
are fighting again.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.579
<i> (female computer voice)</i>
<i> What's going on</i>
<i> at your party?</i>

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.415
Ehh... I'm avoiding it.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.265
<i> Why?</i>
<i> What's the matter?</i>

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.368
<i> (Sophie)</i> Marnie,
Grandma wants you
to come down.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.404
<i> (â™ª rock) </i>

00:02:02.406 --> 00:02:04.506
One per customer,
please.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.379
Yes, we have hats
for everybody.

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.581
Everybody, now, don't...

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.516
Don't fight. No fighting.
Witches don't fight.

00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:18.553
Oh, now, if you're going to be
real witches and warlocks,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.222
we need brooms, too, right?

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.226
Here we go.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:34.553
Ooh! Magic, magic,
brooms, brooms.
There you are, dear.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.472
You got here just
at the right time,
Marnie.

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:41.476
Now, perhaps
you'd like to take
our little partygoers

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.478
for a little spin
around the house.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.932
Grandma, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.167
What? Oh, fiddle.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.969
I can't let your mother

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.604
spoil my fun
every day of the year.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.373
Mother.
Oh, hello,
dear.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.375
I spend all of my time
trying to keep you

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.377
from turning
my own daughters
against me.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.746
Now you're gonna
corrupt all the children
in the neighborhood.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.082
Mom, we're not turning
against you.

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:08.320
My dear, if you want
to reject your heritage,
that's your business,

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.322
but someone
has to take my place

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:13.008
as head
of the Cromwell line,

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.962
and I know Marnie
is just the stuff.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:19.230
Or me.
I'd be good, too.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.932
That's right.
That's right.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.367
All right,
dress-up's over.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.869
We've got
bobbing for apples
right over there.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.871
<i> (children groaning)</i>
Oh, yes, it's fun.
It's fun. Go play.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.207
Well, I hope
you're happy.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.943
Oh, ecstatic.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.116
I'll take Grandma.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.325
<i> (woman) Hey, Gort,</i>
<i> are you home?</i>

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.160
<i> (gruff voice)</i>
<i> What do you want?</i>
<i> Hi, Gort.</i>

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:50.996
<i> I'm asking everyone</i>
<i> for a small donation</i>

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.098
<i> for the Halloweentown school.</i>

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.766
<i> Forget it, Astrid.</i>

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.902
<i> I don't give to charity.</i>

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.673
Astrid, you're forever
the optimist.

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.174
That's Gort, right?

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.177
He's the one
who steals the socks?

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.347
Oh, he doesn't
steal them.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.350
He's more like
a junk magnet.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.687
Everything in the universe
that gets lost -

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.022
that other sock,

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:19.657
the last piece
of the jigsaw puzzle,

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.144
the earring you put down
for just a second -

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:27.182
they all end up
in Gort's front yard.

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:31.586
Not that he's willing
to part with any of it.

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:33.872
<i> (jingling sound) </i>

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.774
Oh, look, there's Benny.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.712
Why don't you go back
to Halloweentown tonight
while the portal's open?

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.880
I know you miss
Astrid and Benny

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.883
and all your friends there.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.334
<i> (chuckles) </i>

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:53.442
After a year away, going back
for just a few hours...

00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:56.411
is harder
than not going back at all.

00:04:56.413 --> 00:04:59.915
No, I'll just wait
till next Halloween,

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:02.717
and then I can take Marnie
for the year.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.719
But won't a year
in Halloweentown

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.822
feel like 100 years
to her?

00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:12.844
Oh, becoming the head
of the Cromwell witches
takes commitment, Sophie.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.979
She can't live in both worlds.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.015
She has to choose.

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:19.951
Ohh, look, look, look.
There's Luke.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.521
Oh, he's becoming
a fine young goblin,
hasn't he?

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.590
Look, look. H...

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.210
What's the matter, dear?

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:31.245
Somebody's coming.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.515
Who?

00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:35.566
I don't know.

00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:39.354
Come on.
Well, I... I...

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:41.689
Do you think
it could be someone...

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.142
I didn't invite anyo...
Come on, Grandma.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.994
Hide.

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.264
And do the thingy
with your door.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.816
It's not supposed to be there
when we have guests.

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.002
Ohh, your mother's rules.

00:05:57.474 --> 00:06:00.992
Mom.
What?

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:04.996
I... I'm not
turning against you.

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.898
I love you.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.102
But I'm a witch.

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.720
I can't just not be.

00:06:11.722 --> 00:06:13.888
I'm sorry
that I got mad at you.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.958
It's just so frustrating.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.377
I want you to learn
what I know, too.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.863
Magic can give you
whatever you wish for,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:24.933
but nothing's worth anything
if you can get it
just by wishing.

00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:27.218
That's what your dad taught me.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.121
But I don't use magic
for everything.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.057
I don't use it on tests.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.160
All right. There was
that one algebra test...

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.196
Marnie,
you can't pick and choose.

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:41.182
If you go to Halloweentown
for a year, that's gonna
become your life.

00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:43.318
You're a stranger in this world
after that.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.152
Knock, knock.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.675
The bomb.

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:54.579
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.049
Dad, I found 'em.<font color="#ffff00"> </font>

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.538
Hi, I'm Alex.
This is my son Cal.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.539
We just moved in
down the street,

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:06.558
and we heard
about your party.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.543
Oh, well, welcome
to the neighborhood.

00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:11.245
I'm Gwen, and this
is my daughter Marnie.

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:12.697
Hi.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.999
If all witches were
as pretty as you,

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.719
they'd have
a better reputation.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.573
Oh. Thanks.

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:23.575
Can I put those
in the freezer for you?

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:26.778
Whatever you want.
They're for you.
Uh, for the party.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.881
I hope you like lime.
Green's my favorite color.

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:31.216
OK.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:35.486
Is the rest of your family
coming, too?

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.772
Oh, it's just me and Cal.

00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:41.509
Oh. Well, lime is good.

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.829
Good.
I've got some scoops
over here.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.297
Let me help you.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.717
<i> (whispers)</i>
Rrarr!

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.719
That's Cindy.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.038
Yeah.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.040
Well, it's a little crowded
in here.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.411
You wanna give me a tour?
Sure.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.413
Let's go this way.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.686
This is it.

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.422
So, um,
when did you move in?

00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:12.156
Just tonight, actually.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:16.528
Really? And your dad
let you come to our party?
Don't you have to unpack?

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.564
No. My dad doesn't
waste his breath
on stuff like that.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.166
He lets me figure it out
myself.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.541
Uh, so has anyone asked you
to go with them

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:31.643
to the costume party
at the high school?

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.531
Why? Did you want
to ask me?

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:38.199
Well, that depends

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:40.702
on whether or not
that would be ridiculous.

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:43.572
Dylan, you're not
even wearing a costume.

00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:47.509
Oh. Well, I'm not
really into the whole
Halloween thing.

00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:50.177
But that's the whole point
of the party.

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.196
Most disgusting costume
wins a prize

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.132
after the unmasking
at midnight.

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.017
Might that prize
be a kiss?

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:57.519
That's disgusting.

00:08:57.521 --> 00:09:01.339
<i> (laughs) </i>

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.341
<i> (Marnie)</i>
When we moved in last year,

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:05.710
I finally got my own room.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.729
<i> (Cal)</i> Huh.
What?

00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:09.264
Oh, I don't know.

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:12.133
It's just, usually
people's rooms look like 'em.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.851
Yours doesn't.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.838
What do you mean?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.675
Well, you strike me
as unconventional,
but in a good way.

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:26.531
Yeah, well, my room
is kind of ordinary.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:31.336
My mom likes ordinary,
I guess.
Oh, she's the boss, huh?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.876
Well, there is
my grandma's room.

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:40.478
Why? What's hers like?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.414
I'll show you.

00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:52.107
Was that there before?

00:09:52.109 --> 00:09:53.975
Shh.

00:09:53.977 --> 00:09:56.411
This is a secret.

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.237
Wow.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.740
This is so cool.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.875
Does she do it like this
every Halloween?

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:13.912
She's very into
the whole witch thing.

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:17.481
Um, stories, I mean,
about witches.

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.951
Yeah, I guess so.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:23.287
"Hair of werewolf."

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.789
This must not be easy
to get.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.457
It wasn't, believe m...

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.979
Um, I mean, in the old days
of fairy tales.

00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:33.998
Oh. So you know about
this witch stuff, too.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.167
A little.

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:38.018
Do you know any magic spells?

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.523
Well, sure, but they're
pretend ones, of course.

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:44.926
See, there are common spells
that every witch knows -

00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:47.629
I mean, supposedly -

00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.081
and then there are
the really secret ones

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.950
that are only known
to the witch who made them up.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:55.486
Or warlock.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.922
That's what male witches
are called, right? Warlocks?

00:10:57.924 --> 00:11:00.357
So you've been doing
some reading, too.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.643
Just movies and stuff,

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:04.762
but they're not really
that educational.

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:08.349
Well, Grandma feels like
witches are misunderstood,

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:11.835
so she likes
to teach us about them.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:14.889
Whoa. Is that supposed
to be a book of spells?

00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:16.624
No.

00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:18.409
I mean...

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:23.013
yes, that's what
it's<i> supposed</i> to be,

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.450
but you can't touch it.

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.985
Oh, come on.
It's just pretend, right?

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:31.172
Well, sure, but it's still
my grandma's stuff,

00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:36.010
and we
really shouldn't be in here
when she's not here, so I...

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:39.547
OK.

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:40.982
So, you like ice cream?

00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:43.051
Sure.

00:11:43.053 --> 00:11:46.137
All right.

00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:09.577
Oh, thanks.
Do you want some,
son?

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.646
Actually, I think
I'm gonna head home, Dad.

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.315
I think
I'll stay around here
and help out...

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.819
If that's OK.
Oh, I never turn down help.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:21.122
Hey, Marnie,
I'm not enrolled yet,

00:12:21.124 --> 00:12:24.726
but I hear there's this
really big costume party
at the high school.

00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:27.979
I figured if my costume's
good enough,
maybe I could crash it.

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.247
Well, let's see.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.716
If you went with a student
who is enrolled,

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:35.686
then maybe you wouldn't
have to crash it.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.004
Pick you up in an hour?

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:40.341
Yeah, sure.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.043
<i> (whispers)</i> Yes!

00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:46.047
Meeting you is everything
I hoped it would be.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.478
I don't see anyone.

00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:10.321
<i> (reciting spell) </i>

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.004
And one for you.

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.005
Ooh.

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:31.943
And one for you,
and...

00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:34.078
Where's mine?

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.549
It's empty.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.452
Well, dear,
it's always empty.

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:44.055
That's why it's magic
when we pull things
out of it.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:47.424
Grandma, there's nothing
in there, not even by magic.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:49.426
Well, that's impossible.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:55.233
Oh. Oh, well,
I'm sorry, kids.

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:59.354
I guess... I guess
that<i> is</i> all there is.

00:13:59.356 --> 00:14:02.256
Just my luck.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.091
Well, I can't...

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:07.495
I've had this for centuries.

00:14:07.497 --> 00:14:10.264
It's never been empty
before.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.100
Empty?
Well, it's no wonder.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.035
Every day for two years,

00:14:15.037 --> 00:14:17.938
pulling out bat games,
dancing skeletons,
enchanted toads,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.040
back issues
of<i> Magic Monthly...</i>

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:23.143
And, hey,
let's not forget the ogre
with the flatulence problem.

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:25.913
Stinky. I miss him.

00:14:25.915 --> 00:14:28.349
It just can't run out.

00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:31.853
It's connected to my house
back in Halloweentown

00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:35.106
with all my charms
and all my spells.

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:38.910
Oh, perhaps I should
just pop back up
to Halloweentown,

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:41.645
just... just to look
at my house.

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:43.147
Can I go? Can I go?

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:45.149
Oh, forget it, Sophie.

00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:47.351
Mom already put
the big foot down.

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.819
None of us can go.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:52.239
Well, perhaps if I said
that I need your help

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:54.425
with a technical
problem.

00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:57.378
I'll get my coat.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.396
This'll never work.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.666
Oh, no, let me
do the talking, dear.

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:04.935
I'll use my utmost
powers of persuasion.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:06.537
<i> (chuckles) </i>

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:08.272
It'll work.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:12.710
And here I thought
we were going to avoid
the annual family meltdown.

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:14.462
Ha.

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.998
...what we're made of,
do you know what I mean?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.301
I do. Just the other day,
I was saying to my daughter...

00:15:20.303 --> 00:15:23.037
Honey, I'm taking the girls out
for a little while.
Is that all right?

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.039
Sure, Mom.
Just make sure...

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.257
Wait. Out where?

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:30.027
Oh, just home.
We'll be back
in a jiffy.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:36.333
Oh, how do you do?
I'm Aggie, Gwen's mother.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:37.501
Nice to meet you.

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.003
I'm Alex.
Mother...

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:42.006
Marnie's going to be
staying with me
for a whole year

00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.075
after she gets
out of high school.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:46.810
Isn't that fabulous?

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.079
How lucky for her.

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:51.049
Yes, and Sophie
is going to stay
with me.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.950
Mom!

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.452
Sweetheart,
it's your bedtime.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.720
Why don't you go upstairs
and start getting ready?

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:05.629
We'll be back soon, Mom.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.665
Don't worry.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:08.832
OK?

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.939
You see? Your mother
can be reasonable.

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:17.942
We should have a stranger there
for all our family discussions.

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:20.178
If she wants to check on us,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.082
you tell her to call me
on my head phone.

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:25.783
You mean cell phone.

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.285
Head phone.

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.286
Ew!

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:29.954
What good
are those things?

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.523
Well, they're a little bit
like your walkie-talkies...

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:34.692
<i> (whispers)</i>
except they work like magic.

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.261
<i> (Aggie's voice)</i>
<i> Except they work like magic.</i>
Ohh!

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.863
They can even be used
to communicate

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.700
between the mortal world
and Halloweentown.

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:44.535
I invented them myself.

00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:46.237
Aren't they cute?

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:48.239
Anyway, it probably
won't be a problem,

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.741
because you know
we're gonna be home
<i> before</i> midnight.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:54.428
We'll be back in an hour,
because I have a date.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.148
And I've never understood

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.384
why you bother
with that Internet thing

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:04.956
when my witch's glass
can show you anything
you want to know.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:11.629
Wait. Isn't this
where the bus stop's
supposed to be?

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:15.449
Oh, Arnold must have forgot
to put the thing out again.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.486
I swear, that man
would lose his head

00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:21.489
if his wife didn't put it
in his lunchbox.

00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:22.890
<i> (laughs) </i>

00:17:22.892 --> 00:17:25.526
Well...
I'll summon the bus.

00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:26.927
Good.

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:28.862
Ahem.

00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:31.765
<i> Gestum ex alius mundus</i>

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:37.721
<i> nos te appello</i>
<i> ut adduco domus!</i>

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.990
Didn't I say it right?

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.693
Try it again
with more feeling.

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:43.761
OK.

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.463
Ahem.

00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:48.131
<i> Gestum ex alius mundus</i>

00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:58.742
Well, I guess we'll
just have to call up
the portal ourselves.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:04.048
<i> (both)</i> From the mortal world

back into Halloweentown.

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:12.022
Through the portal
we take our leave.

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.659
Four hours till midnight.

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:19.496
We'll be back
in plenty of time.

00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:37.114
Has anyone ever told you
you have the most beautiful
green eyes?

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.415
<i> (laughing) </i>

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.434
They're like two lily pads

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:42.569
floating
on a crystal-clear lake.

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:46.858
Look, I don't want
to be too forward,

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.744
but would you consider
being my date for
the costume party?

00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:51.846
At the high school?
Yeah.

00:18:51.848 --> 00:18:54.214
That's just
for the students.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.318
Oh, I'm sure they can
always use more chaperones.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.405
Hey, it'll give me an excuse
to see you again.

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:03.807
Well, I don't even have
a costume.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.344
Oh, that's all right.
Cal's got loads of stuff
back at the house.

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:09.230
I'm sure we can
find you something.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:12.315
All right. Sure.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.835
I'd like that.

00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:18.289
Great. Well... till then.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.357
Till then.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.597
I was just curious.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:31.368
Thanks for stopping by.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.970
Ribbit.

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:34.271
Ribbit.

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:37.174
Ribbit.
Same to you.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.094
<i> (croaking) </i>

00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:53.090
Oh, it feels so good
to be back.

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:56.827
Sophie was right.
I needed to come home.

00:19:56.829 --> 00:19:59.863
I've been missing my friends
terribly.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:05.152
Where's
the big jack-o'-lantern?

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.341
Is this some kind of joke?

00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:12.543
As goes the jack-o'-lantern,

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.645
so goes Halloweentown.

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:21.802
Grandma,
what's happened?

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:26.157
Everything's kind of gray
and boring.

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:29.660
Not just everything.
Everybody.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:30.927
Wait, please.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.397
Could you tell me
what's happening here?

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:38.219
I would just like...
Astrid, is that you?

00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:40.838
I'm Astrid.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.774
Astrid, what's happened
to you?

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:46.359
What do you mean?

00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:48.796
Well, I mean,
you're turning gray

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:51.315
and your bell-bottoms
are gone.

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:54.484
And your shoes. Ooh!

00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:58.505
These are very comfortable.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.241
Sensible shoes are important.

00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:03.377
I think I'll buy some more.

00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:05.613
Ohh, Astrid.

00:21:05.615 --> 00:21:07.915
Oh, excuse me.

00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:09.600
I was talking.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.369
Whatever.

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.937
Oh, I hate that word.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.340
Wait a minute.

00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:17.941
Dear...

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.627
Do I know you?

00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:22.713
Duh.

00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:25.883
It can't be. Luke?

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:27.752
Yeah.

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:30.003
But you look just like you did

00:21:30.005 --> 00:21:34.074
when Kalabar put that spell
on you and turned you human.

00:21:34.076 --> 00:21:38.095
Whatever.

00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:39.697
Would you stop that?

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.765
Look, what is going on?

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.701
Why are you turning gray?

00:21:43.703 --> 00:21:46.186
Everybody's doing it.

00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:48.205
That's not what I mean.

00:21:48.207 --> 00:21:50.107
It's the spell, dear.

00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:51.475
A spell?

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.811
You think someone put a spell
on all of Halloweentown?

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.246
How could they do that?

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:58.815
I'm not sure.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:02.252
But the spell seems
to be turning the creatures

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:05.222
not only gray,

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:09.477
but once it progresses
far enough, into humans.

00:22:09.479 --> 00:22:10.945
Come on, Grandma.

00:22:10.947 --> 00:22:12.746
Humans aren't<i> this</i> boring.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:14.849
No.

00:22:14.851 --> 00:22:18.652
I should say this is
the caricature of humans

00:22:18.654 --> 00:22:20.804
in Halloweentown,

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.123
just as humans make fun of us

00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:25.776
from the mortal world
at Halloween.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:29.413
But who would cast
a spell like this?

00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:34.001
I don't know, but someone
is destroying my home.

00:22:34.003 --> 00:22:37.805
OK, let's not get upset.

00:22:37.807 --> 00:22:40.474
Undoing spells
isn't that hard, right?

00:22:40.476 --> 00:22:42.543
You just say 'em backwards.

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:45.229
I remember...
I remember something
from my spell book.

00:22:45.231 --> 00:22:46.714
It was a spell...

00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:50.851
Well, I haven't looked at it
in years,

00:22:50.853 --> 00:22:52.686
but it was similar to this.

00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:55.723
Well, great. Then maybe
the spell in your book
can cure it.

00:22:55.725 --> 00:22:57.775
It's worth a try.

00:22:57.777 --> 00:23:01.879
Dylan? Dylan?
Oh, Dylan.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:04.314
Are you there?
Can you hear me?

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:07.234
Dylan, will you
please answer this?

00:23:07.236 --> 00:23:08.452
<i> Dylan, can you hear me?</i>

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:11.555
<i> Dylan, are you there?</i>

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:14.458
<i> Dylan, will you</i>
<i> please answer me?</i>

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.892
All right, I hear you.
What do you want?

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:19.396
I want you
to go into my room
and read me a spell

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:22.083
<i> out of my book.</i>
Grandma, I'm busy.

00:23:22.085 --> 00:23:24.085
Oh! Oh...

00:23:24.087 --> 00:23:26.120
Just do it, Dylan,

00:23:26.122 --> 00:23:28.789
or I'll spam your diary
all over the Net.

00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:30.224
You don't know my password.

00:23:30.226 --> 00:23:31.258
Wanna bet,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.760
<i> Iron Buns?</i>

00:23:32.762 --> 00:23:34.327
Shh. OK, I'll do it.

00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:39.633
<i> (chuckles)</i> Iron Buns.

00:23:39.635 --> 00:23:43.687
I should have been
allowed to go, too.

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.089
Yeah. Just open the door.

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.111
We're in.

00:23:50.113 --> 00:23:52.012
Oh!

00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:54.248
Gotcha.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.901
Look, just find
the spell book, all right?

00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:01.221
It's not here.
<i> What do you mean,</i>
<i> it's not there?</i>

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:02.890
<i> It should be</i>
<i> on the table.</i>
Well, it's not.

00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:04.375
It has to be.

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:05.559
Maybe Grandma
misplaced it.

00:24:05.561 --> 00:24:07.061
Dylan, it's huge.

00:24:07.063 --> 00:24:09.396
How's she gonna
"misplace" it?

00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:11.799
She misplaced the ogre.

00:24:11.801 --> 00:24:14.552
Stinky liked playing
hide and seek.

00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:16.954
Someone must have taken it.

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:20.691
Did any of you go to my room
since I came down to the party?

00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:22.676
Not me.
Not me.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.950
Um, well, I was,
for a few minutes.

00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:32.486
Well, did someone
go in with you?

00:24:32.488 --> 00:24:34.921
Just this boy I met - Cal -

00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:38.659
but he couldn't have taken it,
'cause I was with him
the whole time.

00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:40.661
<i> He must be</i>
<i> the one I felt coming.</i>

00:24:40.663 --> 00:24:42.329
He stole it, Grandma.

00:24:42.331 --> 00:24:44.331
It could have been
somebody else.

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:46.500
I mean, we've been gone
for almost an hour.

00:24:46.502 --> 00:24:49.303
Well, only
you, Grandma and Sophie
know the spell to get in.

00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:51.938
Children, you seal my room.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.941
I'm going to go back
and have a talk

00:24:53.943 --> 00:24:55.976
with Marnie's new friend.

00:25:04.987 --> 00:25:07.404
He wouldn't steal anything,
Grandma.

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:09.773
He's really sweet.

00:25:09.775 --> 00:25:13.877
Perhaps, but for the moment,
he's our only suspect.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.896
Mm.

00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:20.867
<i> (both)</i> From Halloweentown
depart we now,

00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:24.604
on this, the night,
All Hallow's Eve,

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:27.174
back into the mortal world.

00:25:27.176 --> 00:25:29.410
Through the portal
we take our leave.

00:25:33.315 --> 00:25:36.016
The... the portal
won't open.

00:25:36.018 --> 00:25:37.851
Oh, it's just as I feared.

00:25:37.853 --> 00:25:40.921
Whoever cast this Gray Spell
knew it would affect
my suitcase

00:25:40.923 --> 00:25:42.923
and knew we'd come
to investigate.

00:25:42.925 --> 00:25:44.441
It was a trap.

00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:46.776
<i> (Cal)</i> Very good, Aggie.

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.812
You're keeping up nicely.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:50.480
Cal?

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:52.849
Over here.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.287
Cal?

00:25:56.289 --> 00:25:59.189
You cast the spell
on Halloweentown?

00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:03.827
Just the way it was written
in Aggie's little spell book.

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:05.195
You naughty girl.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:08.132
I knew it seemed
familiar.

00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:10.751
But... But then
you'd have to be a w...

00:26:10.753 --> 00:26:12.435
A warlock?

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.670
Sweet, huh?

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:17.224
So then that whole thing -
your so-called dad,

00:26:17.226 --> 00:26:20.360
the tour of the house -

00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:22.980
it was just to get the book.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:25.899
No, I could have
stolen the book anytime.

00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:28.118
See, I wanted you
to show it to me

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.703
because you felt something
between us,

00:26:30.705 --> 00:26:32.356
and you did.

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:35.442
You tricked me.

00:26:35.444 --> 00:26:37.044
Ha. You'll get over it.

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:40.897
And, hey, I still need a date
to the costume party.

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:43.266
Forget the party.

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.569
I wanna know why...

00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:50.407
Kalabar.

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:51.708
What did you say, dear?

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.994
The rose.

00:26:59.969 --> 00:27:03.103
You always did let your magic
do the talking.

00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:06.273
I should have known
when he gave me the rose.

00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:10.727
Cal.

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:13.063
You're Kalabar's son.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:17.868
And I guess I inherited
my father's attraction
to Cromwell witches.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.454
I didn't know
Kalabar had a child.

00:27:20.456 --> 00:27:23.123
He didn't want people
to know.

00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:25.242
Dad and I didn't always agree,

00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:28.228
but he was the only one
that stood in the way

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.581
of the Cromwells' domination
of Halloweentown.

00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:35.085
Oh, that's absurd.
The Cromwells dominate no one.

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:38.038
Then why'd you let the mortals
take charge of the earth

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.274
while we had to hide like rats
in another dimension?

00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:44.945
Oh, we all voted
to create our own world

00:27:44.947 --> 00:27:47.180
so everyone
could live in peace.

00:27:47.182 --> 00:27:50.283
And when my father tried
to bring the creatures
of Halloweentown

00:27:50.285 --> 00:27:53.419
back as rulers
of the human race,

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.590
you Cromwells
brought everyone against him,

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:58.742
and then you destroyed him!

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:01.144
So that's what this is about -

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.446
revenge.

00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:06.333
Just say the word,
and I'll open up the portal.

00:28:06.335 --> 00:28:08.285
Say what word?

00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:11.789
Stop doing everything
your mama tells you,

00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:15.809
and I can show you things
that Aggie could not teach you

00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:17.444
in a million years.

00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:19.046
Ha!

00:28:19.048 --> 00:28:22.515
I'm not interested
in your kind of magic.

00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:24.551
All you do is destroy.

00:28:24.553 --> 00:28:28.972
Oh, the Gray Spell
is just the first act, Marnie.

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:32.325
The finale will come at midnight
in the mortal world.

00:28:32.327 --> 00:28:34.444
What finale?

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.763
Join me and find out.

00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:38.315
No way.

00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:43.353
Well, you think about it,
and, uh...

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:45.305
catch ya later.

00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:52.996
I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:55.933
I really blew it.

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:59.102
We all make mistakes, dear,
but don't worry about it.

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:03.424
We'll show Cal the Cromwells
are not so easily beaten.

00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:06.092
But how? I mean,
we're trapped here,

00:29:06.094 --> 00:29:08.929
and... he's got
your spell book.

00:29:08.931 --> 00:29:12.900
Well, I still have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

00:29:12.902 --> 00:29:14.902
<i> (whistles) </i>

00:29:14.904 --> 00:29:16.904
First we have to get back
to my house.
<i> (â™ª electronic) </i>

00:29:16.906 --> 00:29:20.374
Oh, thank goodness.
The taxicab is still working.

00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:22.242
Oh, now, on the way,

00:29:22.244 --> 00:29:25.712
you can call your brother
and give him an update

00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:31.384
while we find a way
to break this accursed spell.

00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:33.353
Hmm?
OK.

00:29:38.327 --> 00:29:40.294
Benny?

00:29:40.296 --> 00:29:42.930
Wow! Ahh...

00:29:42.932 --> 00:29:44.465
Need a ride?
<i> (music dies) </i>

00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:48.569
Uh, Grandma,
I think it's Benny.

00:29:50.356 --> 00:29:52.956
<i> (Marnie)</i> Can you drive
any faster, Benny?

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.726
<i> (Aggie)</i> Relax, Marnie.
We've arrived.

00:29:55.728 --> 00:30:00.030
Wow. Turning gray
sure has made you
a careful driver, Benny.

00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:01.782
Have we met?

00:30:01.784 --> 00:30:03.934
Ohh...
Well, yeah,

00:30:03.936 --> 00:30:06.869
but the last time,
you were just
skin and bones,

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:09.239
except for the skin.

00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:12.543
Thank you for the ride, dear.
We're in something of a hurry.

00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:16.296
Come on, children,
let's get inside.

00:30:16.298 --> 00:30:19.466
What do you think
Cal's going to do
to the mortal world?

00:30:19.468 --> 00:30:22.903
Well, he clearly
shares his father's
hatred of humans,

00:30:22.905 --> 00:30:25.639
but if he's willing
to break the Code of Merlin,

00:30:25.641 --> 00:30:29.476
which forbids stealing
the spells of another,

00:30:29.478 --> 00:30:32.913
then I think
that we can safely assume
that he's capable of anything.

00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:35.516
Now no more talk
until we're inside,

00:30:35.518 --> 00:30:37.951
and even if
he's still eavesdropping,

00:30:37.953 --> 00:30:40.453
he won't be able to hear us
in my house.

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:42.956
I hope the Gray Spell
hasn't changed an...

00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:45.592
<i> (gasp)</i> ...anything.

00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:46.543
Ohh.

00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:53.533
I like what you've done
with the place.

00:30:53.535 --> 00:30:58.071
I can't believe Cal did this
with a spell out of your book.

00:30:58.073 --> 00:30:59.939
We'll never undo it.

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:01.975
Oh, I'd agree with you, dear,

00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:05.145
if there was only one copy
of my spell book.

00:31:05.147 --> 00:31:08.748
But what he doesn't know
is there are two.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.751
Two?

00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:13.520
They're matched sets,
two complete copies.

00:31:13.522 --> 00:31:16.623
I took the one I usually use
to the mortal world with me,

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:19.526
and the other one is still here.

00:31:19.528 --> 00:31:22.529
Someplace.

00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:26.233
Well, then,
let's look for it.
Oh, let's. Let's.

00:31:26.235 --> 00:31:28.485
<i> (high-pitched voice)</i> OK, yes.
<i> (high-pitched voice)</i>
Is it in there?

00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:29.853
No. Excuse me. Excu...

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:32.656
OK. Uh, no...

00:31:32.658 --> 00:31:34.190
OK, maybe...
Oh, this is it.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.959
No. Aah!

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:40.130
<i> (normal voice)</i>
You can help out, you know.

00:31:40.132 --> 00:31:42.398
I'm kinda hungry.
Ohh!

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.251
I wonder if there's anything
to eat around here.

00:31:45.253 --> 00:31:46.769
<i> (both, high-pitched voices)</i> Oh!

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:49.473
Maybe it's in here.
Maybe it's in here.

00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:53.043
It's gotta be here.
I know it is.
<i> (normal voice)</i> It's not here.

00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:55.545
<i> (sighs) </i>

00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:57.864
How about that one?
No, that's not it.

00:31:57.866 --> 00:31:59.850
That's not it.
That's too small.

00:31:59.852 --> 00:32:02.269
How about this? This?
It's just a big...
it's a big book.

00:32:02.271 --> 00:32:04.254
No. OK.
Oh, my goodness.

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:06.523
Then some of these.
Here, here. I know.
Here. This is it.

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:08.591
We can't find it.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:11.728
Grandma,
we can't just give up.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.230
There's gotta be something
we haven't thought of, right?

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:16.933
I mean, something
to get us out of this trap,

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:18.985
a spell or...
<i> (whooshing sound) </i>

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:24.507
Luke!
Yeah.

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.943
Look!
You're a goblin again.

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:29.046
Something broke the spell.

00:32:29.048 --> 00:32:30.714
I guess so.

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:34.250
Well, what happened, Grandma?
Did you say something?

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:36.219
Not that I'm aware of.

00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:38.588
Then how come
I'm not gray anymore?

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.892
Hmm. I suppose the spell
could be temporary.

00:32:41.894 --> 00:32:45.561
Then maybe the spell
on the house will wear off,

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:47.698
and we can find
your spell book.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.701
But if takes too long,
midnight will pass,
and the mortal world...

00:32:50.703 --> 00:32:53.203
Grandma, you already said
the spell book isn't here.

00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:54.705
What else can we do?

00:32:54.707 --> 00:32:57.707
Well, I haven't seen
that other spell book
for decades.

00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:03.613
Perhaps it's lost.

00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:05.899
Grandma,
why are you smiling?

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:07.501
That's terrible.

00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:11.037
No, no, dear, not at all,
because, you see, if it's lost,

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:13.940
I know just where it is.

00:33:13.942 --> 00:33:16.126
Wait. Gimme that again?

00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:19.196
<i> (chuckles)</i> Everything
that's lost in both worlds

00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:22.031
always ends up at Gort's house.

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:24.134
He's the junk man
of the universe.

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:25.986
Ohh! Excuse me.

00:33:25.988 --> 00:33:31.924
<i> (engine running) </i>

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:34.861
Your receipt.
Mail it, dear.

00:33:34.863 --> 00:33:39.165
Great, Benny.
OK, now to Gort's house,
and step on it.

00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:52.212
You should see him
when he's<i> not</i> in a hurry.

00:33:55.734 --> 00:34:00.003
Good night.
Thank you so much
for coming. Bye.

00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:02.038
<i> (woman)</i>
Thanks very much.
<i> (girl)</i> Bye.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.041
Did Grandma ever consider
that she might have
misplaced the book?

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.542
I tried that.

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:09.012
Your grandmother thinks
everything's about magic.

00:34:09.014 --> 00:34:12.382
If she keeps this up,
you kids are never gonna
grow up to be normal people.

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.685
Grandma says being normal
is vastly overrated.

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:17.621
And you should
already be in bed.

00:34:17.623 --> 00:34:20.723
Marnie swears
this kid Cal is a warlock
and that he stole it,

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:24.160
and about his dad...
All right, that's enough.

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:27.664
OK, I think
that it would be a good idea
if everyone around here

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:30.667
started coming up with
simple explanations for things

00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:33.235
before they summoned up
the powers of darkness...
<i> (door opens) </i>

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:35.839
every time they're trying
to find their car keys.
<i> (door closes) </i>

00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:39.893
Now, Cal seems
like a very sweet
and charming young man

00:34:39.895 --> 00:34:41.561
and his father seems li...

00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:44.497
<i> (gasp)</i> Alex.

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.316
Hey, Gwen.

00:34:46.318 --> 00:34:48.184
Great costume, huh?

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.686
Hope I didn't scare you.

00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:52.204
Well, it is Halloween.
And, to celebrate,

00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:55.524
Cal and I found
a terrific mask for you.

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:57.760
Woo-ooo.

00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.162
Ew.

00:34:59.164 --> 00:35:02.031
Oh, it's...

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.800
You don't like it.

00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:06.870
Oh, no. It's... It's great.

00:35:06.872 --> 00:35:09.306
We are gonna be the hit
of the costume party.

00:35:09.308 --> 00:35:10.856
Oh, wait.

00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:13.225
You're going to
the Halloween party?

00:35:13.227 --> 00:35:15.428
Yes. Alex invited me,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.015
and... oh, Sophie.

00:35:19.017 --> 00:35:20.566
I get to go, too?

00:35:20.568 --> 00:35:22.902
Oh, no, sweetie.
You should already
be in bed.

00:35:22.904 --> 00:35:25.705
Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.

00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.557
Oh. Well, that's OK.

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:30.109
It's no big deal.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.496
You guys go.

00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:37.500
I'll baby-sit Sophie.
Dylan, no.

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:39.552
You've been looking forward
to this for weeks.

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:42.038
Let's face it, Mom.
I'm just not that
into Halloween.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.524
I mean, I was hoping for
a little social interaction,

00:35:44.526 --> 00:35:46.525
but you're the one
that's got the date.

00:35:46.527 --> 00:35:48.461
Did you ask Tiffany?
She was busy.

00:35:48.463 --> 00:35:50.046
Samantha?
Boyfriend.

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:53.149
Julia?
She laughed so hard that milk
came out of her nose.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.254
You guys go. You can
make it up to me later.

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:58.622
Are you sure?

00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:01.725
That is wonderful.
Shall we go?

00:36:01.727 --> 00:36:04.461
Sure. You're not gonna
give me warts, are you?

00:36:04.463 --> 00:36:07.430
That is a complete myth.

00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:08.965
Bed.

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:12.168
Don't make me laugh.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.457
Where'd
all the junk go?

00:36:17.459 --> 00:36:20.577
Looks like
Gort's been straightening up
ever since the Gray Spell hit.

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:23.146
Oh, you'd still better
prepare yourself, my dear.

00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:24.531
Spell or no spell,

00:36:24.533 --> 00:36:27.483
Gort the Rancorous
is still the foulest,

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:30.519
meanest, smelliest
inhabitant of Halloweentown.

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:35.558
<i> (nasal voice)</i> Yes?

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.426
Hello, Gort.

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:40.129
You're looking...
clean.

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.665
Um, do you need something?

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:46.402
I'm busy, you see,
sorting my socks.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:50.106
Uh, yes, Mr. Gort, sir.

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:52.208
We were looking for a book.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.694
Oh, I see.

00:36:54.696 --> 00:36:56.596
Well, come right in.

00:36:56.598 --> 00:36:59.832
I have several books.

00:36:59.834 --> 00:37:00.850
Yes.

00:37:10.412 --> 00:37:13.046
<i> (Gort)</i> Well, here they are.

00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:17.217
Oh, thank you, Gort.
<i> "Proper Toenail Cutting."</i>

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:20.453
<i> "Dusting</i>
<i> for Fun and Profit"?</i>

00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:23.189
<i> "100 Recipes</i>
<i> for Tapioca."</i>

00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:26.326
You know, I don't think
whoever lost these
is missing 'em.

00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:29.012
Gort, these can't be
all the books you've got.

00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.247
Well, I sold the rest

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:33.966
at the yard sale.

00:37:33.968 --> 00:37:35.718
Yard sale?

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.955
Oh, yes. This place
was very messy.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:41.757
I only kept
the useful books.

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:46.913
I'll sell these socks, too,
as soon as I match them up.

00:37:46.915 --> 00:37:49.416
Gort, there was
a particular book,

00:37:49.418 --> 00:37:51.951
an extra copy
of my spell book.

00:37:51.953 --> 00:37:54.253
Do you remember
who you sold it to?

00:38:01.663 --> 00:38:04.347
Do you think
these two match?

00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:10.086
No, I suppose not.

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:12.939
Well, we've hit
a dead end.

00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:15.675
You know, that book
could be anywhere.

00:38:15.677 --> 00:38:19.378
OK, I say we head back
to the mortal world.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.180
The spell -
it's coming back.

00:38:21.182 --> 00:38:22.882
Ohh.

00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:25.918
Grandma, wh...
what's happening?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.104
It's the Gray Spell.

00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:31.774
It's affecting me
now that we're in
Halloweentown.

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.277
It's probably gonna go
after you, too, dear.

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:36.246
We've gotta get out of here.

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:46.923
The door - it won't open.
<i> (Marnie)</i> What?

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:48.641
There are no windows,
either.

00:38:48.643 --> 00:38:50.710
Grandma,
you gotta do something.

00:38:50.712 --> 00:38:54.046
Oh, dear. Oh, I can't.

00:38:54.048 --> 00:38:57.583
The Gray Spell must be
draining our powers.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.103
Right again, Agatha.

00:39:00.105 --> 00:39:01.938
<i> (laughs) </i>

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.975
You see, at this point,
I could keep you people
in here with a toothpick.

00:39:05.977 --> 00:39:10.512
Grandma was right.
You've been spying on us
this whole time.

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.014
Oh, I didn't need to.

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:14.617
You see, I already knew
about Aggie's little spell book.

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:16.619
That's why I knew
you'd end up at Gort's.

00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:19.021
How could you?

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:21.791
I lost that book
before you were born.

00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:25.395
So, Marnie,
have you thought any more
about going to the party?

00:39:25.397 --> 00:39:27.563
I mean, everyone's
gonna be there,

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.932
even your mom.

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:33.435
My mom? You're lying.

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:35.604
My mom hates Halloween.

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:38.241
Oh, I think my dad
got her into the spirit.

00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:41.244
He's not really my dad,
actually. He's more of
a science experiment.

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:44.180
But he got her into
a really ugly mask.
It's a scream.

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:47.616
You know,
this is not the way
to talk me into a date.

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:51.003
This is more than a date.
This is our future together.

00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:54.074
I'm in control
of my own future,

00:39:54.076 --> 00:39:56.593
and it doesn't
include you.

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:01.714
Creature Spell.

00:40:01.716 --> 00:40:05.018
What?
That's a spell
in my book.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.719
It's a spell
that was banned

00:40:06.721 --> 00:40:09.472
after the dark times.

00:40:09.474 --> 00:40:12.642
It was used on humans
who mocked us

00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:16.045
by dressing up
like creatures.

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:18.098
It was used on them

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.034
to turn them into
the very creatures

00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:23.135
they were mocking.

00:40:23.137 --> 00:40:26.523
He turned the creatures
into humans,

00:40:26.525 --> 00:40:29.158
and now he's gonna
turn the humans
into creatures.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.362
That's why Cal
put your mother in a mask.

00:40:32.364 --> 00:40:35.365
I think he plans
to use the Creature Spell

00:40:35.367 --> 00:40:37.800
on the mortal world
at midnight.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:51.948
Dylan.

00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:55.517
Do you want me to read you
a bedtime story?

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.987
No. Listen.

00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:00.656
"Golems are
very pleasant creatures

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:03.392
"built entirely from mud
or other natural elements.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:07.346
They have no will of their own
and do whatever their creators
tell them."

00:41:07.348 --> 00:41:09.916
Good. Be a golem.
Go to bed.

00:41:09.918 --> 00:41:13.152
You said you saw a frog
on the floor just after
Cal's dad left.

00:41:13.154 --> 00:41:16.155
And then, later, he shows up
in a giant frog costume?

00:41:16.157 --> 00:41:19.308
What is this, some sort
of Biblical plague thing?

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.228
Sophie, Mom hasn't
gone out with anyone
in two years.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.916
I'm not going to that party
just to tell her that you think
her date is a reptile.

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:28.651
Frogs are amphibians.

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:30.136
I'm not going.

00:41:30.138 --> 00:41:32.137
Somebody's gotta be here
to water the plants

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:33.773
when they take you all away.

00:41:33.775 --> 00:41:36.843
Dylan, I can't do this
by myself.

00:41:36.845 --> 00:41:39.696
Whether you like it or not,
you're a Cromwell, too,

00:41:39.698 --> 00:41:42.131
and that means you feel things
just like we do.

00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:44.500
Tell me you don't feel
like something's wrong.

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:49.204
OK, maybe we'll go
for a minute,

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:51.707
but just to prove to you
that nothing is wrong.

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.392
You'll need a costume.

00:41:56.615 --> 00:42:00.249
<i> (man shouts) </i>

00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:03.669
No way.

00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:06.256
OK...

00:42:06.258 --> 00:42:08.824
he's keeping us in here
with a spell,

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:12.962
so maybe we can come up
with a stronger one.

00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:14.997
Oh, our powers
are draining, dear.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.867
I'm afraid we're trapped.

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:20.870
But, Grandma,
saying a spell backwards

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:22.805
can't be the only way
to undo it.

00:42:22.807 --> 00:42:25.875
Oh, rules are rules.

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:30.379
But rules... rules
have exceptions, right?

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.365
I mean...

00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:37.169
like... like how hackers
get into computer programs.

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:39.472
They just look
for the back door.

00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:42.007
Computers have back doors?

00:42:42.009 --> 00:42:46.145
Well, back doors are ways
of getting into a program
if there's a problem.

00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:51.367
I wonder if spells
have back doors.

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:54.770
So you mean a way
to weasel out of the spell

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.839
without actually
breaking it.

00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:59.342
Right. Like this spell.

00:42:59.344 --> 00:43:02.478
It's supposed to keep us
from getting outside, right?

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.580
Yeah. So?

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:09.685
So what if we tried
to go somewhere else
other than outside?

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.054
There is nowhere else.
There's only outside
and inside,

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:14.423
and right now, we're inside.

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:18.093
Time travel. Oh, Grandma, you
have a spell for that, right?

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.963
Grandma, do you have a spell
for time travel?

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:22.665
Time-travel spell.

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:23.866
Yeah.

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.068
Oh, I believe I do.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.337
A lovely little poem.

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:33.409
Gort... Gort... That sock
doesn't match the other one.

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:37.079
Grandma, Grandma,
none of them match. Focus.

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.964
Come on. Ooh, I know.
Here, here.

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:40.733
You write it down,
write, write.

00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:43.236
What is it? What -
Just a minute.

00:43:43.238 --> 00:43:45.304
Write it down
before you forget it.

00:43:45.306 --> 00:43:47.106
Spell, spell. Oh...

00:43:47.108 --> 00:43:49.008
Hurry, Grandma.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:54.046
There. It's a little fuzzy -
fuzzy there, but...

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:55.447
There, that's it.

00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:58.317
That's it, that's it.

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:00.019
Grandma!

00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:02.088
Can you read that?

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.090
I don't know, but here,
let's help her up.

00:44:04.092 --> 00:44:05.124
Oh...

00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:12.865
Gort, there are
no matching socks here.

00:44:12.867 --> 00:44:17.620
Yes, well, uh,
I have some more
in the cupboard.

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:20.757
Well, go get them.

00:44:20.759 --> 00:44:23.592
No. Grandma,
read this spell with me.

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.261
No, go away.
We're busy.

00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:26.662
She's gone.

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.831
But, Grandma,
it's me - Marnie.

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.366
Here we go.

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:32.101
Grandma...

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:34.737
Oh, finally we can
get something accomplished.

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:37.940
Matching, matching.
You want the long one?

00:44:37.942 --> 00:44:39.976
Look, we have to
get out of here.

00:44:39.978 --> 00:44:42.979
We can come back
for her later.

00:44:42.981 --> 00:44:44.013
OK.

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:50.736
<i> (reading spell) </i>

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.668
OK, I say we head back
to the mortal world.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.337
The spell, it's coming back.

00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:10.672
Grandma, what's happening?

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:13.726
It's the Gray Spell.
It's affecting me...

00:45:13.728 --> 00:45:16.579
This is only
five minutes ago.

00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:18.898
Must not have
said it right.

00:45:21.419 --> 00:45:23.352
<i> (reading spell) </i>

00:45:30.662 --> 00:45:32.061
Aah.
Whoa.

00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:33.729
<i> (grunts) </i>

00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:36.632
OK, I overshot
just a little bit.

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:38.935
<i> (reading spell) </i>

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.241
<i> (Marnie screams) </i>

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:58.754
Luke?

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:01.724
Grandma?

00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:05.962
Nice job of escaping my spell.
You have real potential, Marnie.

00:46:05.964 --> 00:46:10.532
Where's Luke and Grandma?
And what time is it?

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:15.437
They're - Well, I guess
you could say I took 'em
offline for the moment.

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.140
It's a simple limbo spell.
I could teach it to you later.

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:21.477
You better stop breaking in
on my spells, Cal.

00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:23.712
It's against
the Code of Merlin.

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:27.617
Nobody cares about
the Code of Merlin
anymore, Marnie.

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:30.786
You need an update. And besides,
what do you wanna hang around

00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:33.088
a bunch of moldy old creatures
for, anyway?

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.108
These creatures
are my friends.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.128
Your mom's about to become
a really moldy old creature.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.046
Leave my mother alone.

00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:43.566
Oh, yeah,
that reminds me - Bye.

00:46:50.324 --> 00:46:52.340
<i> (reading spell) </i>

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.796
Luke?

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:19.201
Luke? Luke,
where -

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:23.138
You know, I think
I liked this place better
when it was gray.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.574
Where is Gort?

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:28.277
It's almost 11:00
in the mortal world.

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:30.078
We've got to find him.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.013
<i> (door closes) </i>

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:35.001
Oh, yeah, I think
you found him.

00:47:35.003 --> 00:47:37.603
What are you doing
in my house?

00:47:37.605 --> 00:47:40.956
Um, it's OK.
Aggie sent us.

00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:50.416
Well, that doesn't
make you welcome here.

00:47:50.418 --> 00:47:51.934
I hate Aggie!

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:55.704
Don't feel bad.
He hates everyone.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:48:01.393
Um, well, Aggie has
the greatest respect for you.

00:48:04.399 --> 00:48:06.499
She does?

00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:09.468
Yeah. She said
that you were

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.604
the smelliest, foulest,

00:48:12.606 --> 00:48:16.876
meanest inhabitant
in all of Halloweentown.

00:48:16.878 --> 00:48:18.744
Marnie, ixnay.

00:48:18.746 --> 00:48:21.464
She said that?

00:48:21.466 --> 00:48:25.868
Ehh, she's just trying
to butter me up.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.754
No, no, no.
She meant it, really.

00:48:28.756 --> 00:48:30.589
That's very sweet of her,

00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:33.108
and I hate it
when people are sweet!

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:36.879
Now get out!
I have messing up to do.

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:39.682
No. No, but there's
something that we need.

00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:44.553
Oh. Well, in that case,
take a number.

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:48.140
I'm now serving nobody!

00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:49.408
Uh, but -

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.746
Little girl, you stink
like a Cromwell,

00:48:54.748 --> 00:48:58.583
and I want you
out of my cottage!

00:48:58.585 --> 00:49:02.922
OK, OK. Nice Gort.

00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:05.024
<i> (growls) </i>

00:49:07.561 --> 00:49:10.445
Well, um, it was nice
seeing your place

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:14.583
while it was still messy.

00:49:14.585 --> 00:49:17.153
Wait.

00:49:17.155 --> 00:49:21.190
What do you mean,
"still messy"?

00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:25.193
There's this thing
called the Gray Spell,
you see,

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.695
and in a few years,

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:30.449
Kalabar's son is gonna make
your whole house neat.

00:49:30.451 --> 00:49:32.951
What?!

00:49:35.856 --> 00:49:38.390
Aah!

00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:41.794
<i> (screaming) </i>

00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:44.629
Slow down.

00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:47.465
Watch out. Aah!

00:49:47.467 --> 00:49:50.102
Are you sure Mom
said this was OK?

00:49:50.104 --> 00:49:53.205
No. Grandma hasn't taught me
how to fly yet.

00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:55.841
What?
It's OK.

00:49:55.843 --> 00:49:57.910
<i> (laughs) </i>

00:49:57.912 --> 00:49:59.111

<i> (screaming and moaning) </i>

00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:16.412
<i> (Luke)</i> What does it
look like?

00:50:16.414 --> 00:50:18.346
<i> (Marnie)</i>
It's a big leather book.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.208
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.811
I can't let this happen.

00:50:31.813 --> 00:50:34.680
My beautiful dirt cleaned?

00:50:34.682 --> 00:50:39.685
My wonderful junk sold
in a yard sale? Oh...

00:50:39.687 --> 00:50:44.757
Don't you have some sort of,
I don't know, filing system?

00:50:44.759 --> 00:50:49.979
Of course I do. I keep
all my scabs under the porch.

00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:51.313
Ew!

00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:53.482
Ugh, I'm sorry I asked.

00:50:53.484 --> 00:50:54.950
Aah!

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:59.821
Hey, Spike.
My boy, my boy.

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:04.393
Come to papa.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:07.129
Yes.

00:51:09.033 --> 00:51:13.535
OK. Go play,
but you play nice.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:17.405
Ohh, I don't think
the spell book is here.

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.808
We've looked everywhere.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:25.247
Maybe we came too far back
in time, maybe before she
even lost the spell book.

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:27.750
Well, Grandma said
she hasn't seen it for decades.

00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:30.485
We couldn't have
come back that far.

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:34.440
Hey, is this book
you're looking for leather?

00:51:34.442 --> 00:51:35.540
Yes.

00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:39.028
With some kind of fancy writing
on the front?

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.962
<i> Biblio Magica.</i>
Yeah.

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.114
I remember it.

00:51:42.116 --> 00:51:43.666
That's really good.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:48.370
Kalabar bought it from me
about 50 years ago.

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:51.022
That's really bad.

00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:53.058
Kalabar must've
been working on

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.712
this world-domination
thing for decades.

00:51:56.714 --> 00:52:01.250
Well, then that means
Cal must've had Grandma's
other spell book all along

00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:04.536
with the Gray Spell in it.

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:07.373
And the only reason
he took it out of our house...

00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:09.841
Was to stop you
from undoing the spell.

00:52:09.843 --> 00:52:15.180
Ugh. I can't believe it.

00:52:15.182 --> 00:52:18.350
We came all this way
for nothing. Ohh...

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.574
<i> (â™ª dance) </i>

00:52:35.102 --> 00:52:36.602
Nice landing, Sophie.

00:52:36.604 --> 00:52:39.772
Like you could do better.

00:52:47.348 --> 00:52:48.848
I don't see Mom.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:53.285
Oh, Cindy, I found
a great costume for the dance.

00:52:53.287 --> 00:52:57.522
Yeah? Who are you
supposed to be - El Geeko?

00:53:07.734 --> 00:53:08.766
There she is.

00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:12.037
Mom. Hey, Mom.

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:14.473
Mommy.

00:53:14.475 --> 00:53:18.343
Sophie? Dylan? What are
you guys doing here?

00:53:18.345 --> 00:53:22.381
Um, well, we're just
rocking to the beat.

00:53:31.325 --> 00:53:32.790
We had to talk to you.

00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:36.661
Talk to me? About what?
How did you get here?

00:53:40.034 --> 00:53:43.835
Alex, would you excuse us
for just a minute?

00:53:43.837 --> 00:53:46.138
Sure.
I'll get some punch.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.474
Great. You flew here?

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:50.642
Not very well.

00:53:50.644 --> 00:53:52.844
Why would you
do something like that?

00:53:52.846 --> 00:53:54.746
Sophie wants to
talk to you about Alex.

00:53:54.748 --> 00:53:56.181
Alex?

00:53:56.183 --> 00:53:58.783
He's not really
Cal's dad, Mom.

00:53:58.785 --> 00:54:01.953
Oh, I see. He's not.
And who is?

00:54:01.955 --> 00:54:05.657
We kind of left that part
out before because we didn't
think you'd like it.

00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:08.760
It's Kalabar, Mom.

00:54:08.762 --> 00:54:10.295
Aggie told you that.

00:54:10.297 --> 00:54:12.730
Marnie, but Grandma
thinks so, too.

00:54:12.732 --> 00:54:16.068
Oh, I see,
and so Alex is what,

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:18.770
an actor that Cal hired?

00:54:18.772 --> 00:54:20.539
Sophie has a theory.

00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:22.441
I think he's a golem.

00:54:22.443 --> 00:54:24.342
A golem.

00:54:24.344 --> 00:54:25.710
Made of frogs.

00:54:31.285 --> 00:54:36.405
You know, you did undo
Cal's spell once.

00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:38.206
What do you mean?

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.976
With me - the Gray Spell.

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:43.078
No, it just wore off.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.580
It didn't wear off
of Benny or Gort.

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:48.266
It had to have been
something you did or said.

00:54:48.268 --> 00:54:50.802
Like what?

00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:55.473
Well, uh, all right,
you were searching
through Aggie's house...

00:54:55.475 --> 00:54:57.692
Right, and you were
picking your nose.

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.929
And you couldn't find
the second spell book.

00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.950
Right, so
I was trying to get Grandma
to think of something else,

00:55:04.952 --> 00:55:08.002
some other way
to break the spell.

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.605
No, but you didn't say spell.
You said something else.

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:11.773
So?

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:15.944
So maybe whatever you said
undid the spell.

00:55:15.946 --> 00:55:19.081
I would've had to
be talking backwards
to undo the spell.

00:55:19.083 --> 00:55:23.402
Maybe it was in there
backwards somehow.

00:55:23.404 --> 00:55:27.873
OK. Um, I think
I called it a trap.

00:55:27.875 --> 00:55:31.143
Uh, something to get us
out of this trap.

00:55:34.732 --> 00:55:37.232
All right, why don't you
just say it all again?

00:55:37.234 --> 00:55:39.568
OK, it was something like,

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:43.305
something to get us
out of this trap.

00:55:43.307 --> 00:55:46.341
A spell or a charm.

00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:48.776
This trap.

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:54.299
A spell or a...

00:55:55.836 --> 00:55:57.936
You didn't say "charm,"
I know that.

00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.539
Something backwards.

00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:03.958
Uh, trap, no.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.013
Spell or a... no.

00:56:08.015 --> 00:56:11.550
Wait, wait. Here, trapa.

00:56:11.552 --> 00:56:13.351
Trapa?

00:56:13.353 --> 00:56:15.370
Yeah, it's "apart"
backwards.

00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:16.838
So?

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.091
So, does every spell
have to be long?

00:56:19.093 --> 00:56:21.927
No. Some spells are short.

00:56:21.929 --> 00:56:24.163
Then say this like a spell.

00:56:24.165 --> 00:56:25.581
But it's one word.

00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:27.199
Will you just try it?

00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:29.034
Fine.

00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:36.408
Apart.

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:41.797
<i> (nasal voice)</i> Oh, my.

00:56:41.799 --> 00:56:44.316
Oh, my. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:47.552
This place
is very, very messy.

00:56:47.554 --> 00:56:51.322
All right,
now say it backwards.

00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:53.291
Uh, trapa?

00:57:00.534 --> 00:57:02.534
<i> (gruff voice)</i> That was awful.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.255
I wanted to... clean.

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.657
Try it again.

00:57:08.659 --> 00:57:10.325
OK.

00:57:10.327 --> 00:57:11.426
Apart.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.196
Oh, my.

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:17.165
<i> (both chuckle) </i>
Oh, my.

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:22.287
Does anyone have a, uh...
a dustpan perhaps?

00:57:22.289 --> 00:57:23.755
Trapa.

00:57:29.629 --> 00:57:32.330
Will you stop doing that?

00:57:32.332 --> 00:57:35.867
You were right. We figured out
how to break the Gray Spell,

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:37.769
and now we can get
our full powers back.

00:57:37.771 --> 00:57:40.172
How much time do we have left
before the portal closes?

00:57:40.174 --> 00:57:44.793
15 minutes. Oh, my gosh,
Mom doesn't know about
the Creature Spell.

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:46.795
What if she's still
wearing that mask?

00:57:46.797 --> 00:57:49.097
We have to
get back to the present
before we can warn her.

00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:50.965
Right. Uh...

00:57:52.403 --> 00:57:56.171
Where's the time-travel spell?

00:57:56.173 --> 00:57:57.972
What do you mean?
You had it.

00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:02.044
Right, well, I put it
over there on that table

00:58:02.046 --> 00:58:04.829
when I had to dig through
the garbage.

00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:09.901
Oh, you shouldn't
have done that.

00:58:12.873 --> 00:58:17.142
Uh, why not?
What happened to it?

00:58:17.144 --> 00:58:19.511
It's lost.

00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:22.347
Well, that's OK, right,

00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:26.251
because things that get lost
end up here.

00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:29.971
Everything that's lost
other places ends up here.

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:34.292
But things
that are lost here
go poof.

00:58:34.294 --> 00:58:36.478
Poof?

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.146
Poof.

00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:40.749
Gone... forever.

00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:42.217
Poof.

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:45.454
Please tell me that you
remember the spell.

00:58:45.456 --> 00:58:49.007
It was Welsh.
I could barely read it.

00:58:49.009 --> 00:58:53.444
So we're stuck here?
We can't be stuck here.

00:58:53.446 --> 00:58:56.014
OK, OK, all right.
Let me think.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.571

Excuse me.

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.561
And as for you, Dylan,

00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:28.563
I would've expected you
to be more -

00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:31.065
Hey, I brought you guys
some cookies.

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.734
Everything all right?

00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:34.669
Um, yeah, just peachy.

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:35.903
Where's Cal?

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:37.305
Sophie?

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:40.008
Oh, he's around here
somewhere.

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.043
Your daughter stood him up.

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:44.312
I'm afraid
he's a little bit hurt,
poor fella.

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.014
Why did you
pick that costume?

00:59:46.016 --> 00:59:49.651
OK, guys, I think it's time
that you were running.

00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:52.120
'Cause the funny thing is,

00:59:52.122 --> 00:59:55.490
I saw this seventh grader
dressed up as a big fly.

00:59:55.492 --> 00:59:57.425
A fly.

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.461
Dylan.

00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.762
A big black one with feelers
and fuzzy legs.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.401
Mmm.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.336
I can even show you
what he looked like.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.672
Sweetheart, not here.

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:12.407
<i> (buzzing) </i>

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:16.978
Sophie, you know you're
not allowed to do magic
around strangers.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.346
Mommy, look.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:22.267
Alex?

01:00:22.269 --> 01:00:24.335
Are you all right?

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.424
Oh, that's not normal.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:33.244
<i> (gulps) </i>

01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:36.114
Oh, that was very good.

01:00:36.116 --> 01:00:38.316
You're not human.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.821
Ha. Nobody's perfect.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.125
You... you... you...

01:00:47.127 --> 01:00:49.828

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:53.130
<i> (recites spell) </i>

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:02.040
Does anybody know
where we can find a swamp?

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.676
Ohh, he was so perfect.

01:01:04.678 --> 01:01:06.545
Except for the
being-made-of-frogs part.

01:01:06.547 --> 01:01:09.281
I'm really sorry, you guys.

01:01:09.283 --> 01:01:11.916
You came here to warn me,
but Marnie...

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:16.555
Marnie... where is she?
She was in Halloweentown
last time she called.

01:01:16.557 --> 01:01:18.907
She and Grandma
were having trouble
getting through the portal

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.860
because of Cal's spell.
It's almost midnight.
How did you talk to her?

01:01:21.862 --> 01:01:23.695
The head phone.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:30.768
Marnie? Marnie,
can you hear me?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.804
<i> The party you are</i>
<i> trying to reach</i>

01:01:32.806 --> 01:01:34.840
<i> is currently</i>
<i> out of this dimension.</i>

01:01:34.842 --> 01:01:37.442
<i> If you'd like</i>
<i> to leave a message,</i>

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:41.112
<i> your party will receive it</i>
<i> in approximately 400 years.</i>

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.715

01:01:43.717 --> 01:01:46.851
<i> Pooh bear thenatos</i>
<i> 23 skidoo.</i>

01:01:51.524 --> 01:01:54.342
Will you just stop
saying that one?

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:56.460
I can't remember the spell.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.595
You have to.

01:01:57.597 --> 01:01:59.030
This is stupid.

01:01:59.032 --> 01:02:03.785
Why don't we
just use my timeline?

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:04.903
Your what?

01:02:04.905 --> 01:02:06.771
My timeline.

01:02:06.773 --> 01:02:08.940
Some wizard must've lost it.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:11.009
Come on, I keep it
in the closet.

01:02:11.011 --> 01:02:12.744
Timeline?

01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:18.333
Wow, how does it work?

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:21.636
The timelines tell us
what year it is
in the mortal world.

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:25.756
The past is one direction,
future is the other.

01:02:29.763 --> 01:02:32.597
You know, that looks like
a Stephen Hawking description

01:02:32.599 --> 01:02:34.699
of a non-stellar black hole.

01:02:34.701 --> 01:02:36.234
And your point is?

01:02:36.236 --> 01:02:40.138
Theoretically, black holes
can accelerate time.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.540
And that would
help us how?

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:45.443
Just follow
the fastest-moving timeline.

01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:46.677
Now get out of here.

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:48.412
Gort, I'm a goblin.

01:02:48.414 --> 01:02:50.999
Theoretically,
I can't fly.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:54.302
Oh, yes, you can.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.274
What's that?

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:04.445
This... is
my new-and-improved broom.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.581
Grandma gave it to me.
Wow.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.620
Cool, huh?

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:20.495
Come on, get on.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.430
Could you lower it a little?

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.368
Well, come on,
just swing your leg over.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.936
I'm a little afraid of flying.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.938
Oh, do you wanna stay here?

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.041
No.

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:33.975
Thought so.

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:38.880
Whoa, whoa.
Just hold on a minute.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.549
Thanks, Gort.
We are out of here!

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.918
Goodbye
and good riddance.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.957
Look out, look out.

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.727
<i> (Sophie)</i> We've looked
everywhere, Mom.

01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:55.496
<i> (Dylan)</i> I didn't see
that Cal guy anywhere.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.332
Do you think
he's wearing a mask?

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:01.770
I don't know.
You guys go hang out over
by the refreshment table.

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:04.205
Now, if you see him,
don't do anything.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.874
Just come and get me.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:09.710
And whatever he's planning,
it is up to us to stop him.

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:12.313
I'm gonna wear my mask.
He knows me.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.034
"The Creature Spell."

01:04:50.036 --> 01:04:53.420
And so the fun begins.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.625
Any luck?
No.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:00.028
He's here somewhere.
I can feel it.

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:04.799
So can I. We've gotta
find him and get the portal
open before midnigh...

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:08.303
The witchin' hour.

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:11.673
Everyone, count down with me.
Here we go. 60...

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:12.857
Find him.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.713
We're never gonna make it.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.232
The portal closes
in just a few minutes,

01:05:21.234 --> 01:05:24.969
and we're only in the 1600s.

01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:26.771
Hey, I think we should

01:05:26.773 --> 01:05:29.340
try to go into that
black hole over there.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.442
57, 56...

01:05:31.444 --> 01:05:33.862

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:40.168

let's say, doesn't work?

<i> (girl)</i> I can't breathe!

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:38.963
What's going on?

01:08:38.965 --> 01:08:41.548
Where's my other eye?

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:46.487
Mom...

01:08:53.813 --> 01:08:56.698
Marnie, where are you?

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.732
<i> (screams) </i>

01:09:01.288 --> 01:09:04.088
This can't be happening.

01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:08.225
That's weird.
My teeth won't come out.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:11.663
I'm really thirsty.

01:09:11.665 --> 01:09:12.997
Cindy.

01:09:12.999 --> 01:09:15.900
Uh... uh...
Cindy, stop it.

01:09:18.137 --> 01:09:20.004
Help me.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:33.167
I can't believe it.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.269
The portal's closed.

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:39.006
We're gonna be stuck here
for a year of mortal-world time.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:45.647
I suppose it'll
give us time to train you,
as we planned to do.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.883
And then, when
the portal opens again,

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.768
we'll be ready
to fight Cal.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:56.156
Just wait for a year
of mortal time?

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.726
It's gonna feel like
a century here.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.027
Whatever.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.797
No, not whatever.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.568
It's all my fault.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:12.073
It's all my fault
Mom's been turned into
this horrible creature.

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:15.843
There's gotta be
something we can do.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:19.446
Marnie,
I love them, too,

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:22.600
but I can't
change the rules.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.371
Then maybe<i> we</i> can.

01:10:27.674 --> 01:10:31.108
What -
What are you doing?

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.677
Calling Sophie.

01:10:32.679 --> 01:10:36.080
Sophie. Soph, are you there?

01:10:36.082 --> 01:10:39.983
<i> (monsters yelling</i>
<i> and growling) </i>

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:42.136
Marnie, is that you?

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:47.307
Sophie, listen to me.
We're gonna open the portal.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.877
We can't.
It's after midnight.

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:53.464
I don't care.
That's not gonna stop me.

01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:56.467
The portal hasn't always
been there.

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:58.669
It was created by magic,

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.773
and nobody's magic
is stronger than ours, right?

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:03.724
I guess so.

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:06.427
No. You've got to believe it.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:10.731
And Dylan has to, too.

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.166
Come on.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.468
<i> What do you say?</i>

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:18.405
OK, but how do we do it?
There's no spell for this.

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:21.809
We'll just have to
make up our own.

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.160
Are you ready?

01:11:23.162 --> 01:11:25.829
What am I
supposed to do?

01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:28.899
Stop thinking
about it, Dylan.
Just feel it.

01:11:37.943 --> 01:11:40.994
Hey, I'm no warlock.

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:45.382
I need somebody who believes
that anything is possible.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:46.651
Do you believe that?

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:54.125
If you're there, yeah.

01:11:56.429 --> 01:11:58.229
Grandma.

01:11:59.499 --> 01:12:01.866
I'm not sure
how this'll work out,

01:12:01.868 --> 01:12:04.835
but I've always
believed in you.

01:12:11.444 --> 01:12:14.678
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.948
to heal the wound
that worlds divide.

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:22.020
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

01:12:22.022 --> 01:12:25.856
and each of us
our own path decide.

01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:29.560
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:12:29.562 --> 01:12:32.663
to heal the wound
that worlds divide.

01:12:32.665 --> 01:12:35.899
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:39.303
and each of us
our own path decide.

01:12:40.373 --> 01:12:42.974
What is that?

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.144
Something's happening.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.800
I can't believe it.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.902
She's trying
to open the portal.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:04.712
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.715
to heal the wound
that worlds divide.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:11.285
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:15.089
and each of us
our own path decide.

01:13:28.788 --> 01:13:29.787
Yes.

01:13:29.789 --> 01:13:31.088
Marnie!

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.227
We did it.
Oh, look, there's Sophie.

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:39.162
No, it's impossible.

01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:44.151
Yes. Good job.

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:45.519
That's him.

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.187
<i> (gasps) </i>

01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.750
I don't care how strong
you think you are,

01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:02.386
but you could never beat me.

01:14:02.388 --> 01:14:06.991
Your only power was the power
to keep us apart, Cal.

01:14:06.993 --> 01:14:09.794
And now you don't
have that power anymore.

01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:15.065
We don't have to
hate each other.

01:14:15.067 --> 01:14:19.870
Just give me back
Aggie's spell books.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:25.176
Dad was right. You're the enemy,
and you always will be.

01:14:25.178 --> 01:14:28.112
You told me you make
your own decisions.

01:14:28.114 --> 01:14:30.981
Don't let your father's hate
decide for you now.

01:14:30.983 --> 01:14:31.916
Go ahead.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:39.356
Take the books.
I'd like to watch.

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:46.213
Is good stronger than evil?
Let's find out.

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.819
I'm not afraid of you.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:56.957
I may feel sorry for you
and I'd like to help you,

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.827
but I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:08.855 --> 01:15:10.087
Marnie, be careful.

01:15:44.107 --> 01:15:51.178
Aah!

01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:01.655
He'll be back.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:05.025
And we'll be waiting...
together.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.797
Grandma, will you
do the honors?

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:11.431
Of course, dear.

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:15.469
Oh, Luke.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.409
<i> (reading spell backwards) </i>

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:43.848
Wow, I just had
the weirdest dream.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.882
Was I asleep?

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:52.873
Well, I don't know
who put this all together,

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:55.042
but let's have a big hand

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:57.845
for the best Halloween party
ever, huh?!

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.414
Huh? Yeah.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.534
Whoo.

01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:08.138
Yeah.

01:17:12.145 --> 01:17:13.677
Mom.

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:15.512
You're OK.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.318
Mother.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.122
I don't know if I'll ever
stop you guys from fighting,

01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:29.059
but at least you won't
have to fight over me anymore.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.562
I know you both
have things to teach me,

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.465
and now I don't
have to choose.

01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:37.434
Well, I'm not sure what
I'm going to teach you.

01:17:37.436 --> 01:17:40.971
It seems Marnie already
knows more than I do.

01:17:40.973 --> 01:17:43.807
Oh, Grandma, we better
go back to Halloweentown
and get rid of the Gray Spell.

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:45.175
Quite right. You coming?

01:17:45.177 --> 01:17:50.714
Oh, I don't think so, Mom.
This is my world.

01:17:50.716 --> 01:17:54.117
But I guess the kids
can come and visit you
any time they want

01:17:54.119 --> 01:17:56.720
now that they've figured out
their way around the rules.

01:17:56.722 --> 01:17:59.490
Then you can
expect me for dinner
next Halloween.

01:17:59.492 --> 01:18:01.324
You be good, sweetheart.

01:18:01.326 --> 01:18:02.459
Oh, you, too, Mom.

01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:04.728
Bye.
Bye.

01:18:05.798 --> 01:18:07.798
All right, come on.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.501
Let's get you out of here
before somebody gives you
the prize for best mask.

01:18:10.503 --> 01:18:12.736
Ya think?
Yeah. You, too.

01:18:19.762 --> 01:18:20.694
Trapa.

01:18:23.516 --> 01:18:25.749
Trapa.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.421

Trapa. Trapa.

Trapa.

01:18:36.562 --> 01:18:37.561
Just try it.

01:18:37.563 --> 01:18:38.595
He's busy.

01:18:38.597 --> 01:18:42.265
I've got your receipt...
right here.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:46.103
Trapa.

01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:50.724
Wow, talk about going on
a crash diet. Ha-ha.

What's everybody
so happy about?

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:15.315
Hey, she did it.
She changed it back.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:17.685
Yeah, check it out.

01:19:17.687 --> 01:19:20.754
So this World Wide Web
I've heard about -
Mm-hmm.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:24.158
Does it involve spiders?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.259
Grandma...
I think it's time

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:28.328
maybe we started
your training.

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:31.598
Ooh, I'd like that.
Yeah.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.533
I'd like that.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:51.852
<i> â™ª Under a cloak of black</i>

<i> â™ª Eye of newt</i>
<i> and wing of bat</i>
