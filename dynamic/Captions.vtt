WEBVTT

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.470
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.406
Seen it. Seen it.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:05.705
Huh. What's this about?

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.575
<i>At the dawn...
dawn... dawn...</i>

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:08.939
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.954
Ah. Here we go.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.593
<i>At the dawn of time,</i>

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:29.168
<i>there was our gracious
and powerful creator,</i>

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.863
<i>Primus.</i>

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:36.065
<i>To protect our universe,
he sacrificed his life force,</i>

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.871
<i>transforming himself
into our planet,</i>

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.643
<i>Cybertron.</i>

00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:45.415
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.979
<i>Primus birthed
the first Transformers</i>

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.290
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.358
<i>the most powerful
Transformers,</i>

00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:58.230
<i>appointed to lead and protect
future generations.</i>

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.960
<i>To assist them, Primus created
an entity of great power,</i>

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.160
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.163
The Matrix, there it is. Okay.
Good. Come on. Keep going.

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.836
<i>With the Matrix
in the Primes' possession,</i>

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:17.348
<i>Cybertron's natural
power source, Energon,
flowed in abundance,</i>

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:20.714
<i>sustaining life
across the planet.</i>

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:27.358
<i>Attention!
Unauthorized movement
detected in archival vault.</i>

00:03:27.358 --> 00:03:28.656
<i>Sector J-3.</i>

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:30.724
KDQ-12 to KDK-1.

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:32.561
Breaching archives
in ten seconds.

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:37.401
<i>For generations,
there was peace and prosperity,</i>

00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:40.833
<i>until the Matrix
of Leadership was lost,</i>

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:44.540
<i>causing Energon
to no longer flow.</i>

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.709
Why does every legend
about the Matrix
end right there?

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.975
One of these
has to say what happened.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:53.241
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to be detained!</i>

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:55.386
Oh, hey there.
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to--</i>

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:57.949
Uh-oh.

00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:02.085
Freeze!
Get down!

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:04.659
Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.056
Which way is the exit?

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:07.596
I must've taken a wrong turn.

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:10.434
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.897
Orion Pax.
Who cares?

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:13.932
We told you
to never come back here!

00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:16.902
Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:19.575
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:23.205
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:25.240
Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.078
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:30.949
Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:31.917
Oh, yeah?

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:33.919
Well, watch this.

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.089
Get him!

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:43.599
I-- I-- Uh...

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.293
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:46.932
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.703
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to be detained!</i>

00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:50.133
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:04.653
Come on! Start! Come on!

00:05:04.653 --> 00:05:07.326
Whoa!

00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:14.696
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:18.469
There he is!

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:25.168
Ha-ha! So long, suck--

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:28.336
Ooh, Energon.

00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:30.140
Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:38.951
Hey!

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.529
Whoa!

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.367
Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:03.041
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:04.482
You want to give me
another one?

00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:06.880
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.717
Hey!
Watch where you're going!

00:06:08.717 --> 00:06:10.554
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

00:06:10.554 --> 00:06:12.116
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:13.986
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

00:06:13.986 --> 00:06:15.493
What? Where'd he go?

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:16.956
The filthy
red and blue bot?

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:18.925
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.630
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.324
Where is he?
He went that way.

00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:24.502
When I get
my hands on that bot...

00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:35.238
All right, all clear.

00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:37.878
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:39.550
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.684
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:43.752
Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.556
Almost died.
It was wild.

00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:47.789
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.153
Yes, it is.

00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:50.627
I need a new best friend.

00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:52.530
If there are clues
in our recorded history

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.631
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:56.028
they're in the archives.

00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:59.394
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:01.506
is up on the surface
right now,

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:04.740
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.842
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

00:07:07.842 --> 00:07:09.404
Yeah, okay.

00:07:09.404 --> 00:07:11.175
The sooner Energon
flows again,

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:13.342
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:15.685
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.347
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

00:07:18.347 --> 00:07:22.857
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

00:07:22.857 --> 00:07:24.892
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:26.663
you could transform
without a cog?

00:07:26.663 --> 00:07:28.456
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:30.898
Took me three days
to pry you open.

00:07:30.898 --> 00:07:32.031
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:33.571
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:33.571 --> 00:07:35.804
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

00:07:37.577 --> 00:07:39.467
Hey, if we did have cogs--

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:41.744
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:43.680
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.584
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:48.850
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.820
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.690
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.990
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.596
What?

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:00.455
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:02.061
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.459
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.101
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:11.004
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

00:08:11.004 --> 00:08:12.500
I know, buddy.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.680
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

00:08:18.376 --> 00:08:20.552
Thanks.
Always got your back.

00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:22.950
No matter what.

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.121
<i>Approaching sublevel station.
Stand clear of doors.</i>

00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.057
<i>Mining teams,
prepare to unload.</i>

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.541
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:56.016
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:57.347
So much, Elita-1!

00:08:57.347 --> 00:08:59.349
And how perfect
is my mining record?

00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:00.856
So perfect, Elita-1!

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:03.221
We are a mere
30 units of Energon away

00:09:03.221 --> 00:09:05.256
from my promotion to supervisor.

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:06.829
Are you happy for me?

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:08.226
So happy, Elita-1!

00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:10.998
Elita-- I mean Captain,

00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:13.704
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:15.706
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:17.499
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

00:09:17.499 --> 00:09:18.973
Apology accepted.

00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:20.711
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.339
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:23.978
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:25.881
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:27.542
You don't have
the touch or the power.

00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:29.753
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:31.689
She's in a good mood today.
Mm-hmm.

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:33.416
You ready?
Always ready.

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.055
Let's punch in.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:36.760
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.091
Brace it up!

00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:41.028
Here we go! Bridge!

00:09:41.028 --> 00:09:42.260
Brace up!

00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:45.604
Lower channel is open.

00:09:50.466 --> 00:09:52.369
Drill power on max!

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:53.469
Low bridge!

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:00.245
Drill it out!

00:10:02.447 --> 00:10:03.611
I tapped a vein!

00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:10.453
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.495
Evacuate!

00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:23.103
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:24.775
The tunnel is closing.

00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:27.778
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:30.946
You with me, D?
On your six! Keep going!

00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:32.915
Look out!

00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:38.283
Jazz is stuck!

00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:39.449
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:41.319
I'm falling back to assist.

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:43.090
<i>Negative.
Do not break protocol.
Evacuate!</i>

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.224
We're gonna need more lift.

00:10:45.224 --> 00:10:47.589
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:48.832
Yeah. Good idea.

00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:51.164
What? No, I didn't mean it!

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:55.806
Pull him clear!

00:11:00.043 --> 00:11:01.603
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

00:11:01.603 --> 00:11:04.309
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

00:11:04.309 --> 00:11:05.915
It's all good.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.248
Oh, that's not good.

00:11:09.248 --> 00:11:11.822
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

00:11:11.822 --> 00:11:13.923
<i>Elita, it's about
to get messy out there!</i>

00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:21.062
Go, go, go!

00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:25.869
Run! Run!

00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:27.695
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:29.807
Come on! Go, go, go!

00:11:36.574 --> 00:11:38.673
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:41.247
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

00:11:41.247 --> 00:11:43.216
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:45.647
Elita-1, you're fired.

00:11:45.647 --> 00:11:48.716
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:50.652
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

00:11:50.652 --> 00:11:52.324
No one asked you!

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:54.623
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:57.692
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

00:11:57.692 --> 00:12:00.365
Report to waste management
immediately.

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:02.037
Waste management?

00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:04.039
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:05.568
before you ruin someone's life?

00:12:05.568 --> 00:12:06.734
I'm sorry!

00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:10.111
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:13.345
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:16.282
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:19.923
Excuse me, sir.

00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:21.826
Allow me.

00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:24.257
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

00:12:24.257 --> 00:12:26.798
Why?

00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:42.671
That really hurt.

00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.211
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:45.883
You know you were
out of line,

00:12:45.883 --> 00:12:48.116
talking back
to a superior like that.

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:50.283
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:54.584
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:59.028
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.758
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

00:13:05.102 --> 00:13:06.871
I'm glad
you were there with me

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:08.466
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:10.699
Anytime, buddy.

00:13:10.699 --> 00:13:12.602
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

00:13:12.602 --> 00:13:15.737
<i>Stand by for
a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:18.641
He's back?
He's back already?
Maybe he found the Matrix.

00:13:22.713 --> 00:13:25.219
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:27.056
<i>Hello, my friends.</i>

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.618
<i>Hello, Iacon City!</i>

00:13:28.618 --> 00:13:31.258
<i>Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners</i>

00:13:31.258 --> 00:13:34.261
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain
our Energon reserves.</i>

00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:37.198
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

00:13:37.198 --> 00:13:40.564
Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

00:13:40.564 --> 00:13:42.533
Ah! Nobody does it better!

00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:45.305
<i>Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet</i>

00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:46.977
<i>after another
treacherous expedition</i>

00:13:46.977 --> 00:13:50.343
<i>across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet.</i>

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:52.884
<i>I departed with hopes
of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:55.084
<i>the key to bringing balance
to Cybertron.</i>

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.119
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

00:13:57.119 --> 00:13:58.516
<i>that we've
returned empty-handed.</i>

00:13:59.781 --> 00:14:03.158
<i>This is a setback,
but not a failure.</i>

00:14:03.158 --> 00:14:06.194
<i>Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

00:14:06.194 --> 00:14:08.658
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

00:14:08.658 --> 00:14:10.462
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:13.762
<i>Right now,
I think we all
deserve a little fun!</i>

00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:16.303
<i>Tomorrow,
there will be no work.
All shifts off</i>

00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:20.010
<i>because tomorrow
is the Iacon 5000!</i>

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.343
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

00:14:23.343 --> 00:14:24.839
<i>My favorite event.</i>

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:27.875
<i>A high-octane race
all across Iacon City.</i>

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:32.154
<i>Let's all see which competitor
can prove they are truly
more than meets the eye.</i>

00:14:40.758 --> 00:14:41.790
D.

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:44.562
Psst! Hey, D.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.441
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

00:14:55.441 --> 00:14:58.378
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

00:14:58.378 --> 00:15:00.083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:02.184
All right, what if...
what if...

00:15:02.184 --> 00:15:04.681
what if tomorrow

00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:08.520
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:11.490
What if kill you
for waking me up?

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.228
No, no, no, hear me out.

00:15:13.228 --> 00:15:14.691
We don't even have to win!

00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:16.066
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:19.267
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:21.269
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:23.403
Not only would we
go down in history,

00:15:23.403 --> 00:15:26.736
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

00:15:26.736 --> 00:15:28.606
but we would show everyone
that we're--

00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:30.674
we're capable
of so much more!

00:15:30.674 --> 00:15:32.016
Or we get
publicly humiliated

00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:33.743
and then busted
back to tier one.

00:15:33.743 --> 00:15:36.680
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.319
Pax...
Come on, D.

00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:39.782
Pax.

00:15:39.782 --> 00:15:42.653
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

00:15:42.653 --> 00:15:45.887
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

00:15:45.887 --> 00:15:47.229
we can't race.

00:15:47.229 --> 00:15:48.296
Come on, let's go.

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:51.299
All right, fine.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:53.037
Yeah, maybe you're right.

00:15:57.802 --> 00:15:59.109
Maybe.

00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:03.674
The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

00:16:03.674 --> 00:16:05.247
I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:07.447
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:09.119
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:11.220
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.354
I wanted good seats.

00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:16.225
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.996
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:20.064
Hold up!

00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:26.763
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

00:16:26.763 --> 00:16:28.369
Okay,
where are you taking me?

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.769
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:34.111
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

00:16:34.111 --> 00:16:35.805
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:37.378
like, we're joking around,

00:16:37.378 --> 00:16:39.974
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:43.549
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

00:16:46.257 --> 00:16:50.325
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000.
There they are.</i>

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:55.627
<i>Put your hands together
as today's competitors
are taking the field.</i>

00:16:55.627 --> 00:16:58.597
Look! There's
Thunderglide and Behemoth!

00:16:58.597 --> 00:17:02.271
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.034
You did this for me?

00:17:07.034 --> 00:17:08.145
No.

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:10.147
I did this for us.

00:17:14.615 --> 00:17:17.682
<i>And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:19.420
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i>

00:17:20.357 --> 00:17:22.555
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:26.163
<i>Quintessons fear him,
but we love him!</i>

00:17:26.163 --> 00:17:29.331
<i>Our leader,
the one and only...</i>

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.135
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

00:17:31.135 --> 00:17:32.433
I love you, Sentinel!

00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:39.143
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

00:17:42.577 --> 00:17:45.677
My friends.
My Cybertronian family.

00:17:46.843 --> 00:17:49.043
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:51.584
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

00:17:51.584 --> 00:17:55.126
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:57.755
and our Energon supply
dried up.

00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:01.825
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:03.794
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

00:18:03.794 --> 00:18:08.029
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:11.736
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:18.578
Racers, on your marks!

00:18:23.387 --> 00:18:26.223
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

00:18:26.223 --> 00:18:28.753
The best seats
in the house!

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:29.853
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

00:18:29.853 --> 00:18:31.591
<i>Get set!</i>

00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.396
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:35.793
Oh, no.

00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:38.862
<i>And they're off!</i>

00:18:45.308 --> 00:18:47.904
Are you crazy?
Sure feels like it.

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:52.909
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i>

00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:57.782
I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:00.224
Miners!
Those are miners,
like us!

00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:03.117
<i>I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!
Miners trying to run</i>

00:19:03.117 --> 00:19:04.822
<i>in the Iacon 5000!</i>
You've got to be kidding me.

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.923
<i>This is insane!</i>

00:19:06.923 --> 00:19:09.563
There are miners
in the race!
Miners?

00:19:09.563 --> 00:19:10.795
No way!
They can't even transform!

00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:12.632
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:19.034
<i>This is a first
in Iacon 5000 history.</i>

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:21.135
<i>How are they going to survive?</i>

00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.008
If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!

00:19:26.008 --> 00:19:27.482
I accept those terms.

00:19:32.885 --> 00:19:35.853
<i>It's Tailwind
pulling into the lead
down the main stretch</i>

00:19:35.853 --> 00:19:38.625
<i>followed by Strafe and Skyfire!</i>

00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:41.628
Hey, look out!

00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:46.732
I owe you one.
More like a thousand.

00:19:49.198 --> 00:19:50.934
I can't believe
we're not in last place!

00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:56.005
Eat it, miner!

00:19:56.005 --> 00:19:59.008
<i>Darkwing delivers
a devastating blow!</i>
Gotcha!

00:20:05.918 --> 00:20:08.182
We're not fast enough!
Improvise!

00:20:13.596 --> 00:20:16.300
Hey! Get off!
Spinout! Big fan!

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.566
Hey!
Jetstorm, I'm so sorry.
Big fan!

00:20:19.536 --> 00:20:21.195
Get off!

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:34.241
Time it just right!

00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:36.111
And... now!

00:20:37.587 --> 00:20:38.916
Move!

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:45.186
<i>And the miners
have fallen way behind.</i>

00:20:45.186 --> 00:20:48.057
<i>We can now focus
on the real contenders
in this race.</i>

00:21:05.714 --> 00:21:09.353
<i>I don't believe it!
The miners take down Darkwing!</i>

00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:12.048
Oh, miners!

00:21:12.048 --> 00:21:13.786
Great effort,
Darkwing!

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:15.623
That worked!
It actually worked!

00:21:15.623 --> 00:21:17.790
Is this the dumbest thing
we've ever done?

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.330
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.261
No, no, no!

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.802
Whoa!

00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:34.642
Wait!

00:21:34.642 --> 00:21:35.874
Go, go, go!

00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:40.142
<i>A four-bot pileup
in the magnetic tunnel</i>

00:21:40.142 --> 00:21:43.453
<i>and the two miners are now
in first position!</i>

00:21:43.453 --> 00:21:46.423
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:51.824
Ah!

00:21:51.824 --> 00:21:53.188
D!

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.190
No. Go. Leave me!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.500
No, we do this together.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.601
<i>One miner is now
carrying the other</i>

00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:01.966
<i>mere steps
from the finish line</i>

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:05.739
<i>in the most amazing,
sensational, dramatic,
heartrending, exciting,</i>

00:22:05.739 --> 00:22:07.708
<i>thrilling finish
in the history of--</i>

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:13.483
<i>We have a winner!</i>

00:22:13.483 --> 00:22:16.618
<i>Chromia comes from behind
to take the prize.</i>

00:22:16.618 --> 00:22:18.983
<i>Talk about an Iacon 5000
for the ages.</i>

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:22.756
Well, second place
is still pretty good.

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:29.763
<i>Paging Dr. Ratchet.
Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.</i>

00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:31.864
Do not worry.
You will be fixed up
in no time.

00:22:31.864 --> 00:22:34.163
Did I win?

00:22:34.163 --> 00:22:35.802
You participated.

00:22:35.802 --> 00:22:37.100
Yay!

00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:40.708
So...

00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:42.875
how long do you think
we'll be here?

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.140
I'm not talking to you.

00:22:49.312 --> 00:22:51.345
You know what?
I can't believe
you made me do that.

00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:53.820
We are so screwed!
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.955
Hey, look, I know
it's all a big joke to you.
But not me.

00:22:56.955 --> 00:22:59.188
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

00:22:59.188 --> 00:23:00.563
And now they're gonna
bust me down

00:23:00.563 --> 00:23:02.026
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:03.830
I'm sorry, D.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.568
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

00:23:05.568 --> 00:23:07.669
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:09.297
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

00:23:09.297 --> 00:23:12.168
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

00:23:12.168 --> 00:23:14.874
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

00:23:16.108 --> 00:23:17.547
But it doesn't matter.

00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:19.912
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

00:23:19.912 --> 00:23:23.014
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

00:23:23.014 --> 00:23:25.280
This is so embarrassing.

00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:39.965
It's clear.

00:23:44.037 --> 00:23:45.399
Orion Pax.

00:23:46.171 --> 00:23:47.874
D-16.

00:23:47.874 --> 00:23:49.513
What you two did today

00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:52.109
was one of the
craziest things
I've ever seen.

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:54.617
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

00:23:54.617 --> 00:23:56.047
I loved it!

00:23:56.047 --> 00:23:57.114
You did?

00:23:57.114 --> 00:23:58.984
How could anyone
not love it?

00:23:58.984 --> 00:24:01.756
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:04.154
So we're not
getting demoted?

00:24:04.154 --> 00:24:05.353
Demoted?

00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:11.458
Demoted.

00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:14.461
What is happening?

00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:19.268
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway
into the first shift

00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:24.647
since the race ended
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

00:24:24.647 --> 00:24:26.781
You inspired them
to work harder!

00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:28.882
Sentinel Prime, sir,

00:24:28.882 --> 00:24:33.150
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.086
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

00:24:35.086 --> 00:24:38.419
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:40.157
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

00:24:40.157 --> 00:24:42.456
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

00:24:42.456 --> 00:24:44.601
Wow! Okay, great.

00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:46.394
That sounds incredible.

00:24:46.394 --> 00:24:48.297
I would love to--
Sir, it's time.

00:24:48.297 --> 00:24:49.936
Ah, yes.

00:24:49.936 --> 00:24:51.608
I'm sorry, friends.

00:24:51.608 --> 00:24:53.676
We're preparing
our next travel
to the surface.

00:24:53.676 --> 00:24:56.470
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.616
Hang tight.
Airachnid, have someone
escort these heroes

00:24:59.616 --> 00:25:01.475
to my personal
service facilities.

00:25:02.346 --> 00:25:04.478
Best care in Iacon.

00:25:04.478 --> 00:25:06.315
Until next time, legends.

00:25:10.123 --> 00:25:14.092
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

00:25:14.092 --> 00:25:16.193
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

00:25:16.193 --> 00:25:18.833
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:19.999
and we're gonna go--

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:22.837
Miners!

00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:25.906
Hi, Darkwing.

00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:29.470
Oh, no, no, no.
No!

00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:33.045
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

00:25:33.045 --> 00:25:35.542
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

00:25:35.542 --> 00:25:38.853
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

00:25:38.853 --> 00:25:40.349
I'll make sure of that.

00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:42.659
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:44.793
I hate that guy!

00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:00.336
You! How did you get down here?

00:26:00.336 --> 00:26:02.074
There's no access to this level.

00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:04.109
There is nobody
down here but me.

00:26:04.109 --> 00:26:06.650
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.884
You're others!
You're not... me!

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:12.623
You're here,
and you're not me!

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:16.858
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

00:26:16.858 --> 00:26:19.355
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:21.555
I just haven't had
a lot of company

00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:23.667
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:26.934
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

00:26:26.934 --> 00:26:28.595
That's what I thought!

00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:31.565
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

00:26:31.565 --> 00:26:33.336
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:34.744
How long have you
been down here?

00:26:34.744 --> 00:26:36.405
How long have I been here?

00:26:36.405 --> 00:26:39.606
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:43.346
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:45.216
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

00:26:45.216 --> 00:26:48.252
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:49.726
But you can call me B.

00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:51.387
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

00:26:51.387 --> 00:26:54.093
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

00:26:54.093 --> 00:26:57.866
Which is actually pronounced...
"Badassatron."

00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.230
But if you have any critiques--

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.233
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

00:27:02.233 --> 00:27:04.169
Great question. You don't.

00:27:04.169 --> 00:27:05.775
We don't?
Nope.

00:27:05.775 --> 00:27:08.074
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:12.144
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

00:27:12.144 --> 00:27:15.180
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.753
Which is?
Oh!

00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:19.690
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.483
onto the conveyor belt.

00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:24.420
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.126
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:29.161
So you watch garbage burn.

00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:30.657
Yes!

00:27:30.657 --> 00:27:32.296
It is so great
that you're here now.

00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:34.199
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

00:27:34.199 --> 00:27:36.036
And then tell you
everything about me!

00:27:36.036 --> 00:27:38.940
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.271
with one or two
new best friends.

00:27:40.271 --> 00:27:42.471
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:44.143
Where are my manners?

00:27:44.143 --> 00:27:45.947
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

00:27:45.947 --> 00:27:47.949
Hey, guys, we've got company!

00:27:49.183 --> 00:27:51.755
This is EP-508,

00:27:51.755 --> 00:27:55.517
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

00:27:55.517 --> 00:27:57.926
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.895
Do they talk back to you?

00:27:59.895 --> 00:28:02.194
Um, they're not real.

00:28:02.194 --> 00:28:04.834
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:06.297
It's just
you've been down here a--

00:28:06.297 --> 00:28:07.870
No, I was talking to Steve.

00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:10.499
Classic Steve.

00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:12.303
What is that?
Look at this guy.

00:28:12.303 --> 00:28:15.339
It's coming from inside.

00:28:15.979 --> 00:28:17.847
Oh! Steve! No!

00:28:17.847 --> 00:28:21.048
I am so sorry.
Steve, no!

00:28:21.048 --> 00:28:23.149
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:28.055
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:31.190
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support.
Immediate support!</i>

00:28:31.863 --> 00:28:33.456
That's Alpha Trion.

00:28:33.456 --> 00:28:34.996
One of the Primes?

00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:37.328
<i>Repeat,
Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

00:28:37.328 --> 00:28:40.166
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:43.433
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

00:28:46.944 --> 00:28:49.340
Holy Primus!

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.640
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.249
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

00:28:57.249 --> 00:29:00.681
Which means
this is where we could find

00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:03.024
the Matrix of Leadership.

00:29:03.024 --> 00:29:06.555
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

00:29:06.555 --> 00:29:08.194
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

00:29:08.194 --> 00:29:10.966
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:13.760
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.201
You already tried
to "show everyone"

00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:16.730
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.105
which got us
stuck down here

00:29:18.105 --> 00:29:20.536
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.473
really cool guy.

00:29:23.473 --> 00:29:25.706
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

00:29:25.706 --> 00:29:27.510
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.248
It's dangerous!

00:29:29.248 --> 00:29:31.613
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

00:29:31.613 --> 00:29:33.483
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

00:29:33.483 --> 00:29:36.552
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

00:29:36.552 --> 00:29:37.960
Forever? This is great!

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.193
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

00:29:40.193 --> 00:29:42.129
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:44.263
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

00:29:44.263 --> 00:29:45.792
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

00:29:45.792 --> 00:29:47.530
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.939
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

00:29:49.939 --> 00:29:54.042
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.012
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

00:29:57.012 --> 00:29:59.916
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:02.182
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

00:30:02.182 --> 00:30:04.712
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

00:30:04.712 --> 00:30:06.890
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.024
Easy. I know a way.

00:30:10.192 --> 00:30:11.785
But it won't be easy.

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:14.755
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:17.131
Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

00:30:17.131 --> 00:30:19.628
Only 49 sublevels to go!

00:30:20.697 --> 00:30:22.796
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

00:30:22.796 --> 00:30:24.974
that go all the way
to the surface.

00:30:24.974 --> 00:30:27.438
Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

00:30:27.438 --> 00:30:29.836
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:32.311
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

00:30:39.782 --> 00:30:41.419
That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.163
Hold up! One more.

00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:54.531
I'll lock it down.

00:31:02.607 --> 00:31:05.839
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

00:31:05.839 --> 00:31:08.985
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

00:31:08.985 --> 00:31:11.020
Got her!

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.219
No, wait, I--

00:31:12.219 --> 00:31:13.550
Elita! Stop!

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.354
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

00:31:15.354 --> 00:31:16.586
Security! Sound the ala--

00:31:22.889 --> 00:31:24.902
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

00:31:27.038 --> 00:31:29.236
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

00:31:29.236 --> 00:31:31.403
So am I. To ruin your life.

00:31:41.943 --> 00:31:45.021
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:47.881
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

00:31:47.881 --> 00:31:50.422
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:51.621
Well, she's gone.

00:32:06.473 --> 00:32:07.901
Whoa!

00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:10.838
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

00:32:10.838 --> 00:32:11.982
Climb faster!

00:32:26.955 --> 00:32:28.295
Gotcha!

00:33:01.561 --> 00:33:03.660
Ah, the surface.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.201
It's beautiful.

00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:12.141
I am speechless.

00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:15.639
Elita, listen to me.

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:17.905
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

00:33:17.905 --> 00:33:19.940
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.350
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.847
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:27.618
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:30.093
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

00:33:30.093 --> 00:33:31.490
What?
Look.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.690
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.593
and then we found this message.

00:33:35.593 --> 00:33:37.826
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

00:33:37.826 --> 00:33:40.829
or scout
the locations ourselves.

00:33:40.829 --> 00:33:42.138
Whichever comes first.

00:33:43.999 --> 00:33:45.702
This was too important to wait.

00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:48.408
It will change all of our lives.

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:51.213
No, no, no, no.

00:33:51.213 --> 00:33:54.513
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

00:33:54.513 --> 00:33:56.383
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the--

00:33:56.383 --> 00:33:58.319
Hey, guys? Guys?

00:33:58.319 --> 00:33:59.386
What is that?

00:34:03.326 --> 00:34:05.018
Is it getting bigger?

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:07.856
Or closer?

00:34:15.899 --> 00:34:17.932
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:34:20.838 --> 00:34:22.541
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:23.542
It's closed!

00:34:23.542 --> 00:34:24.741
Oh, come on!

00:34:30.947 --> 00:34:33.783
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.544
<i>Elita?</i>

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.877
Elita?

00:35:01.877 --> 00:35:03.351
You okay?

00:35:05.817 --> 00:35:07.619
Please stop
punching me in the face.

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:08.818
Can you help?

00:35:08.818 --> 00:35:10.655
Iacon-- The train--

00:35:10.655 --> 00:35:13.889
Where's the train?
Relax, okay? Here it comes.

00:35:13.889 --> 00:35:15.924
And there it goes.

00:35:15.924 --> 00:35:19.059
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

00:35:26.706 --> 00:35:31.247
Okay, so I think
this is us,

00:35:31.247 --> 00:35:33.777
and if we follow
the path to--
Now you listen to me,

00:35:33.777 --> 00:35:36.351
Mr. "Zero Seconds
Since My Last Accident"!

00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:39.453
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

00:35:39.453 --> 00:35:43.325
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

00:35:43.325 --> 00:35:45.921
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:47.329
back to Iacon City

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:49.991
and to the first
supervisor depot we see,

00:35:49.991 --> 00:35:52.961
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

00:35:52.961 --> 00:35:54.765
using words that reflect me

00:35:54.765 --> 00:35:57.031
in a very positive light!
Got it?

00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:59.308
Yeah, okay.
Deal. Great. All right.

00:35:59.308 --> 00:36:01.640
Let's go!
She's joining us?

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.279
Fantastic!

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:06.678
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

00:36:06.678 --> 00:36:08.944
Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

00:36:08.944 --> 00:36:12.618
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

00:36:12.618 --> 00:36:15.291
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:17.051
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

00:36:17.051 --> 00:36:19.460
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.562
Actually, it's pronounced...
"Badassatron,"

00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:25.664
in case you were wondering.

00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:28.964
Badassatron.

00:36:28.964 --> 00:36:30.966
You like that, right?

00:36:30.966 --> 00:36:33.166
Badass--
I'm gonna need you
to talk less.

00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:34.937
Sure! No-- Yeah, no problem.

00:36:34.937 --> 00:36:36.642
What am I talking less about,
my nickname?

00:36:36.642 --> 00:36:38.941
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:40.844
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

00:36:40.844 --> 00:36:42.813
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

00:36:42.813 --> 00:36:44.111
I can't help it.

00:36:44.111 --> 00:36:46.388
D, we're really doing this.

00:36:46.388 --> 00:36:49.853
So glad
I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

00:36:49.853 --> 00:36:51.492
I'm just having a good time.

00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:53.054
How much further
is the Matrix on the map?

00:36:53.054 --> 00:36:54.561
Make an educated guesstimate.

00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:56.530
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.499
to anyone anywhere,
I'm telling you!

00:36:58.499 --> 00:37:00.897
<i>♪ Not one, not two
Not three, but four ♪</i>

00:37:00.897 --> 00:37:04.164
<i>♪ Four best friends who are
Walking through the door ♪</i>

00:37:04.164 --> 00:37:05.572
There's no doors,
we're outside.

00:37:05.572 --> 00:37:07.068
Hey, look,
there's more of it over here.

00:37:07.068 --> 00:37:09.675
What is it?
It's not metal.

00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:13.140
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.548
So are they.

00:37:14.548 --> 00:37:16.143
<i>♪ Going to the Matrix ♪</i>

00:37:16.143 --> 00:37:17.683
<i>♪ With my best friends ♪</i>

00:37:17.683 --> 00:37:19.718
What was that?

00:37:30.058 --> 00:37:32.060
Um...

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.601
I think this is not right.
We should go.

00:37:34.601 --> 00:37:36.438
Yeah, good idea.
Run!

00:37:36.438 --> 00:37:38.506
What are we running from?

00:38:03.223 --> 00:38:05.566
What is that?
Oh, no.

00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:07.733
It's a Quintesson ship.
What?

00:38:07.733 --> 00:38:10.439
What do we do?
What do we do?
Shh! Quiet.

00:38:21.012 --> 00:38:23.320
It's scanning for life-forms.
Move, move!

00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:30.283
Wait!

00:38:33.662 --> 00:38:35.123
Go, go, go, go!

00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:44.264
Come on!

00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:46.002
They're not gonna make it.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.276
Whoa.

00:39:13.163 --> 00:39:15.163
What-- What were they
searching for?

00:39:15.163 --> 00:39:17.000
Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.068
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:21.444
This way.
We're close.

00:39:21.444 --> 00:39:24.238
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

00:39:24.238 --> 00:39:26.911
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.508
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:02.177
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

00:40:03.213 --> 00:40:04.685
Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:06.753
Okay, yep, we're going in.

00:40:06.753 --> 00:40:09.052
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:10.559
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

00:40:12.354 --> 00:40:13.628
This is ridiculous.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.983
I don't believe it.

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:41.117
The Primes.

00:40:42.758 --> 00:40:43.889
We're here.

00:41:19.828 --> 00:41:21.861
Megatronus Prime.

00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:37.646
Zeta Prime.

00:41:40.618 --> 00:41:41.980
The Matrix!

00:41:45.282 --> 00:41:46.556
It's gone.

00:41:49.022 --> 00:41:50.483
Let's keep looking.

00:42:17.688 --> 00:42:18.720
Hey, guys!

00:42:36.773 --> 00:42:38.608
It's Alpha Trion!

00:42:39.336 --> 00:42:40.709
He's powered down.

00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:44.372
But his spark is still lit.

00:43:02.458 --> 00:43:04.766
Quintesson ambush!

00:43:04.766 --> 00:43:06.361
Attack!

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:10.596
Message before--

00:43:10.596 --> 00:43:12.807
Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

00:43:13.403 --> 00:43:14.644
You're safe now.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.371
The war is over.

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:40.362
I failed you, old friend.

00:43:41.431 --> 00:43:45.367
You deserved
so much better than this end.

00:43:45.367 --> 00:43:47.974
No, you didn't fail.

00:43:47.974 --> 00:43:50.812
We heard your message.
We've come to find
the Matrix.

00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:54.013
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

00:43:54.609 --> 00:43:55.916
Who are you?

00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:58.281
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:01.383
Miners? Why?

00:44:01.383 --> 00:44:02.824
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

00:44:02.824 --> 00:44:04.958
ever since
it stopped flowing.

00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:06.256
Impossible.

00:44:06.256 --> 00:44:08.489
That's why we came.
To fix things.

00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:10.557
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

00:44:10.557 --> 00:44:12.295
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:15.672
Sentinel is no Prime.

00:44:17.038 --> 00:44:19.434
What?
He's broken.
Fantastic.

00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:21.271
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

00:44:21.271 --> 00:44:23.174
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

00:44:23.174 --> 00:44:25.308
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

00:44:25.308 --> 00:44:29.279
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

00:44:29.279 --> 00:44:32.282
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

00:44:32.282 --> 00:44:35.417
Come. I will show you.

00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:44.899
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:48.001
had been a brutal conflict.

00:44:52.238 --> 00:44:56.207
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide
to the Primes,</i>

00:44:56.207 --> 00:44:59.210
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i>

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:04.116
<i>There was going to be
a secret gathering
of Quintesson commanders.</i>

00:45:04.116 --> 00:45:06.888
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i>

00:45:06.888 --> 00:45:13.059
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:17.327
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

00:45:17.327 --> 00:45:19.967
here in this cave.

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.727
But we were not alone.

00:45:24.037 --> 00:45:25.566
Quintessons!
They're here!

00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:27.073
It's a trap!
Battle positions!

00:45:27.073 --> 00:45:29.537
Hold the line!
Primus be with us!

00:45:32.377 --> 00:45:34.641
For Cybertron!

00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:43.353
<i>We were outnumbered,
but stood as one.</i>

00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:47.588
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:53.066
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

00:46:17.893 --> 00:46:20.555
Sentinel, why?

00:46:20.555 --> 00:46:23.096
For all the power
of Cybertron.

00:46:26.332 --> 00:46:32.666
<i>But Sentinel never
understood the true power
of what he desired.</i>

00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:36.736
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

00:46:36.736 --> 00:46:41.708
<i>by one that Primus himself
deems worthy.</i>

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:47.417
<i>And Sentinel
most certainly was not.</i>

00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:49.485
No!

00:46:52.457 --> 00:46:58.791
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:00.463
No.

00:47:00.463 --> 00:47:02.872
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

00:47:02.872 --> 00:47:04.731
Why would Sentinel
do that?

00:47:04.731 --> 00:47:06.337
To make a bargain.

00:47:06.337 --> 00:47:08.273
A bargain? With who?

00:47:11.012 --> 00:47:14.510
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

00:47:19.649 --> 00:47:21.484
The Quintessons.

00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:22.716
There are so many.

00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:46.047
He's here.

00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:49.281
Sentinel Prime is here.

00:48:22.382 --> 00:48:25.416
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

00:49:06.459 --> 00:49:07.997
I load those crates.

00:49:07.997 --> 00:49:10.428
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

00:49:10.428 --> 00:49:12.133
I don't understand.

00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:14.762
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

00:49:19.307 --> 00:49:21.109
Our Energon.

00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:29.315
Traitor!
D, no.

00:49:41.956 --> 00:49:44.495
I know what
I promised you

00:49:44.495 --> 00:49:47.630
but our mines,
they're running out!

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.830
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

00:49:52.404 --> 00:49:54.637
I swear I will
get you the rest.

00:50:00.348 --> 00:50:02.183
Triple-time
every mining shift.

00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:04.878
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

00:50:04.878 --> 00:50:06.550
All of it! Let's go.

00:50:22.799 --> 00:50:26.405
Now you have seen the truth.

00:50:29.872 --> 00:50:31.344
Every day...

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:37.944
Every single day
of my life

00:50:37.944 --> 00:50:40.518
has been a lie.

00:50:41.356 --> 00:50:43.015
My God, I knew it!

00:50:43.015 --> 00:50:45.886
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

00:50:45.886 --> 00:50:48.394
He deceived everyone.

00:50:48.394 --> 00:50:53.564
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

00:50:53.564 --> 00:50:55.335
I can't believe it.

00:50:55.335 --> 00:50:56.864
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

00:50:56.864 --> 00:50:58.701
I just saw it,
but I still...

00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:00.736
I can't believe it.

00:51:00.736 --> 00:51:03.739
Sentinel lied

00:51:03.739 --> 00:51:05.873
to my face.
It was all a sham.

00:51:05.873 --> 00:51:08.711
How could we
have been so gullible?

00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:12.352
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:19.359
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

00:51:19.955 --> 00:51:21.691
Me? What did I do?

00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:23.528
You just had
to go to the surface,

00:51:23.528 --> 00:51:25.563
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

00:51:25.563 --> 00:51:28.137
You just had to break protocol!

00:51:28.137 --> 00:51:30.403
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

00:51:30.966 --> 00:51:32.570
I care!

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.210
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:36.706
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

00:51:36.706 --> 00:51:39.071
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:42.778
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

00:51:42.778 --> 00:51:45.781
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

00:51:45.781 --> 00:51:47.882
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

00:51:47.882 --> 00:51:49.554
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

00:51:49.554 --> 00:51:51.325
That's the whole thing!

00:51:51.325 --> 00:51:53.723
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

00:51:53.723 --> 00:51:58.057
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

00:51:58.057 --> 00:51:59.432
Don't you want
to stop him?

00:51:59.432 --> 00:52:01.335
No, I want to kill him!

00:52:02.602 --> 00:52:04.272
I want to put Sentinel in chains

00:52:04.272 --> 00:52:05.933
and march him
through the mines

00:52:05.933 --> 00:52:09.475
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

00:52:09.475 --> 00:52:13.413
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.108
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

00:52:16.108 --> 00:52:17.747
what I want, right, Pax?

00:52:17.747 --> 00:52:21.355
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

00:52:23.018 --> 00:52:28.197
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

00:52:29.497 --> 00:52:34.467
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

00:52:34.467 --> 00:52:37.404
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:40.374
and this slot's
always been empty.

00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:42.409
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:46.006
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

00:52:46.006 --> 00:52:50.450
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:55.653
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

00:52:55.653 --> 00:52:57.622
He took them from us.

00:52:57.622 --> 00:53:00.856
What defines a Transformer...

00:53:00.856 --> 00:53:03.331
...is not the cog
in his chest

00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:08.369
but the spark
that resides in their core.

00:53:08.369 --> 00:53:13.704
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:18.203
My fellow Primes had that spark.

00:53:18.203 --> 00:53:22.251
And I see their strength
in you.

00:53:23.815 --> 00:53:30.325
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.459
Prima.

00:53:33.924 --> 00:53:34.989
Onyx.

00:53:35.596 --> 00:53:37.123
Alchemist.

00:53:37.895 --> 00:53:39.334
Micronus.

00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:45.164
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

00:53:45.164 --> 00:53:49.168
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

00:54:16.032 --> 00:54:20.441
They were one. You are one.

00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:23.312
All are one!

00:54:36.492 --> 00:54:39.955
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

00:54:39.955 --> 00:54:43.464
The ability
to change your world.

00:54:43.464 --> 00:54:48.634
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

00:54:53.573 --> 00:54:54.904
They've found us.

00:54:54.904 --> 00:54:57.610
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.482
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

00:55:04.685 --> 00:55:07.983
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

00:55:07.983 --> 00:55:10.458
Use it to reveal the truth.

00:55:11.626 --> 00:55:12.823
We will.

00:55:12.823 --> 00:55:14.957
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:17.828
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

00:55:17.828 --> 00:55:19.324
We're out of time.

00:55:19.324 --> 00:55:20.963
We got to move!

00:55:20.963 --> 00:55:23.735
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

00:55:23.735 --> 00:55:26.298
Your fight will come,
my friend.

00:55:26.298 --> 00:55:29.675
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

00:55:29.675 --> 00:55:31.611
But this fight...

00:55:31.611 --> 00:55:33.514
This fight is mine.

00:55:33.514 --> 00:55:36.011
Now go!

00:55:47.024 --> 00:55:48.430
Stand down, old timer.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.433
Ah. Old, you say?

00:56:21.256 --> 00:56:23.223
Not too old for you.

00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:30.230
We need to hurry!

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:31.935
I still think
we have better odds

00:56:31.935 --> 00:56:33.706
fighting than outrunning them.

00:56:33.706 --> 00:56:36.742
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

00:56:36.742 --> 00:56:39.712
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

00:56:39.712 --> 00:56:41.373
On three. One--

00:56:49.955 --> 00:56:50.855
Ah!

00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:58.192
How do we use these things?

00:56:58.192 --> 00:57:00.128
I don't know. Just try.

00:57:02.031 --> 00:57:04.704
It's working. Ha! It's working!

00:57:05.465 --> 00:57:06.541
My head! My head!

00:57:06.541 --> 00:57:07.608
Whoa!

00:57:07.608 --> 00:57:09.445
Help! Help!

00:57:14.111 --> 00:57:16.650
This is not faster!

00:57:19.785 --> 00:57:21.556
Oh, come on!

00:57:21.556 --> 00:57:24.658
And transform!

00:57:26.957 --> 00:57:28.695
Wheels! I need wheels!

00:57:38.498 --> 00:57:39.398
Whoa.

00:58:00.124 --> 00:58:02.663
Ha!

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.129
Oh, wow.

00:58:07.129 --> 00:58:08.669
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

00:58:08.669 --> 00:58:11.463
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

00:58:18.679 --> 00:58:19.911
Yes!

00:58:22.947 --> 00:58:24.509
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

00:58:24.509 --> 00:58:28.183
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:30.350
We transform!

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:31.989
Oh, hey! I know.

00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:34.090
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:35.289
Looks like the fastest way

00:58:35.289 --> 00:58:37.027
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

00:58:37.027 --> 00:58:38.523
Hey, what are you doing?

00:58:38.523 --> 00:58:40.228
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

00:58:40.228 --> 00:58:43.066
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

00:58:44.366 --> 00:58:49.743
I... got... it.

00:58:51.747 --> 00:58:53.010
Okay.

00:58:56.917 --> 00:58:58.279
Follow me.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.387
Alpha Trion!

00:59:07.387 --> 00:59:10.225
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

00:59:11.096 --> 00:59:13.030
You look horrible.

00:59:13.802 --> 00:59:18.167
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

00:59:18.167 --> 00:59:21.434
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:25.240
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.714
Anything to get
out of working for you

00:59:26.714 --> 00:59:29.079
and that boring
council of elders.

00:59:29.079 --> 00:59:31.279
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

00:59:31.279 --> 00:59:33.413
spend half the day
losing a war

00:59:33.413 --> 00:59:38.253
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

00:59:38.253 --> 00:59:39.551
And now look at you.

00:59:39.551 --> 00:59:43.390
Hear my words:
You will fall.

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.458
And a new Prime will rise--

00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:46.998
There you go again.

00:59:46.998 --> 00:59:49.935
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

00:59:51.266 --> 00:59:52.740
There were others
in the cave with you.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.807
Who are they?

00:59:53.807 --> 00:59:56.942
They are to be your undoing.

00:59:56.942 --> 01:00:01.375
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.483
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:12.122
You heard me, right?

01:00:12.122 --> 01:00:14.553
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

01:00:14.553 --> 01:00:17.457
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

01:00:19.063 --> 01:00:21.296
Okay. Hunt down the others.

01:00:21.296 --> 01:00:22.638
With pleasure.

01:00:39.283 --> 01:00:40.480
Hey, buddy.

01:00:41.153 --> 01:00:42.515
Oh. Hey.

01:00:44.189 --> 01:00:47.322
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

01:00:47.322 --> 01:00:51.656
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

01:00:51.656 --> 01:00:55.495
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

01:00:55.495 --> 01:00:59.708
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:02.810
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:04.812
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

01:01:04.812 --> 01:01:07.078
They worship Sentinel.

01:01:07.078 --> 01:01:09.113
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

01:01:09.113 --> 01:01:11.819
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:13.920
I trusted Sentinel!

01:01:14.516 --> 01:01:15.614
With everything.

01:01:16.793 --> 01:01:22.093
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

01:01:24.691 --> 01:01:26.427
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:39.275
All right,
wake them up.

01:02:02.201 --> 01:02:05.466
Now, are you spies

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:09.778
or just incompetent lackeys?

01:02:09.778 --> 01:02:12.605
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:16.950
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:21.515
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

01:02:23.517 --> 01:02:26.058
Uh, why is he gagged?

01:02:26.058 --> 01:02:27.752
He wouldn't stop talking.

01:02:27.752 --> 01:02:29.292
Even when he was
unconscious?

01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:31.525
Especially when
he was unconscious!

01:02:31.525 --> 01:02:32.768
Enough!

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:35.364
Two options for you!

01:02:35.364 --> 01:02:40.072
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

01:02:40.072 --> 01:02:42.734
and really make sure
you feel it.

01:02:42.734 --> 01:02:43.878
Or two:

01:02:43.878 --> 01:02:45.671
In exchange
for a quick death,

01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:48.113
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

01:02:48.113 --> 01:02:50.115
access to the mines

01:02:50.115 --> 01:02:53.822
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

01:02:53.822 --> 01:02:55.351
Who exactly are you guys?

01:02:57.056 --> 01:02:58.123
Ah!

01:02:58.123 --> 01:03:01.192
The Cybertronian High Guard!

01:03:01.192 --> 01:03:03.095
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

01:03:03.095 --> 01:03:06.230
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.969
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

01:03:08.969 --> 01:03:12.401
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:14.205
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

01:03:14.205 --> 01:03:17.109
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:19.738
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

01:03:19.738 --> 01:03:21.311
Silence!

01:03:21.311 --> 01:03:23.445
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

01:03:23.445 --> 01:03:24.446
Whoo!

01:03:24.446 --> 01:03:26.283
We were once the High Guard.

01:03:26.283 --> 01:03:30.023
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:32.927
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

01:03:32.927 --> 01:03:35.655
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

01:03:35.655 --> 01:03:37.393
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:41.100
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.597
I'm just saying we're allies.

01:03:43.597 --> 01:03:45.665
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

01:03:45.665 --> 01:03:49.735
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

01:03:49.735 --> 01:03:53.882
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

01:03:53.882 --> 01:03:58.744
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:03.617
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

01:04:03.617 --> 01:04:05.553
Yeah. Just a little.

01:04:05.553 --> 01:04:06.928
Hey!

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:08.490
What are you doing?

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.726
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

01:04:13.726 --> 01:04:17.664
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

01:04:17.664 --> 01:04:19.864
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:22.603
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

01:04:22.603 --> 01:04:24.869
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:26.871
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:28.378
Today!

01:04:28.378 --> 01:04:31.986
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

01:04:31.986 --> 01:04:36.023
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

01:04:36.023 --> 01:04:37.684
Is that right?

01:04:38.687 --> 01:04:40.852
Well, how can you say so

01:04:40.852 --> 01:04:42.821
with my head in your teeth?

01:04:42.821 --> 01:04:44.493
D!

01:04:51.403 --> 01:04:52.435
Whoa!

01:04:57.574 --> 01:04:58.903
Hit me!

01:04:58.903 --> 01:05:02.181
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

01:05:02.181 --> 01:05:05.712
D-16! D-16! D-16!

01:05:07.914 --> 01:05:12.884
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

01:05:12.884 --> 01:05:14.963
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:17.757
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:37.480
Please! I beg you!

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.318
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

01:05:42.652 --> 01:05:44.784
Bear witness!

01:05:44.784 --> 01:05:47.589
This is the last time
I show mercy!

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:50.262
Decide right now:

01:05:50.262 --> 01:05:54.893
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

01:05:54.893 --> 01:05:58.237
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

01:05:58.237 --> 01:06:01.801
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

01:06:04.276 --> 01:06:08.874
D-16! D-16! D-16!

01:06:35.738 --> 01:06:36.968
B, come on!

01:07:01.995 --> 01:07:04.765
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

01:07:36.535 --> 01:07:37.435
Elita, get down!

01:08:00.053 --> 01:08:02.691
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

01:08:02.691 --> 01:08:05.232
Where are the others?

01:08:05.232 --> 01:08:09.027
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

01:08:09.027 --> 01:08:10.831
They got D-16 and B.

01:08:10.831 --> 01:08:12.701
Oh, no.

01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:15.275
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

01:08:17.277 --> 01:08:19.004
Our proof.

01:08:19.004 --> 01:08:20.445
It's gone.

01:08:21.316 --> 01:08:23.580
So, what do we do now?

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.186
D was right.

01:08:25.186 --> 01:08:27.782
About what?
Everything.

01:08:27.782 --> 01:08:31.423
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

01:08:31.986 --> 01:08:33.161
It's all my fault.

01:08:33.161 --> 01:08:35.086
I should have
stayed on protocol.

01:08:41.369 --> 01:08:44.766
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

01:08:44.766 --> 01:08:45.833
Are you listening?

01:08:48.442 --> 01:08:49.837
I'm better than you.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.477
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

01:08:53.348 --> 01:08:55.106
I'm better than you
in every way,

01:08:55.106 --> 01:08:57.614
except you have hope.

01:08:57.614 --> 01:09:01.321
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

01:09:01.321 --> 01:09:05.292
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:07.118
Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

01:09:07.118 --> 01:09:08.889
My point is,

01:09:08.889 --> 01:09:13.157
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

01:09:13.157 --> 01:09:16.270
This blind optimism
that you have

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:20.637
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

01:09:21.706 --> 01:09:23.508
that are also extremely stupid.

01:09:23.508 --> 01:09:26.071
First time
giving a pep talk?

01:09:26.071 --> 01:09:27.842
You're inspiring.

01:09:27.842 --> 01:09:31.219
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

01:09:32.288 --> 01:09:35.322
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

01:09:35.322 --> 01:09:39.359
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.592
Listen to me.

01:09:42.496 --> 01:09:43.693
We can do this.

01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:49.369
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

01:09:49.369 --> 01:09:52.097
If we intercepted one--

01:09:52.097 --> 01:09:55.309
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

01:09:55.309 --> 01:10:00.039
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

01:10:02.076 --> 01:10:04.384
I was afraid
you'd say that.

01:10:04.384 --> 01:10:07.981
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

01:10:07.981 --> 01:10:11.259
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

01:10:11.259 --> 01:10:13.558
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

01:10:13.558 --> 01:10:16.990
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:20.235
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.063
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

01:10:24.063 --> 01:10:25.735
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

01:10:25.735 --> 01:10:28.771
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

01:10:28.771 --> 01:10:33.743
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

01:10:33.743 --> 01:10:36.911
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

01:10:36.911 --> 01:10:38.550
Why should we follow you?

01:10:39.718 --> 01:10:41.388
We will follow you.

01:10:41.388 --> 01:10:44.622
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

01:10:44.622 --> 01:10:46.657
What is our first move?

01:10:46.657 --> 01:10:47.823
We roll out.

01:10:49.398 --> 01:10:50.430
What?

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:51.860
Louder.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.302
Transform and roll out!

01:11:04.204 --> 01:11:07.843
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

01:11:07.843 --> 01:11:11.451
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:13.321
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:16.918
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

01:11:16.918 --> 01:11:19.459
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:20.790
Oh-ho-ho!

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:23.727
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

01:11:23.727 --> 01:11:25.927
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

01:11:25.927 --> 01:11:27.434
so that your death
is painful!

01:11:27.434 --> 01:11:28.732
You'll regret
the day you were--

01:11:28.732 --> 01:11:30.701
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

01:11:30.701 --> 01:11:33.737
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

01:11:33.737 --> 01:11:37.642
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

01:11:37.642 --> 01:11:39.743
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

01:11:39.743 --> 01:11:42.482
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:46.178
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:48.620
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:49.918
None of that is true!

01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:51.524
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:54.461
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

01:11:54.461 --> 01:11:58.289
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:09.443
Well, well.
What's this about?

01:12:10.303 --> 01:12:13.007
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:14.976
Feeling confident, are we?

01:12:14.976 --> 01:12:18.210
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:19.310
Please.

01:12:20.522 --> 01:12:23.556
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.723
You took it all.

01:12:27.089 --> 01:12:28.462
I sure did.

01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:33.929
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:38.406
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

01:12:38.406 --> 01:12:41.299
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

01:12:42.544 --> 01:12:44.775
That's why,
after I killed him,

01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:48.042
I took his cog for myself.

01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:50.550
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:52.849
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

01:12:52.849 --> 01:12:55.720
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.787
Here.

01:12:58.021 --> 01:13:01.253
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:22.549
Okay.

01:13:22.549 --> 01:13:25.112
I can do this.

01:13:38.765 --> 01:13:42.261
You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

01:13:42.261 --> 01:13:43.999
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:46.298
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

01:13:46.298 --> 01:13:49.741
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

01:13:55.406 --> 01:13:57.408
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

01:13:57.408 --> 01:13:58.618
That can't be him.

01:13:58.618 --> 01:13:59.718
Is that...

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.413
It can't be.

01:14:02.413 --> 01:14:04.954
Orion?
Jazz.

01:14:04.954 --> 01:14:06.384
Is it really you?

01:14:06.384 --> 01:14:08.793
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

01:14:08.793 --> 01:14:10.388
"Little"?

01:14:10.388 --> 01:14:12.225
There's nothing
"little" about you.

01:14:12.225 --> 01:14:14.095
Uh, how is this possible?

01:14:14.095 --> 01:14:16.933
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:19.903
Sentinel is a liar.

01:14:19.903 --> 01:14:21.938
What?
Huh?

01:14:21.938 --> 01:14:24.105
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

01:14:24.105 --> 01:14:27.614
I was never
the most focused miner.

01:14:27.614 --> 01:14:30.078
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

01:14:37.923 --> 01:14:42.156
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

01:14:43.632 --> 01:14:45.291
My friends,

01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:49.394
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.607
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

01:14:53.607 --> 01:14:57.006
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

01:14:57.006 --> 01:14:59.173
He stole our freedom.

01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:08.820
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.956
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

01:15:14.663 --> 01:15:17.488
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

01:15:18.029 --> 01:15:20.161
Right now.

01:15:20.161 --> 01:15:23.538
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

01:15:25.872 --> 01:15:29.808
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

01:15:29.808 --> 01:15:32.778
but the spark
that resides in their core.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:36.947
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

01:15:36.947 --> 01:15:40.819
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

01:15:40.819 --> 01:15:43.217
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

01:15:43.217 --> 01:15:46.990
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:49.058
We are not alone in this.

01:15:49.058 --> 01:15:51.863
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

01:15:51.863 --> 01:15:53.524
we will have to
fight for it.

01:15:53.524 --> 01:15:56.901
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

01:15:56.901 --> 01:15:58.903
...for ourselves.

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:03.171
Stand up for this injustice.

01:16:05.371 --> 01:16:09.078
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:11.751
Follow me.

01:16:11.751 --> 01:16:14.655
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:18.186
Together as one.

01:16:18.186 --> 01:16:22.696
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

01:16:22.696 --> 01:16:25.193
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

01:16:25.193 --> 01:16:26.524
You got it.

01:16:26.524 --> 01:16:28.801
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

01:16:42.212 --> 01:16:43.442
Not a good idea.

01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.787
D, stay down.

01:16:59.592 --> 01:17:01.427
Well, that's a shame.

01:17:01.427 --> 01:17:03.396
You really were
a great miner.

01:17:07.908 --> 01:17:10.337
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

01:17:19.579 --> 01:17:22.151
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

01:17:23.088 --> 01:17:24.791
High Guard, eject.

01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:26.760
Come on! Move out!

01:17:41.634 --> 01:17:43.777
There's too many.
We have to abort!

01:17:49.411 --> 01:17:50.476
We're not gonna make it.

01:17:53.349 --> 01:17:54.315
Whoo-hoo!

01:17:54.315 --> 01:17:55.921
Metal to the pedal, miners!

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.681
Let's break some protocol!

01:17:57.681 --> 01:17:59.452
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.365
Whoa! That's intense.

01:18:11.365 --> 01:18:16.073
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.977
That's right, you do.

01:18:18.977 --> 01:18:21.716
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

01:18:34.687 --> 01:18:36.357
What's going on?

01:18:40.526 --> 01:18:41.736
Hey!

01:18:47.205 --> 01:18:49.007
What has he done to you?

01:18:49.007 --> 01:18:51.878
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:55.079
Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

01:18:59.745 --> 01:19:02.086
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

01:19:02.086 --> 01:19:03.857
I'm doing this my way.
D!

01:19:09.392 --> 01:19:10.424
Yes!

01:19:10.424 --> 01:19:11.491
Whoa!

01:19:11.491 --> 01:19:13.031
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:19:13.031 --> 01:19:14.395
I got a battle mask!

01:19:16.133 --> 01:19:18.069
Elita! Battle mask!

01:19:18.069 --> 01:19:21.039
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

01:19:21.039 --> 01:19:23.074
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

01:19:26.079 --> 01:19:27.144
What the--?

01:19:30.147 --> 01:19:31.951
Badassatron.

01:19:37.255 --> 01:19:39.156
Where's Sentinel?

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.963
You pathetic little twits.

01:19:43.963 --> 01:19:48.297
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

01:19:48.297 --> 01:19:52.136
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
What truth?

01:19:52.136 --> 01:19:54.842
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

01:19:54.842 --> 01:19:57.042
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.406
and live like a king?

01:19:58.406 --> 01:20:01.409
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

01:20:01.409 --> 01:20:05.413
...is what I make it.

01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:08.515
Incoming!

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.683
Whoa!

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:17.095
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

01:20:17.095 --> 01:20:19.295
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

01:20:19.295 --> 01:20:21.561
We need her memory.
Where is she?

01:20:21.561 --> 01:20:23.167
Found her!

01:20:24.698 --> 01:20:25.664
Elita!

01:20:26.535 --> 01:20:27.941
<i>Do not break her.</i>

01:20:27.941 --> 01:20:29.272
<i>Bring her
to the broadcast station.</i>

01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:30.504
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

01:20:30.504 --> 01:20:32.473
Easier said than done.

01:20:51.527 --> 01:20:52.790
<i>I said,
don't break her!</i>

01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:55.826
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:03.009
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

01:21:03.009 --> 01:21:04.604
I can see that.

01:21:04.604 --> 01:21:06.804
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

01:21:06.804 --> 01:21:08.674
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.052
Yeah!

01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:34.568
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

01:21:41.841 --> 01:21:43.511
B!

01:21:43.511 --> 01:21:46.349
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

01:21:46.349 --> 01:21:48.989
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

01:21:48.989 --> 01:21:50.617
It was already like that.
Right?

01:21:50.617 --> 01:21:51.959
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

01:21:51.959 --> 01:21:54.060
Yeah, it was already like--
Yes. Mm-hmm.

01:21:58.726 --> 01:22:00.594
<i>Attention, Iacon City.</i>

01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:03.971
<i>Stand by for
a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:11.341
What's wrong, D-16?

01:22:12.278 --> 01:22:13.442
Rise up!

01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:19.085
<i>That's why after I killed him--</i>

01:22:19.085 --> 01:22:23.221
<i>That's why after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself.</i>

01:22:23.221 --> 01:22:25.553
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

01:22:25.553 --> 01:22:29.392
<i>What truth?
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

01:22:29.392 --> 01:22:31.097
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

01:22:31.097 --> 01:22:32.956
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

01:22:32.956 --> 01:22:34.661
<i>What truth?</i>

01:22:34.661 --> 01:22:36.597
<i>That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

01:22:36.597 --> 01:22:38.302
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

01:22:38.302 --> 01:22:40.469
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

01:22:40.469 --> 01:22:42.306
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

01:22:42.306 --> 01:22:45.276
<i>I swear I will
get you the rest!</i>

01:22:45.276 --> 01:22:47.443
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

01:22:47.443 --> 01:22:50.248
<i>I swear I will
get you the rest!</i>

01:22:50.248 --> 01:22:52.613
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can, I swear--</i>

01:22:52.613 --> 01:22:54.252
Liar!

01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:58.916
We trusted you!

01:22:59.589 --> 01:23:00.621
Traitor!

01:23:00.621 --> 01:23:02.689
Pax, we did it.

01:23:14.307 --> 01:23:15.471
D!

01:23:43.369 --> 01:23:44.401
D-16.

01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:47.701
We can lead Cybertron together!

01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:49.109
Don't do this!

01:23:55.346 --> 01:23:56.512
What are you doing?

01:23:56.512 --> 01:23:58.151
It's over, D.

01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:00.318
Everyone in Iacon
knows the truth.

01:24:00.318 --> 01:24:01.979
So do I!

01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:05.158
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

01:24:05.158 --> 01:24:06.819
No, you don't.

01:24:06.819 --> 01:24:10.526
Rebuilding Iacon
cannot begin
with an execution.

01:24:10.526 --> 01:24:13.056
He deserves to die!
Can't you see that?

01:24:13.056 --> 01:24:16.070
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:19.733
Pax,

01:24:19.733 --> 01:24:23.803
you need to move
out of my way
before I move you myself.

01:24:23.803 --> 01:24:26.003
D, listen--

01:24:34.112 --> 01:24:35.386
Stop!

01:24:47.268 --> 01:24:48.366
No!

01:24:48.366 --> 01:24:50.434
No, no, no, no. Why?

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.866
Why did you do that? Why?

01:25:03.282 --> 01:25:05.977
D, no.

01:25:12.051 --> 01:25:13.523
I'm done saving you.

01:26:53.427 --> 01:26:56.461
The Age of Primes has ended!

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:58.826
No more false prophets!

01:26:58.826 --> 01:27:03.094
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

01:27:03.899 --> 01:27:06.438
Rise up!

01:27:06.438 --> 01:27:08.506
Rise up! Rise up!

01:27:08.506 --> 01:27:11.707
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

01:27:11.707 --> 01:27:14.072
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

01:27:14.072 --> 01:27:17.207
<i>your noble sacrifice
for the greater good</i>

01:27:17.207 --> 01:27:21.255
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i>

01:27:22.049 --> 01:27:24.522
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

01:27:24.522 --> 01:27:27.426
the future of Cybertron

01:27:27.426 --> 01:27:33.058
and the Matrix of Leadership!

01:27:34.257 --> 01:27:37.667
I will lead us all
into the future!

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:55.751
I...

01:27:56.523 --> 01:27:57.588
am...

01:27:58.459 --> 01:28:00.294
Megatron!

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:02.923
<i>Arise...</i>

01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:06.058
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:10.931
Burn it down!

01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:12.933
All of it!

01:28:18.336 --> 01:28:21.513
All hail Megatron!

01:28:23.418 --> 01:28:25.913
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

01:28:27.422 --> 01:28:29.114
Stop! It's over.

01:28:29.114 --> 01:28:32.887
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

01:29:06.351 --> 01:29:07.823
Impossible.

01:29:10.498 --> 01:29:14.357
Primus gave you the Matrix.

01:29:14.357 --> 01:29:16.568
We could've built
the future together.

01:29:16.568 --> 01:29:18.603
I'll build it myself.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.200
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

01:30:03.782 --> 01:30:04.814
Ah!

01:31:06.944 --> 01:31:10.143
We were given the power
to change our world

01:31:10.143 --> 01:31:12.651
and you chose to destroy it.

01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:14.114
Just like Sentinel.

01:31:14.114 --> 01:31:17.986
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.452
And you betrayed me.

01:31:33.531 --> 01:31:34.607
Go.

01:31:35.467 --> 01:31:38.138
Take the High Guard
and leave.

01:31:39.372 --> 01:31:42.978
You are banished from Iacon.

01:31:47.853 --> 01:31:50.183
It didn't have to end
this way.

01:31:52.517 --> 01:31:55.991
This isn't over, Prime.

01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:05.902
High Guard, follow me!

01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:22.050
<i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:25.218
<i>is not as clear
as I once believed.</i>

01:32:25.218 --> 01:32:29.156
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

01:32:29.156 --> 01:32:33.193
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

01:32:33.193 --> 01:32:35.063
Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

01:32:35.063 --> 01:32:37.230
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:39.067
The greatest Prime
to ever live.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.566
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

01:32:43.566 --> 01:32:45.975
You ever mine Energon before?

01:32:45.975 --> 01:32:47.372
No. You?

01:32:47.372 --> 01:32:49.583
No. I hear it's dangerous.

01:32:50.278 --> 01:32:51.684
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:32:51.684 --> 01:32:54.214
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

01:32:54.214 --> 01:32:55.413
All right.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.251
Thanks, Pax.

01:33:11.299 --> 01:33:13.596
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

01:33:13.596 --> 01:33:15.708
And a new leader.

01:33:15.708 --> 01:33:17.710
Yes, about that.

01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:22.715
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

01:33:22.715 --> 01:33:24.684
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

01:33:24.684 --> 01:33:27.082
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

01:33:27.082 --> 01:33:30.085
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

01:33:30.085 --> 01:33:32.857
How's Major Elita sound?

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:35.420
How about Commander?

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.389
Even better.

01:33:37.389 --> 01:33:41.360
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.197
I may be a Prime now,

01:33:43.197 --> 01:33:44.935
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:48.433
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:50.633
I get to work
for the government.

01:33:50.633 --> 01:33:54.274
Okay. So that's new.

01:33:54.274 --> 01:33:55.946
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

01:34:26.374 --> 01:34:30.112
<i>And now we stand here
together as one...</i>

01:34:32.512 --> 01:34:35.645
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

01:34:35.645 --> 01:34:38.890
<i>to become
who we were destined to be,</i>

01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:43.587
<i>to right wrongs,
to make our world better.</i>

01:34:43.587 --> 01:34:46.766
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i>

01:34:46.766 --> 01:34:49.494
<i>are the rights
of all sentient beings.</i>

01:34:50.596 --> 01:34:55.071
<i>Here,
all are truly Autobots.</i>

01:34:56.536 --> 01:35:00.142
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

01:35:00.142 --> 01:35:05.543
<i>If you dare
return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

01:35:05.543 --> 01:35:08.480
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.319
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

01:35:40.182 --> 01:35:42.679
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

01:35:42.679 --> 01:35:44.956
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

01:35:44.956 --> 01:35:46.892
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

01:35:46.892 --> 01:35:50.456
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

01:35:50.456 --> 01:35:52.293
Watch this. Knife hands!

01:35:54.198 --> 01:35:55.230
No!

01:43:20.072 --> 01:43:23.975
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

01:43:23.975 --> 01:43:27.715
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

01:43:27.715 --> 01:43:29.915
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

01:43:29.915 --> 01:43:32.049
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

01:43:33.184 --> 01:43:37.362
<i>We will not be blinded
by his deception.</i>

01:43:37.362 --> 01:43:40.024
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

01:43:40.862 --> 01:43:42.862
Decepticons!

01:43:42.862 --> 01:43:44.699
Rise up!

01:43:44.699 --> 01:43:48.197
Rise up! Rise up!
