WEBVTT

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:59.216
Out of the way! Clear the way!

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:31.665
Move! Move!

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:38.589
That was a full bottle, Herr Leutnant.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.800
Yes.

00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:30.344
- You've just met Willi von Klugermann.
- Yes.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.430
- I see you've heard of him.
- Oh, yes, I have.

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.974
- You must be...
- He's tearing the wings off.

00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:39.853
Let him celebrate, Ziegel. He shoots them down.

00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:42.606
Your job is to keep him up there.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.152
You must be the new replacement, Stachel.

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:50.239
Bruno Stachel, Herr Oberleutnant.
Are you the adjutant?

00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:52.699
I fly a desk now.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:54.868
Anti-aircraft fire.

00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:58.872
Still, it could have got me higher up, couldn't it?

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.541
Yes.

00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:03.544
Wait here. I'll tell the CO you've arrived.

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:06.630
And if I were you, I'd button up that jacket.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.191
Ziegel, how soon can you have us ready again?

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.111
Depends on how many of the others have been hit.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.238
I wasn't the only one.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.324
I can't keep these barges flying for ever.
I'm not a magician.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.327
No, Ziegel, you are a magician
whether you like it or not.

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:41.039
- Only 11 back, Herr Hauptmann.
- Yes. Mueller went down.

00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:43.000
He didn't last long.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.090
Fabian, how did we come to lose him?

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.426
I gave him the usual instructions, Herr Hauptmann,

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.595
but he wouldn't stay with me.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.597
Too... Too keen.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.391
Oh, by the way, Scholte's replacement's here.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.686
Leutnant Bruno Stachel reporting
from 104 training school.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.522
Your commanding officer, Hauptmann Heidemann.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.483
Ah, yes. Stachel. Come inside.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.452
Herr Hauptmann.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.537
- Stachel?
- Yes, sir.

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:27.210
Two years in the infantry. Any rank?

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.962
Corporal, Herr Hauptmann.

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:32.049
What made you transfer to the air corps?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.635
To fly, Herr Hauptmann.

00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:37.721
Are you a good flier?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.474
I'm... comfortable in the air.

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.645
Comfortable. Are you? Interesting.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.146
Willi!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.231
Willi?

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.236
Very pretty flying-

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.699
I wish you would stop it. You'll live longer.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.705
Sorry about that.

00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:07.000
I see you are from Wiesbaden.

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.753
I've done some hunting round there.

00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:13.882
- Who are your people?
- Herr Hauptmann?

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.679
I want to know something of your background.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.431
What does your father do?

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:29.773
He works in a small hotel, Herr Hauptmann.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.652
Five bedrooms.

00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:39.741
Corporal, see the new officer's bags
are taken to the mess.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.076
Herr Hauptmann.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.162
Come into my office, Stachel.

00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.459
Close the door, please.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:58.051
I'm sorry if it bothers you
about what your father does.

00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:00.804
It doesn't bother me, Herr Hauptmann.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:08.019
Then why are you so touchy about it?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.023
Well, you're an officer now.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:15.110
Your social problems are no concern of ours.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.280
Take a look at the map, Stachel.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:26.580
Our operating area is between Arras and St-Quentin.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.959
The British also operate the area...

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.336
as you'll find out.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.054
What did you train on?

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:46.933
The usual machine, Herr Hauptmann.
An out-of-date Pfalz.

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:50.604
That's what you'll fly here, too.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.690
- But at flying school they told us...
- Flying school.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:57.027
At flying school they'll tell you anything.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.113
Up-to-date machines go to experienced pilots.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.158
Both are in short supply.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:08.371
- It's a cruel world, Stachel.
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.833
Welcome to the squadron.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.878
The truck will take you to the mess with the others.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.590
And Stachel?

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.012
Let's hope you get to like us.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.896
He could have been lying about the five bedrooms.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:37.317
- His father was probably only a waiter.
- Just another snob, in fact.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.322
Willi, there's something I haven't told you.
I have an uncle in the hotel business.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.742
I admit he's a baron, and the hotel has 500 bedrooms,

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:48.829
but you do see the position it places me in.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.814
<i>There was a town in Poland</i>

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:19.860
<i>And there a girl we found</i>

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.528
<i>Lovely...</i>

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.281
- Want a cigarette?
- Thank you.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:30.537
<i>She was the loveliest maid that ever we beheld</i>

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.331
<i>But "Do not kiss me, please" she said</i>

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.041
<i>"I never kiss"</i>

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.043
You've got 18, haven't you?

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.796
Squadron rule number one, Stachel.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.258
Gentlemen never parade their military achievements.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:50.223
Any rule against saying how long it took you?

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:53.852
I would say that was covered
by the same rule, wouldn't you?

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.898
No, I wouldn't. How many rules are there?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:03.236
I don't know. None of them have been written down.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:09.659
<i>She was the haughtiest maid that ever we beheld</i>

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.370
<i>But "Do not kiss me, please" she said</i>

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.748
<i>"I never kiss"</i>

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:21.004
<i>She was the haughtiest maid that ever we beheld</i>

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.590
<i>But "Do not kiss me, please" she said</i>

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.967
<i>"I never kiss"</i>

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:54.788
It seems you're next to me
in Scholte's old room. Number 11.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.123
Scholte?

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.460
Your predecessor. He didn't last long, unfortunately.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.170
An unhappy young man.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.756
Yes, he forgot to keep looking over his shoulder.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:05.840
Worth remembering.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.593
They come fast, out of the sun.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.889
Thank you.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.149
Willi, what do you think Of him?

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.364
Gonna have a drink?

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.077
Oh.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:21.291
They haven't removed poor Scholte's card.
How very tactless of them.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:29.841
I just thought you should know
we don't dress for dinner here.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.811
Von Richthofen, I see. Your hero?

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:48.526
He's done it all. Two more kills,
you'll have one of those.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.987
Mmm.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.531
A pretty medal, the Blue Max.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.495
It's the only one worth having. People respect it.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.955
The medal or the man?

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.824
The usual routine, Fabian.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.826
You know what they're like the first time in combat.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.078
- Of course.
- Keep your eye on him.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:44.874
Here. Isn't it nice to hear
the birds again, Herr Hauptmann?

00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.127
Listen to that.

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.214
They won't be here long.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.760
When our offensive starts...

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.680
- Good luck, Fabian.
- Herr Hauptmann.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:04.435
What is it?

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:11.234
Stachel, fly on Fabian's left
and a little behind him.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.863
- Watch for his signals.
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.657
And relax. Get the balloon and come straight back.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.577
You'll find balloons burn beautifully.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.000
Switches on.

00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:48.422
Is that Army Observation?
Adjutant, squadron 11, here.

00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:51.842
One of our pilots claims an SE5
shot down in sector five.

00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:54.762
- Yes.
- Can you confirm, please?

00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:59.475
Yes. About 0700 hours.

00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:08.901
- Perhaps Fabian made a forced landing.
- I don't know.

00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:12.280
Yes? Sector five, on our side of the line.

00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:16.909
You did? Fine.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.412
Go on.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.417
In midair?

00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:28.546
- Did yours explode?
- No.

00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:34.051
Yes. We do have a pilot missing.

00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:37.722
- That'll be him, I'm afraid.
- Ask him.

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:40.308
Thanks. Goodbye.

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:45.313
- But...
- Only Fabian. He never got out. No SE5.

00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:48.441
But somebody must have seen my SE5 go down.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.652
Not necessarily.

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.198
It often happens.

00:26:56.699 --> 00:27:00.745
No confirmation, no claim. That's a squadron rule.

00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:03.331
But I saw it. It was a kill.

00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:10.755
Then you have the deep satisfaction of
knowing you have served the fatherland.

00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:21.932
It went down here, our side of the line.
Why couldn't the army look for it?

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:26.854
- They have other things to do.
- Somebody must have seen it.

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:33.944
Fabian might have seen it.

00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:56.092
Corporal Rupp? We're gonna search
sector five. Get your motorcycle.

00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:58.844
- But...
- Be in the mess in five minutes.

00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:00.012
Herr Leutnant.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.295
Back to the mess, Herr Leutnant?

00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:36.924
No, I'm gonna search that wood over there.

00:28:37.007 --> 00:28:39.427
- You already have, Herr Leutnant.
- What?

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.138
You searched that one an hour ago.

00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:45.224
Well, we're gonna search it again.

00:28:45.474 --> 00:28:48.769
What's the matter, Rupp?
Too close to the guns for you?

00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:23.220
- Thank you, Corporal.
- It's been a pleasure, Herr Leutnant.

00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:35.024
You have finished your wild-goose chase, I hope.

00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:38.611
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
- Found nothing, huh?

00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.614
No.

00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:49.038
If every pilot were to go careering around
France looking for unconfirmed aircraft,

00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:51.248
there'd be no air force left.

00:29:53.042 --> 00:29:56.086
And Corporal Rupp has more important things to do.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.464
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:03.427
"Unconfirmed by army" means
"unconfirmed," and that's final.

00:30:05.054 --> 00:30:06.263
Good night, Stachel.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.152
Stachel!

00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:22.780
Come and join us.

00:30:36.293 --> 00:30:38.879
- Brandy, please.
- Champagne, Herr Leutnant.

00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:42.424
Willi got his 20th kill today.
He's being awarded the Blue Max.

00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:44.510
Uh-huh.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:48.931
I see you've had a hard day.

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:53.310
No one's ever done that before
about an unconfirmed kill.

00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.480
Quite novel. You must be in a hurry.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.113
- To your Blue Max.
- Blue Max.

00:31:08.492 --> 00:31:10.995
I don't suppose you've had an unconfirmed kill.

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:14.248
Oh, but I have. I've had, uh... three.

00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:17.543
Then you've shot down 23?

00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:21.463
No. 20.

00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:31.432
By the way, Stachel,
there's an impression around that

00:31:31.515 --> 00:31:36.937
you care more about your unconfirmed kill
than you do about Fabian's death.

00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:50.868
Perhaps it's force of habit.

00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:54.914
In the trenches we couldn't even bury the dead.

00:31:56.332 --> 00:31:58.167
There were too many of them.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:04.173
I've never had the time to discuss them
over a glass of champagne.

00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:08.260
Well, never mind, Stachel.

00:32:08.344 --> 00:32:11.096
To your unconfirmed victory.

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.183
Next time you must have witnesses.

00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:16.518
Witnesses.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:21.190
Good evening, gentlemen.
Pairings for next week's sorties.

00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:24.610
- Let's have them.
- I'll fly with Becker.

00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:26.278
Heller and Braun.

00:32:26.362 --> 00:32:27.821
Von Klinger and I will do the ground strafe.

00:32:27.905 --> 00:32:31.241
Gruber and I will fly together.

00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:34.703
Good. Who'll fly With Stachel?

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.860
I'll fly With Stachel.

00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:04.973
He's... he's bringing her in.

00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:03.031
This one is dead, Herr Leutnant.

00:38:07.536 --> 00:38:10.831
- Easy, easy.
- Bring a stretcher! Quick! Quick!

00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:44.072
What happened, Stachel?

00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:50.746
The observer. He was going to open fire.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.964
Then we are to assume he was
either very brave... or very foolish.

00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:51.139
Confirmed.

00:39:53.308 --> 00:39:56.728
It's a cruel world, Herr Hauptmann.
You said so yourself.

00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:17.124
Bearers, halt!

00:40:29.511 --> 00:40:30.971
Willi.

00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:46.695
I've read your report, Willi. What really happened?

00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:54.035
As I said, Otto, the observer made a move
for his gun, so Stachel shot him down.

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.831
You wish to stand by your comrade. I appreciate that.

00:40:57.914 --> 00:41:01.084
What I reported is what I saw.

00:41:01.168 --> 00:41:04.129
We are German officers. We'll fight with chivalry.

00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:06.381
- You know that as well as I do.
- Of course.

00:41:10.927 --> 00:41:14.890
The observer was blinded. Did you know that?

00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:20.479
No. It could have happened when
Stachel opened fire over the field.

00:41:20.562 --> 00:41:22.230
- But did it?
- I don't know.

00:41:22.314 --> 00:41:25.567
But you do know how Stachel behaved
when his first claim was disallowed.

00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:33.575
If he's shot down a helpless enemy in cold blood,

00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:36.203
it's something I won't tolerate in my squadron.

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:41.082
All right, Otto. I agree.
There is some measure of doubt.

00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:45.378
But I have no reason to change my report.

00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:58.517
All right, Willi.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.603
The incident is closed. Officially, anyway.

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.861
Is everyone here?

00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:14.241
All except Leutnant Stachel, Herr Hauptmann.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.371
Someone inform him this is a parade.

00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:21.456
He is ordered to attend.

00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:35.303
We are about to honor your dead.

00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.807
So I see.

00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:46.523
Well... aren't you coming?

00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:49.693
It's an order.

00:42:51.361 --> 00:42:52.612
Why?

00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:55.949
Because our commanding officer has made it one.

00:42:56.533 --> 00:42:59.035
He believes in chivalry, Stachel.

00:42:59.703 --> 00:43:01.037
Chivalry?

00:43:03.582 --> 00:43:07.252
To kill a man, then make
a ritual out of saluting him?

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:10.171
It's hypocrisy.

00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:15.969
If they kill me, I don't want anyone to salute.

00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:20.056
They probably won't.

00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:30.358
All right.

00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:38.074
Let's get it over with, shall we?

00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:39.909
Stachel.

00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:44.998
Thank you.

00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:49.377
You know, there's something of the cobra in you.

00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:55.133
I'll have to watch you.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.568
Leutnant von Klugermann.

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.491
Parade, stand at ease!

00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:27.248
I assume you've talked
to the other pilots about this.

00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:30.877
Yes, I am making a thorough inquiry
into the whole incident.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.256
Good. When the opportunity arises,
point the man out to me.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.050
Yes, Herr General.

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:42.931
- Ah, Otto.
- The squadron is drawn up, Herr General.

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.809
We were discussing the pilot who brought this in.

00:44:45.892 --> 00:44:50.230
Air Headquarters are quite excited about it.
What's the man's name again?

00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.608
- Leutnant Stachel, Herr General.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.530
Is he a good flier?

00:44:58.613 --> 00:45:01.074
Yes. Yes, he is.

00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:07.706
Glad to hear it. Well, we mustn't
keep my nephew waiting any longer,

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:09.290
not to mention my wife.

00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:28.810
Parade, left turn!

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.570
Sorry to have been so long. Were you bored?

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:41.698
With all these men around?

00:45:41.781 --> 00:45:44.325
Look beautiful for them, Kaeti.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.079
Look at Willi.

00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:53.209
Doesn't he look splendid?
The Blue Max will go so well with his eyes.

00:45:54.002 --> 00:45:58.506
Yes, he is rather vain. He'll probably
wear it in bed for the first few days.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.884
How uncomfortable for the girl.

00:46:01.134 --> 00:46:03.928
- Excuse me, Herr General.
- Yes?

00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:07.682
The second one on the left.
Front row. That's Stachel.

00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:16.649
Right.

00:46:18.735 --> 00:46:21.279
"To Leutnant Wilhelm von Klugermann,

00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:27.952
for bravery of the highest order in action
against the enemies of the German empire,

00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:31.581
and for exceptional services to the fatherland

00:46:31.664 --> 00:46:36.336
in that he has destroyed
single-handed 20 enemy aircraft,

00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:41.716
the Order Pour le Mérite, by Imperial decree,

00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:44.761
Wilhelm, Emperor."

00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:57.899
I'm afraid it's rather a small medal, really.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.694
But it's the highest Germany can give.

00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:04.697
Thank you, Uncle.

00:47:29.848 --> 00:47:34.561
Otto, this pilot of yours - Stachel.

00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.314
Humble origin, risen from the ranks,
et cetera, et cetera...

00:47:38.398 --> 00:47:43.361
- Two years' frontline service, huh?
- Yes, that's right.

00:47:43.444 --> 00:47:47.740
To deliver the final blow over your own
airfield, on the doorstep, so to speak...

00:47:47.824 --> 00:47:50.994
- That was splendid, wasn't it?
- Splendid?

00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:54.539
Otto, if this young man lives long enough,

00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:57.834
he could be very useful to our propaganda department.

00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:01.796
The common people of our country
are war-weary, restive.

00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:04.924
They need to be provided with a hero of their own.

00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:07.969
Von Richthofen, Willi, are of our class.

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:12.849
This fellow Stachel is common as dirt.
He's one of them. You understand?

00:48:12.932 --> 00:48:14.809
Yes, I understand.

00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:18.688
But I don't agree with killing helpless men.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.609
Otto, this is 1918. Things have changed.

00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:26.279
Unrestricted submarine warfare,
bombing of civilians, poison gas.

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:30.491
Ask your wife - she's a nurse.
Ask Elfi about the mustard-gas casualties.

00:48:36.748 --> 00:48:39.375
So, you approve of this kind of ruthlessness?

00:48:41.336 --> 00:48:43.630
We fight to win, Otto.

00:48:44.964 --> 00:48:47.050
Yes, of course.

00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:49.260
Excuse me, Herr General.

00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:52.347
Herr General.

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:56.017
May I present Leutnant Stachel?

00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:01.898
I saw the plane which you brought in.

00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:06.361
Very... interesting exploit.

00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:11.282
It proves that our young men
still have vitality, courage,

00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:13.701
and the will to win at all costs.

00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:19.165
Yes, Herr General. Thank you.

00:49:21.042 --> 00:49:23.294
I'm sure we'll hear a lot more of you.

00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:37.850
Kaeti, you haven't met our Leutnant Stachel.

00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:42.897
Stachel, may I introduce the Countess von Klugermann?

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:46.901
My aunt... by marriage.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.656
You appear to have caught my uncle's interest.

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.701
Interest from high places is always welcome.

00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:57.870
May I get you a drink, Countess?

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.875
All right. Champagne.

00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:05.461
Champagne.

00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:07.171
Pink champagne!

00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:11.134
- Pink champagne?
- Yes.

00:50:13.428 --> 00:50:14.929
Yes, Countess.

00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:21.769
May I have two glasses of pink champagne, please?

00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:24.564
May I have two glasses of pink champagne, please?

00:50:48.463 --> 00:50:51.382
That champagne is getting warm, Stachel.

00:50:54.093 --> 00:50:56.095
Not yet.

00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:06.397
Silence, please! Silence, please!

00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.149
Silence!

00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:16.491
Gentlemen...

00:51:17.617 --> 00:51:19.494
in a few hours

00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:27.126
the horizon will be lit up
by the flashes of 7,000 guns - our guns.

00:51:32.465 --> 00:51:36.719
They will herald the greatest offensive in history.

00:51:38.888 --> 00:51:43.476
Our defeat of Russia has released
a million men for the Western Front.

00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.937
I need hardly tell you

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.982
that if we destroy the British and French armies...

00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:54.695
before the Americans can intervene effectively,

00:51:54.779 --> 00:51:57.031
we shall have won the war.

00:51:57.365 --> 00:51:59.992
God be with us! God be with us!

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.488
Oh, Willi, darling.

00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:39.574
Mmm-hmm?

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.826
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:52:47.165 --> 00:52:48.958
I'm sorry.

00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:55.131
Well, I'm not. If you're looking
for your nephew, he's next door.

00:52:56.257 --> 00:52:58.843
Yes. I realize that now.

00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:11.147
As long as you're here,
perhaps I can get you that drink.

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.065
Yes, do.

00:53:13.149 --> 00:53:15.610
I'm afraid I'm out of champagne.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.446
- Then whatever you have.
- Schnapps.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.751
Mmm. Horrible.

00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:33.794
But quite stimulating.

00:53:45.473 --> 00:53:47.934
So that's you - Cobra.

00:53:49.185 --> 00:53:52.313
- Cobra?
- Yes, that's what Willi calls you.

00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:57.401
Has he been talking about me to you?

00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:01.489
I asked.

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.951
He says you're quite deadly...

00:54:05.034 --> 00:54:07.662
in sort of a quiet way.

00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:11.791
He's a romantic.

00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:14.543
- And you're not?
- No.

00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:17.964
No.

00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:21.008
Tonight is a... family affair.

00:54:29.684 --> 00:54:32.103
- Are you shocked?
- No.

00:54:34.397 --> 00:54:38.609
- My husband is a very civilized man.
- Mmm.

00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:41.070
And we are great friends.

00:54:41.362 --> 00:54:43.823
It must be nice to have an understanding friend.

00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:45.992
Oh, yes, it is.

00:54:49.704 --> 00:54:53.082
Willi must be getting impatient.

00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:54.542
Shall I announce you?

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.586
Please do.

00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:07.555
Thank you.

00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:33.576
Fire!

00:58:04.273 --> 00:58:06.025
Fire!

00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:21.290
Come on, lads. This is it!

00:58:40.643 --> 00:58:42.269
Follow me!

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.627
The oil pressure's still too low!

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:58.006
Well, that's all you'll get out of her!
She wasn't made yesterday!

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.969
Oh, is that what it is?

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.857
You'll feel better in a few days, Herr Leutnant.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.652
We've taken Bapaume!

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.445
Bapaume!

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:35.033
That means we're closer to Paris.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.957
- Thank you.
- I'm here to take you back to the squadron.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.292
In there, Herr Leutnant.

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:59.558
- What are we celebrating?
- Your survival, of course.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.852
And your tenth victory.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:05.105
- You're moving up fast, Stachel.
- Too fast?

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.364
Does it hurt?

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.199
Yes.

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:20.579
Then I'd better open the bottle.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:37.220
Tell me, uh... never having suffered it personally...

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:40.474
what does it feel like to be shot down?

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.811
Well, I'd rather you found that out for yourself.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:55.614
<i>Frost.</i>

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:03.080
You know, I was quite pleased at first -
when you were posted missing, I mean.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:04.998
Thank you.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:10.504
Oh, it was just that, uh, all of a sudden,
the war seemed a bit more peaceful.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:14.174
And then - this is the odd thing -
I had a sense of loss.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.968
- I'm touched.
- No, no.

01:08:17.052 --> 01:08:22.933
Seriously. I suppose I've had everything
in my life too easy. I'm inclined to be lazy.

01:08:23.016 --> 01:08:28.939
I have to have a challenge. I need someone
around me who is hard to beat.

01:08:30.315 --> 01:08:32.192
And you fulfill that role.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.904
- How's the countess?
- Countess?

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.989
- Mmm.
- Oh!

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.453
Your aunt by marriage. Is she well?

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.539
I think so.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.041
I should've thought you'd have known.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.837
Oh, yes. She told me about
coming into your room that night.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.506
I knew you'd have to bring it up sooner or later.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.716
The countess.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.429
There's a fascinating subject.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:08.061
I believe you have aspirations
in that direction, Stachel.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.397
You should forget them.

01:09:10.605 --> 01:09:12.399
I'll try.

01:09:13.525 --> 01:09:16.111
But if the impossible happens...

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:19.990
I'll buy you a bottle of champagne.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.159
Will you?

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:25.495
It's vintage 1903.

01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:29.374
You'll find it... hard to get.

01:09:33.253 --> 01:09:34.713
1903?

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.340
I'll remember that.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.395
Thanks for the champagne.

01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:59.237
- That's the fool that almost got me killed.
- I believe he's a friend of mine.

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:01.364
Why don't you take it up with him?

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.201
- I hope it'll be a longer visit next time.
- Yes.

01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:06.036
Stachel.

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:10.040
May I introduce the Baron von Richthofen?

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:17.005
It is an honour, Herr Rittmeister.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.132
And I am very grateful.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.220
1903 again.

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:25.639
You'll never change, Willi.

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:33.063
I'd like to have some of Willi's champagne
with you, but I must get to my squadron.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:37.609
I'm glad to see you haven't had
to pay too high a price for my life.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:41.029
I only lost an old Pfalz, Herr Rittmeister.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.907
Perhaps now I'll get a better plane.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.243
Oh, yes. You will.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.829
My squadron is going to be equipped with

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:53.917
the new monoplane Berlin's been promising.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.628
I don't understand, Herr Rittmeister.

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:01.716
The baron wants you to join his squadron, Stachel.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:04.261
I have no objection.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.430
Well, what do you think?

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:12.727
I'm... very flattered by your offer,
Herr Rittmeister.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:14.729
Thank you.

01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:17.399
But I'd prefer to prove myself here.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.485
Oh, I see.

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:22.404
Well... I admire loyalty.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.124
You are lucky to have this fellow, Otto.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:35.709
Switches on!

01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:43.133
Thank you.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.842
Holbach, bring me that report
from Von Richthofen again.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.844
Yes, Herr General.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:30.347
You're not shoeing a horse.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.349
Get out.

01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:34.559
Herr General.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.617
Stachel.

01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:54.662
I want him brought to Berlin immediately.

01:12:54.746 --> 01:12:56.831
- Yes, Herr General.
- There is some difficulty?

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.668
I don't know what you have in mind, Herr General,

01:13:00.752 --> 01:13:03.797
but with the offensive at its height,

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.550
there'd have to be a legitimate excuse
to order him from the front.

01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:09.135
He's wounded, isn't he?

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.889
- Yes, Herr General.
- Hmm.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.308
A mentionable wound?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:17.977
- In the arm.
- Good.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:20.563
People like soldiers to be shot in the right places.

01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:23.566
Order Stachel to Berlin for treatment.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.443
I want you to ensure that all our newspapers

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:29.781
give full prominence to this gallant episode.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.992
Photographs. Everything.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.494
Yes, Herr General.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.664
Yes.

01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:42.794
I think I can get the field marshal
to see things my way, with luck.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:02.564
What you're telling me behind your jargon
is that this machine is unstable.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.774
Exactly. Herr Field Marshal,

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:08.778
we require at least three more months
to perfect the design.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:10.989
By then, the war may well be lost.

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:22.459
Well, Franz, what more
have you to say to the experts?

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:23.960
With your permission, Herr Field Marshal,

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:27.922
I would like to produce an expert of my own.

01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:30.008
Stachel!

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:39.225
We would like the benefit
of your experience, Stachel.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.562
You'll have read in today's papers
about Von Richthofen.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:46.733
This is the pilot concerned - Leutnant Bruno Stachel.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.405
This way.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.328
The new monoplane.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.708
- Is it as fast as we've heard?
- Faster.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:10.673
What about its manoeuvrability?
Only one wing - will it take the stress?

01:15:10.757 --> 01:15:14.928
It will outturn any Allied plane
at present in the air.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.264
It could even turn the tide of the air war.

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:21.476
Then we must have it.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:24.896
What if I told you that these gentlemen believe

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:29.651
that there will be risks for you pilots
if we hurry it into production now?

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:35.323
Well, we're used to risks, Herr General.
One more wouldn't make any difference.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.203
Leutnant Stachel?

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:48.795
Tell me, do you think that your opinion
would be shared by your comrades?

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.631
I am certain of it, Herr Field Marshal.

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.470
Let me see it again.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.979
Nurse! Nurse, come quickly.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:51.190
Come along, Herr Leutnant.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.863
Frau Heidemann. Leutnant Stachel.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.825
Yes, I remember you. I'm due back in a few minutes.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:03.745
Oh, it won't take long.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:07.332
The jacket, please, Herr Leutnant. And your shirt.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:18.009
Frau Heidemann, those flowers, please.

01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:21.804
Thank you.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.905
Thank you.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.407
Sit down, Herr Leutnant.

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.878
Excuse me, please.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:57.548
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:59.717
Excellent.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.554
I saw how busy you were outside.

01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:05.973
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.976
Now, come along, gentlemen. Along here.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:14.524
Now, Frau Heidemann, if you please,
it is just this one pose.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:19.529
What will you put under the picture?

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.615
"Squadron commander's wife nurses wounded hero?"

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:23.908
Yes.

01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:26.119
Please.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:31.416
Very good.

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:34.877
Now move a little closer.

01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:38.256
Thank you. Now...

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.300
Hold still.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.983
- The play-acting is over?
- Yes, Herr General. We have finished.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:02.572
Elfi, my dear. How good of you
to have found time to come and help us.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:06.492
- It was an order, Herr General, wasn't it?
- Of course.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:09.704
It was a very important piece of play-acting.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.874
I see.

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:29.474
Bruno Stachel. By morning you'll be quite famous.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:31.225
How do you feel about that?

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:35.104
Lucky, Herr General.

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:36.689
Hmm.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:41.527
Tomorrow you will be making
your way back to your squadron.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:47.074
And tonight my wife would like you to dine with her.

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:53.456
That's very kind of her, Herr General.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.918
Not at all. She likes heroes.

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.213
Eight 0' clock.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:20.858
- You don't convince me, Colonel.
- Do you envy the birds?

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:24.403
- It may surprise you to know...
- Is that what makes men want to fly?

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:28.574
...that I am a serious student of military strategy.

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:33.162
- No, Baroness, I am not really surprised.
- Jealousy of the birds? Yes.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.766
Herr Leutnant, about the birds...

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:57.353
Thank you.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.190
Good night.

01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:04.026
Good night. A most successful party.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.613
Pleasant evening.

01:21:15.913 --> 01:21:17.999
Hans.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.131
- What's that?
- It sounds like a drum, Countess.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.153
Good evening.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:53.576
As this is my first opportunity
of speaking to you tonight, I'll repeat it.

01:21:55.161 --> 01:22:00.207
Good evening. And good evening to you,
too, good and faithful family servant.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.003
Good morning.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:07.256
That late? I must have fallen asleep
during your speech.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.342
Hans, some wine for the musician.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.802
White.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.982
Well, I suppose I might as well say it.

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:26.901
Say what?

01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:28.861
You're beautiful.

01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:31.697
- So are you.
- Hmm.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.701
And where is Herr General... your husband?

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:40.539
- Oh, he doesn't worry about me.
- He doesn't?

01:22:41.374 --> 01:22:42.625
Hmm.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:44.835
Well, he should.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:49.173
By now he's with the Countess von Hoehlen.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:52.093
On my right at dinner.

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:56.055
They play war games together.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:06.524
Do these games go on until morning?

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.945
Sometimes.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:20.246
My husband finds them very absorbing.

01:23:21.372 --> 01:23:24.917
It's a very heavy responsibility being a general.

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:27.753
That depends how good you are at tactics...

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.756
Herr Leutnant.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:08.044
- Your wine, Herr Leutnant.
- Hmm.

01:24:14.759 --> 01:24:17.428
Thank you, Herr Leutnant.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.138
It has been a long day.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.728
- Hans.
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:31.192
I want you to go to your mistress and
tell her I think I know what she means.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:34.987
- Now, Herr Leutnant?
- Now.

01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:56.008
Come in.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.847
I knew you would come. Darling, I am...

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.312
Tactics.

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:09.855
Oh, you fool.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:56.253
There's a heap of letters in your room,
Herr Leutnant, from all over Germany.

01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:59.131
Any of them perfumed?

01:26:59.215 --> 01:27:02.384
Yes, Herr Leutnant. There's one from Stuttgart.

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:05.471
- Towards the end she says...
- Yes?

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:07.973
Herr Leutnant.

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.066
Ah!

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:20.236
Hello, Cobra. How was Berlin?

01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:22.363
Hectic.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.199
I brought you a present, Willi.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.160
A souvenir.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.331
Kind of you.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.792
I doubt if our tastes coincide.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.336
Oh, but they do.

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.505
Glasses?

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:12.913
Thank you.

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.053
<i>Frost.</i>

01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:31.307
<i>Frost.</i>

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.607
Excellent.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:45.738
What year is this?

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.281
Uh...

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.368
1903.

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:53.912
We've tolerated you here because we've had to.

01:28:58.334 --> 01:29:01.086
One of these days, Stachel...

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.423
or should I call you Bruno?

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:10.888
One of these days I'm going
to shake you up... considerably.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.600
It will give me pleasure, Willi.

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:17.269
I'll look forward to it.

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:22.608
I wonder if you're as good as you think you are...

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.863
in or out of bed.

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:30.063
Well, Otto?

01:33:33.734 --> 01:33:36.528
Thousands of trucks carrying troops.

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:40.574
I flew over two miles of them.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.955
And it's continuous, like the anti-aircraft fire.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.669
Um... The new replacements. They've just arrived.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:54.296
They're only half-trained.

01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:58.550
I want every man in the air tomorrow,
including replacements.

01:34:10.437 --> 01:34:13.649
To sum up, then, our offensive
has come to a standstill.

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:16.443
A massive enemy counterattack is developing.

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:19.154
The Americans are pouring men into the battle area.

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.032
Our army is hard-pressed.

01:34:22.783 --> 01:34:25.494
We are outnumbered in the air,

01:34:25.577 --> 01:34:30.374
and our observation planes are
shot down before they can report.

01:34:30.457 --> 01:34:33.877
High Command urgently wants information.

01:34:34.753 --> 01:34:40.926
Today I shall lead the squadron on
a decoy mission to divert British patrollers.

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:46.306
Meanwhile, an observation plane will
attempt a photographic reconnaissance

01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:48.809
of the area around Amiens.

01:34:51.103 --> 01:34:54.606
I want two of you to provide close escort.

01:34:59.945 --> 01:35:01.530
Stachel.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:08.704
All right.

01:35:08.787 --> 01:35:12.624
Rendezvous at 0800 hours over sector three.

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:17.045
You'll fly the two triplanes. Take care.

01:35:17.963 --> 01:35:20.716
They are the last ones we are likely to get.

01:35:23.969 --> 01:35:25.011
Questions?

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:31.268
All right, gentlemen.

01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:38.984
Stachel?

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:42.028
Did you meet my wife at the hospital?

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:45.449
Yes, Herr Hauptmann.

01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:47.492
Was she all right?

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:51.163
She is well, Herr Hauptmann.

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:54.875
Thank you. Good luck.

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.816
Where's Willi?

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:20.445
He's dead.

01:43:39.005 --> 01:43:42.634
He was flying too low. He hit the trees.

01:43:47.013 --> 01:43:49.557
- What happened?
- He hit the trees!

01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:54.812
I landed. There wasn't anything I could do.

01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:01.736
He was a better man than you.

01:44:06.658 --> 01:44:08.076
Well, he's dead.

01:44:09.827 --> 01:44:12.080
- Is that your test?
- Yes.

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:13.831
And that was his test too.

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.543
- What do you mean?
- Herr Hauptmann.

01:44:20.171 --> 01:44:24.509
Air Observation report
two British planes down in sector nine.

01:44:25.802 --> 01:44:28.638
Willi didn't die for nothing.

01:44:28.721 --> 01:44:31.266
I'm glad of that, Karl.

01:44:31.349 --> 01:44:33.601
We can tell the family.

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:37.605
They'll be proud of him.

01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:44.279
What makes you think he shot them down?

01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:50.827
You mean they're yours?

01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:56.040
- Why do you think they're not?
- Well, are they?

01:44:56.958 --> 01:45:00.837
Willi killed himself trying to fly me
into the ground and went in instead.

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.257
I'm asking you if those two planes
are yours or Willi's.

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:07.427
All right. They're mine! They belong to me!

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:09.429
Stachel?

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:12.056
I just read your armourer's report.

01:45:13.391 --> 01:45:16.477
Your guns were jammed. You only fired 40 rounds.

01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:21.274
40 rounds?

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.694
Two three-second bursts.

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:28.740
Is your marksmanship that good?

01:45:31.576 --> 01:45:32.744
Yes.

01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:38.458
I'm not confirming these two victories, Stachel.

01:45:39.584 --> 01:45:44.339
But I will report your astonishing
marksmanship to Air Headquarters.

01:47:01.332 --> 01:47:04.502
Firing party, right wheel!

01:47:10.508 --> 01:47:14.846
Firing party, halt!

01:47:16.139 --> 01:47:18.015
Left turn.

01:47:19.851 --> 01:47:21.394
Order arms.

01:47:33.072 --> 01:47:38.035
Otto, the general has asked me to tell you
he's seen the report to headquarters.

01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:41.289
The two victories claimed by Stachel
are to be confirmed.

01:47:43.875 --> 01:47:48.254
The general feels you are inclined
to be prejudiced against this officer.

01:47:54.469 --> 01:47:56.762
Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel

01:47:56.846 --> 01:48:00.725
quia visitavit et fecit redemptionem plebis suae.

01:48:00.850 --> 01:48:03.519
In domo David, pueri sui.

01:48:03.603 --> 01:48:08.941
Sicut locutus est per os sanctorum,
qui a saeculo sunt, prophetarum eius.

01:48:09.859 --> 01:48:14.822
Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine,
et lux perpetua luceat ei.

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:17.909
Requiescat in pace.

01:48:17.992 --> 01:48:20.703
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

01:48:20.786 --> 01:48:23.414
Firing party, load!

01:48:25.625 --> 01:48:27.418
Present.

01:48:27.543 --> 01:48:29.086
Fire.

01:48:29.378 --> 01:48:31.589
Reload.

01:48:32.048 --> 01:48:33.841
Present.

01:48:33.925 --> 01:48:35.384
Fire.

01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:36.969
Reload.

01:48:37.929 --> 01:48:39.430
Present.

01:48:39.514 --> 01:48:40.806
Fire.

01:49:28.104 --> 01:49:32.024
I hope the owner of this place
is as discreet as he looks, darling.

01:49:32.108 --> 01:49:35.027
He should be. I paid him enough.

01:49:39.323 --> 01:49:41.409
What's the matter?

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.744
Nothing.

01:49:43.828 --> 01:49:46.622
It's that bad, is it?

01:49:46.706 --> 01:49:50.793
You'll have to decide
which you prefer - this or women.

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:54.422
Why can't I have both?

01:49:54.505 --> 01:49:56.591
You're soaked through.

01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:02.597
You should take better care of yourself.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.765
Are you interested?

01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:07.643
Yes.

01:50:16.444 --> 01:50:18.613
Don't you believe that?

01:50:18.863 --> 01:50:20.281
Certainly.

01:50:29.457 --> 01:50:32.043
But you were interested in Willi, too.

01:50:40.092 --> 01:50:42.219
Tell me...

01:50:50.728 --> 01:50:54.315
how did you feel today at the funeral?

01:51:15.127 --> 01:51:19.924
You know... he never did accept me as his equal.

01:51:24.095 --> 01:51:26.013
In or out of bed.

01:51:28.974 --> 01:51:32.103
You're deliciously crude, darling.

01:51:34.105 --> 01:51:36.440
You amuse me.

01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:40.611
- I?
- People like you.

01:51:40.695 --> 01:51:43.864
The count. Willi.

01:51:45.991 --> 01:51:48.494
Amuse, or shock?

01:51:48.953 --> 01:51:50.996
I said amuse.

01:51:52.373 --> 01:51:55.042
I adore your innocence.

01:51:55.126 --> 01:51:59.463
You really believe your betters
should behave better, don't you?

01:51:59.547 --> 01:52:02.133
Don't patronise me.

01:52:05.261 --> 01:52:07.847
Not if it offends you.

01:52:17.148 --> 01:52:22.236
Darling? My feelings for you have
nothing to do with the death of Willi.

01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:25.656
You and I are alike, Bruno.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.825
You're good for me.

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:33.038
Willi was a fool.

01:52:34.498 --> 01:52:36.584
He didn't die in battle.

01:52:37.293 --> 01:52:41.130
He died trying to prove
he could fly better than I can.

01:52:41.839 --> 01:52:44.842
- What?
- We played a game.

01:52:45.676 --> 01:52:49.388
In and out of the trees. He lost.

01:52:49.513 --> 01:52:52.600
But I was the bigger fool.

01:52:52.683 --> 01:52:55.686
I claimed two planes he shot down.

01:52:57.646 --> 01:53:00.107
I shouldn't have done that.

01:53:00.191 --> 01:53:04.111
I can get 20 victories without anyone's help.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:11.577
That game, whatever it was,
it was about me, wasn't it?

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:13.746
In a way, yes.

01:53:13.829 --> 01:53:15.873
I find that exciting.

01:53:20.377 --> 01:53:23.088
Would you die for me like Willi did?

01:53:23.172 --> 01:53:25.216
No.

01:53:26.425 --> 01:53:28.093
Are you sure?

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:44.420
It lasted about ten minutes.
They came in low. Sopwiths.

01:54:44.503 --> 01:54:48.132
They hit the fuel dumps.
We are being blasted out of the skies.

01:54:48.215 --> 01:54:50.551
I tell you, the fuel dumps have gone!

01:54:50.634 --> 01:54:53.929
Now, Ziegel, let's get this mess cleared up.

01:54:54.138 --> 01:54:56.932
I want to be airborne again by tomorrow.

01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:01.854
Come on, Ziegel.

01:55:16.368 --> 01:55:20.915
All squadrons have now been ordered
to concentrate on the Marmont sector.

01:55:20.998 --> 01:55:24.168
The enemy have just achieved a major breakthrough.

01:55:24.376 --> 01:55:27.296
12 enemy divisions are moving up on the Marmont road.

01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:30.841
They are our target. There is to be no air combat.

01:55:32.092 --> 01:55:35.429
No air combat. Understood?

01:55:35.846 --> 01:55:37.932
Yes, Herr Hauptmann.

01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:43.604
Our army's in retreat so we must do the same.

01:55:43.687 --> 01:55:44.939
Understood, Herr Hauptmann.

01:55:45.022 --> 01:55:47.274
Stachel!

01:55:47.358 --> 01:55:50.694
Your personal ambitions take second place to the war.

01:58:06.163 --> 01:58:07.873
Hurry up! They're closing in!

02:00:26.303 --> 02:00:28.388
Fire!

02:04:02.352 --> 02:04:04.438
Five... six...

02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:07.816
SEVEN.

02:04:55.447 --> 02:04:57.532
Come on. All of you.

02:05:08.543 --> 02:05:10.587
Otto, are you all right?

02:05:53.296 --> 02:05:55.465
You have cost nearly half the squadron.

02:05:57.092 --> 02:05:59.970
We shot down seven planes.

02:06:00.887 --> 02:06:02.430
Three of them were mine.

02:06:03.682 --> 02:06:06.059
Now you have got 22.

02:06:07.018 --> 02:06:09.980
You and I know that 20 wasn't enough for you.

02:06:12.315 --> 02:06:16.111
The Blue Max is more than
a medal to you. It's a badge.

02:06:18.363 --> 02:06:21.950
Something to show you are as good as Willi.

02:06:24.619 --> 02:06:26.037
Not just Willi.

02:06:32.002 --> 02:06:34.421
I'll see you never wear that medal.

02:06:37.007 --> 02:06:39.634
You disobeyed my orders.

02:06:39.718 --> 02:06:42.846
I'm going to have you court-martialled. Kettering?

02:06:42.929 --> 02:06:44.514
Sir?

02:06:44.598 --> 02:06:47.350
Escort the Leutnant to his quarters.

02:06:47.976 --> 02:06:50.895
Your nerve's gone. You've had enough.

02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:52.814
Stachel!

02:06:52.897 --> 02:06:55.317
Why don't you do what your wife wants?

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.320
- Get a deskjob in Berlin.
- Come on, Stachel.

02:07:24.054 --> 02:07:26.139
Stachel?

02:07:26.222 --> 02:07:28.058
You've been ordered to Berlin.

02:08:03.802 --> 02:08:05.637
Here he is.

02:08:08.765 --> 02:08:10.558
- Goodbye.
- Herr Hauptmann.

02:09:00.608 --> 02:09:03.361
Millions have been slaughtered.

02:09:03.445 --> 02:09:06.740
For what reason? For nothing!

02:09:06.823 --> 02:09:10.410
I say "Down with the Kaiser and his generals."

02:09:10.493 --> 02:09:12.996
The time has come now for revolution!

02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:15.832
Long live the revolution!

02:09:18.293 --> 02:09:20.336
Look out!

02:09:37.729 --> 02:09:40.815
- My dear Otto.
- Herr General.

02:09:41.274 --> 02:09:44.152
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

02:09:44.235 --> 02:09:47.781
- Did you have a good journey?
- Yes, thank you.

02:09:47.864 --> 02:09:50.366
Sit down.

02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:55.955
Otto, tomorrow Leutnant Stachel
is going to receive the Blue Max.

02:10:00.627 --> 02:10:02.796
So you do not accept my report?

02:10:02.879 --> 02:10:07.634
He is young, vigorous, ruthless, a born
leader at a time when we need his kind.

02:10:07.717 --> 02:10:12.222
I believe Stachel should be court-martialed
for the good military reasons I set out.

02:10:12.472 --> 02:10:14.557
Military reasons are sometimes not enough.

02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:17.060
They are for me.

02:10:17.185 --> 02:10:23.358
Otto, you and I have a greater loyalty
than to the book of rules.

02:10:24.818 --> 02:10:26.236
To Germany.

02:10:28.112 --> 02:10:30.365
- We are Germany.
- Exactly.

02:10:32.826 --> 02:10:34.661
Take a look outside.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.585
You see that?

02:10:45.839 --> 02:10:49.008
Revolution is just beneath the surface.

02:10:49.259 --> 02:10:52.679
If that happens, everything
we stand for will be destroyed

02:10:52.762 --> 02:10:58.101
unless the German Officer Corps
stands like a rock, intact,

02:10:58.184 --> 02:11:01.396
and what is more important, untarnished.

02:11:01.479 --> 02:11:06.192
I made this Stachel into a national hero
for good military reasons.

02:11:06.276 --> 02:11:12.448
If I court-martial him now it will reflect
on the integrity of the whole Officer Corps.

02:11:13.867 --> 02:11:16.369
Herr General,

02:11:16.452 --> 02:11:21.708
I see now I have notions of honour...
which are outdated.

02:11:21.791 --> 02:11:23.918
They're not outdated.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:34.095
Stored with care...

02:11:35.388 --> 02:11:37.891
andloveu.

02:11:37.974 --> 02:11:40.059
For better times.

02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:45.189
Here's your report, Otto.

02:11:45.273 --> 02:11:48.067
I ask you to withdraw it.

02:11:50.778 --> 02:11:53.573
- I won't do that.
- I know that.

02:11:56.826 --> 02:12:02.498
If you insist on this course, Herr General,
I must resign my command.

02:12:02.999 --> 02:12:04.918
I do insist.

02:12:15.178 --> 02:12:18.806
In that case, I should like an appointment
with the staff here in Berlin.

02:12:21.601 --> 02:12:23.019
That request is granted.

02:12:28.024 --> 02:12:30.109
Otto.

02:12:30.193 --> 02:12:34.697
I have managed to persuade the crown
prince to make the presentation himself.

02:12:34.781 --> 02:12:39.035
Afterwards, Stachel will test-fly the new monoplane.

02:12:40.286 --> 02:12:42.622
It would be better if you were there.

02:12:44.707 --> 02:12:47.335
I understand, Herr General.

02:13:01.099 --> 02:13:04.143
The keys to Leutnant Stachel's room, please.

02:13:04.435 --> 02:13:06.521
Thank you.

02:13:06.604 --> 02:13:09.065
Excuse me, please.

02:13:09.148 --> 02:13:11.234
Stachel, come on.

02:13:11.859 --> 02:13:13.653
This way, Stachel.

02:13:30.503 --> 02:13:33.464
I trust you will be comfortable.

02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:38.302
A lot more comfortable than I'd expected.

02:13:38.886 --> 02:13:42.515
I thought the press reception went rather well.

02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:45.184
I'll take your word for that.

02:13:46.602 --> 02:13:49.188
The bathroom is through there.

02:13:52.483 --> 02:13:55.945
How do you like your bedroom?

02:13:56.029 --> 02:13:58.614
Oh, if there's anything you want -

02:13:58.698 --> 02:14:02.452
and I mean anything -just call reception.

02:14:03.453 --> 02:14:06.414
- Do you understand?
- I think so.

02:14:07.415 --> 02:14:09.167
Good.

02:14:10.877 --> 02:14:14.172
I'll call in the morning to take you to the airfield.

02:14:16.049 --> 02:14:17.675
Pleasant dreams.

02:14:26.851 --> 02:14:28.936
Reception, please.

02:14:30.897 --> 02:14:34.108
Reception? This is Leutnant Bruno Stachel.

02:14:35.485 --> 02:14:37.695
I don't want anything.

02:14:53.836 --> 02:14:56.714
- Have I come to the right room this time?
- Yes.

02:14:59.258 --> 02:15:01.427
- Countess.
- Herr Leutnant.

02:15:09.185 --> 02:15:12.063
- May I offer my congratulations?
- You may.

02:15:17.485 --> 02:15:19.737
- Can I get you a drink?
- Please.

02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:25.076
I hope you'll be able to be there tomorrow.

02:15:28.037 --> 02:15:29.914
Of course. I want to...

02:15:30.206 --> 02:15:32.208
Mmm.

02:15:32.375 --> 02:15:34.085
No, I want to...

02:15:36.671 --> 02:15:39.423
No, please. I want to talk to you.

02:15:39.882 --> 02:15:42.009
- Talk?
- Please.

02:15:42.802 --> 02:15:44.303
All right.

02:15:46.722 --> 02:15:48.391
Talk.

02:15:51.269 --> 02:15:53.896
I'm going away tomorrow.

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:56.482
Where?

02:15:56.566 --> 02:15:58.526
To Switzerland.

02:15:58.609 --> 02:16:00.653
- Why?
- Germany's finished.

02:16:00.736 --> 02:16:03.739
The war will soon be over and
I don't want to be here when it happens.

02:16:10.913 --> 02:16:13.624
Is the general going with you?

02:16:13.708 --> 02:16:15.084
No.

02:16:16.377 --> 02:16:19.589
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

02:16:20.298 --> 02:16:22.425
I know you get your Blue Max tomorrow

02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:25.845
but we wouldn't leave till after the presentation.

02:16:28.764 --> 02:16:30.933
I see.

02:16:31.392 --> 02:16:34.937
- Go on.
- You will still have your medal, darling.

02:16:37.023 --> 02:16:40.610
As a piece of scrap, it's worth exactly five marks.

02:16:40.693 --> 02:16:45.406
You'll never need to pawn it.
I've got plenty of money in Zurich.

02:16:45.489 --> 02:16:48.659
Don't you understand what this means to me?

02:16:51.162 --> 02:16:54.957
In a few months from now,
you will be ashamed to wear a uniform.

02:16:58.586 --> 02:17:04.008
You're very stubborn, Bruno. But if
you want to see the war out to the end,

02:17:04.091 --> 02:17:07.220
I can get you transferred
to a post near the Swiss frontier.

02:17:07.303 --> 02:17:09.972
Field Marshal von Lenndorf is a friend.

02:17:13.684 --> 02:17:16.395
How dramatic you look.

02:17:16.479 --> 02:17:19.690
You can get me transferred, can you?

02:17:19.774 --> 02:17:23.903
Do you think I came all this way
to run off to Switzerland with you?

02:17:23.986 --> 02:17:27.240
You gambled your life for me once, with Willi.

02:17:27.323 --> 02:17:30.368
That was about flying, Kaeti. Not about you.

02:17:51.597 --> 02:17:54.684
Run off to Switzerland
and become one of your lapdogs.

02:17:58.062 --> 02:18:01.107
There's nothing I want to run away from, Kaeti.

02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:02.817
Not even myself.

02:18:10.366 --> 02:18:12.660
Come on, now. Don't be angry.

02:18:18.666 --> 02:18:22.253
Where's that aristocratic poise I like so much?

02:18:23.170 --> 02:18:25.756
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

02:18:30.803 --> 02:18:34.515
Now, Countess, I'll get you that drink.

02:18:51.574 --> 02:18:53.951
Serve it to someone else!

02:19:51.175 --> 02:19:54.553
The fatherland is grateful, Herr Leutnant.

02:19:54.637 --> 02:19:57.306
Thank you, Your Highness.

02:20:38.514 --> 02:20:40.224
Yes?

02:20:41.976 --> 02:20:44.270
The field marshal said what?

02:20:46.272 --> 02:20:48.858
I can't stop the proceedings now. It's too late.

02:20:50.943 --> 02:20:54.113
All right, but where is the field marshal?

02:20:54.196 --> 02:20:57.366
Ask him to telephone me as soon as he returns.

02:21:02.913 --> 02:21:05.875
Get hold of Stachel. Take him somewhere. Anywhere.

02:21:05.958 --> 02:21:08.919
Just... keep him out of sight.

02:21:09.295 --> 02:21:11.380
And, Holbach...

02:21:14.258 --> 02:21:16.343
send Heidemann to me.

02:21:16.427 --> 02:21:17.511
Yes, Herr General.

02:21:53.088 --> 02:21:57.760
- Herr General?
- Otto, I want you to fly the monoplane.

02:22:00.846 --> 02:22:02.181
And Stachel?

02:22:02.264 --> 02:22:06.602
There has been a little misunderstanding.
It will be cleared up soon.

02:22:08.729 --> 02:22:11.774
Without a court martial, I hope, Herr General.

02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:14.401
Will you take the machine up?

02:22:17.655 --> 02:22:20.199
- That is an order?
- Yes.

02:22:24.203 --> 02:22:26.080
Very well, Herr General.

02:22:51.313 --> 02:22:52.648
Herr Stachel?

02:22:53.983 --> 02:22:55.025
Thank you.

02:22:57.486 --> 02:22:59.530
Someone else is gonna fly it.

02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:06.245
- You said there was a technical hold-up.
- I think there are other difficulties.

02:23:06.495 --> 02:23:08.414
While the general irons them out,

02:23:08.497 --> 02:23:10.791
he thought it best not to disappoint the public.

02:23:10.874 --> 02:23:12.918
What difficulties?

02:23:13.002 --> 02:23:15.337
I'm afraid I don't know.

02:23:15.462 --> 02:23:18.924
- Well, who's gonna fly it?
- Herr Heidemann, I believe.

02:23:39.194 --> 02:23:41.363
Frau Heidemann, how are you?

02:23:43.532 --> 02:23:47.119
What's happening? I thought you were going to fly it.

02:23:47.202 --> 02:23:48.704
So did I.

02:23:51.373 --> 02:23:53.667
I never wanted him to fly again.

02:24:11.101 --> 02:24:13.228
Yes? Ah, yes.

02:24:13.729 --> 02:24:15.564
I will hold on.

02:24:18.025 --> 02:24:19.902
You're late, darling.

02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:23.781
Ah.

02:24:23.864 --> 02:24:25.908
Yes, Herr Field Marshal.

02:24:32.998 --> 02:24:36.877
May I ask how you came by
that information, Herr Field Marshal?

02:25:17.793 --> 02:25:22.965
You told the field marshal that Stachel had
claimed two planes shot down by Willi.

02:25:23.048 --> 02:25:24.258
Why?

02:25:25.592 --> 02:25:27.094
Why?

02:25:28.721 --> 02:25:30.305
Where did you get the information?

02:25:31.014 --> 02:25:33.100
He told me himself.

02:25:34.852 --> 02:25:37.146
He's an upstart. He insulted me.

02:25:39.106 --> 02:25:42.025
So this time you really lost your head.

02:25:45.279 --> 02:25:48.240
The field martial is insisting on a court of enquiry.

02:25:48.323 --> 02:25:50.117
They're going to disgrace him,

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.746
an officer with the highest decoration
Germany can give!

02:25:53.829 --> 02:25:57.666
All because of your stupid little anger!
Do you understand?

02:25:58.333 --> 02:25:59.710
Do you?

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.342
When they do that, they disgrace
the whole German Officer Corps.

02:26:09.219 --> 02:26:10.679
Yes, Otto?

02:26:15.517 --> 02:26:17.770
What is it, Otto?

02:26:17.853 --> 02:26:20.355
Herr General, that machine is a deathtrap.

02:26:21.857 --> 02:26:26.195
The struts are too weak
for the wing loading under stress.

02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.157
I was lucky to get down alive.

02:26:33.035 --> 02:26:34.620
Thank you, Otto.

02:26:47.382 --> 02:26:49.176
Flight Office, please.

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:55.766
Holbach, I want to speak to Stachel.

02:27:04.358 --> 02:27:08.237
Stachel, everything's in order now.
You can take her up.

02:27:09.863 --> 02:27:12.241
And let's see some real flying.

02:27:15.744 --> 02:27:17.162
Sit down!

02:27:22.376 --> 02:27:23.919
Sit down.

02:27:26.129 --> 02:27:27.756
Control yourself.

02:28:23.145 --> 02:28:24.813
Switches on.

02:32:46.992 --> 02:32:48.618
Holbach.

02:32:52.956 --> 02:32:55.083
Give this to the field marshal.

02:32:56.585 --> 02:32:59.588
It is the personal file of a German officer...

02:33:00.338 --> 02:33:01.715
and a hero.

02:33:04.467 --> 02:33:06.261
Yes, Herr General.

02:33:19.482 --> 02:33:21.151
Stand up, Kaeti.

02:33:30.076 --> 02:33:32.120
We'll be late for lunch.
