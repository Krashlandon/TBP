WEBVTT

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.375
Come for me!

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:28.333
You're gaining on it, Johnny.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.333
Am I, father? Am I really?

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.375
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:07.292
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.292
That's the way.
Come on, my son!

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.292
Have you found religion,
Henry?

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:19.333
Will you look down from heaven and
see who's sitting on your throne?

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:22.292
I must know before I die.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:27.333
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.333
Both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore,

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:33.292
and both of us are old,
but there it ends.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:36.292
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:39.333
I've built an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.292
All of Britain,
half of France...

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.292
I'm the greatest power in a thousand
years, and after me comes John.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.250
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.208
Alais, in my time I've known...

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.250
contessas, milkmaids,
courtesans...

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:05.250
and novices,
whores, gypsies, jades...

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:08.208
and little boys,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.250
but nowhere in God's western world
have I found anyone to love but you.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.208
And Rosamund?

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.750
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.250
The new Medusa,
my good wife?

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.250
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.292
No, don't be jealous
of the Gorgon.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:33.250
She is not
among the things I love.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.250
How many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.250
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment.

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:48.250
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.708
We will be holding
Christmas court at chinon.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.167
We have asked the king of France
to join us.

00:05:55.208 --> 00:06:00.208
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.208
Then go fetch the queen
from Salisbury tower.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.167
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.208
She wouldn't miss this
for the world.

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:12.125
Richard.

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.125
Richard!

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:24.125
Hello, Richard.

00:08:35.292 --> 00:08:37.083
Forward!

00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:15.375
Forward!

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:03.542
Geoffrey?

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:06.542
Geoffrey.

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.000
Geoffrey!

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:13.042
Father wants to see me.

00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.042
Your majesty.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:46.042
There's to be
a Christmas court.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:48.125
Yes, madam.

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:51.083
Where?
At chinon.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.250
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:01.917
It's going to be
a jungle of a day.

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:04.250
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:06.292
You'll last.

00:12:06.917 --> 00:12:09.917
You're like the rocks at
stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.

00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:19.333
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:23.333
You have more than you think.
Are you one?

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:26.375
Has my willow
turned to poison oak?

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:29.917
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.375
Not much.

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.667
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.

00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:38.417
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.375
She knows young Henry's dead.

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.417
The young king died in summer, and I haven't
named an heir. She knows I want John...

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:47.958
on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.

00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.875
Henry, I can't be your mistress
if I'm married to your son.

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.875
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:55.625
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:57.750
He's got pimples,
and he smells of compost.

00:12:57.792 --> 00:12:59.875
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:03.417
He could have a bath!

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:06.458
It isn't such a dreadful thing
to be queen of England.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.458
Not all eyes will weep for you.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.167
Will yours?
I don't know.

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.833
Very likely.

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:17.667
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?

00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:21.458
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Your little brother Philip's king of France now,
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:29.833
I only took you for your
dowry. You were seven...

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:34.875
two big knees and two big eyes,
and that's all.

00:13:34.917 --> 00:13:36.875
How was I to know?

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:44.875
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.

00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:09.542
- Geoff!
- Johnny!

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.583
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.792
What difference does
my dowry make?

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:24.625
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:29.667
The vexin is a little county,
but it's vital to me. And I'm not.

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:32.833
It's been my luck to fall
in love with landed women.

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:35.792
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.708
"The richest woman in the
world... she owns the Aquitaine,

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:42.708
the greatest province in the
continent, and beautiful as well."

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:47.708
She was, you know.
And you adored her.

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:52.667
Memory fails. There may
have been an era when I did.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.750
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing
in life has any business being perfect.

00:15:00.708 --> 00:15:04.708
If I say you and I are done,
we're done.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.750
If I say marry John,
it's John.

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:11.708
I'll have you by me,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.708
and I'll use you as I like.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.750
Ah, Christmas...
warm and rosy time.

00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:31.292
The hot wine steams,
the yule log roars,

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:33.750
and we're the fat
that's in the fire.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.750
She'll be here soon,
you know. Who? Mother.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.792
She still want you to be king? We
are not as friendly as we used to be.

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:42.750
If I'm supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.750
What you kiss,
little prince, is up to you.

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:48.750
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:52.750
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I
beg you to believe my reputation.

00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:56.708
I am a constant soldier, a
sometime poet, and I will be king.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.708
Just you remember...
father loves me best.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.708
Why John? John doesn't
care for you at all.

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:06.708
We love each other deeply. None
of them has any love for you.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.667
Because we fight?

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:14.708
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll
tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.708
They may snap at me and plot, and that
makes them the kind of sons I want.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.667
I've snapped and plotted
all my life.

00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:26.708
There's no other way to be a
king, alive and 50 all at once.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.708
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:43.583
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:47.583
It went flat when I told it to.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:50.542
I didn't think to ask for more.

00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:02.583
How dear of you to let me out of
jail. It's only for the holidays.

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:08.542
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:13.542
No,
greet me as you used to.

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.625
Fragile I am not.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:20.542
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:25.542
Oh, but I do have
handsome children.

00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:29.500
John, you're so clean and neat.

00:19:29.542 --> 00:19:32.500
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.

00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:35.708
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes
your eyes go small and piggy...

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.750
and your chin look weak.

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:41.500
Geoffrey.

00:19:41.542 --> 00:19:43.542
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.542
Let's hope he's
grown up like his father...

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.750
Simon pure and Simon simple...
good, good, Louis.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:52.542
If I had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls,

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.792
I'd still be stuck
with being queen of France,

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.500
and we should not have
known each other.

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:00.833
Such, my angels,
is the role of sex in history.

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.542
Thatwill be Philip.

00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:09.833
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:13.542
That's a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee.

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:15.833
My fiancee.
Whosever fiancee.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:18.375
I brought her up, and she
is dear to me and gentle.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.833
He still plans to make John
king. Of course he does.

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:25.500
My, what a greedy little trinity
you are... king, king, king.

00:20:25.542 --> 00:20:28.542
Two of you must learn to live with
disappointment. Ah, but which two?

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:30.875
Let's deny them all
and live forever.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:33.917
Tusk to tusk
through all eternity.

00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:37.542
Ah, my boys.

00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:40.958
The king of France and I will
shortly have a tactile conversation,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.917
like two surgeons
looking for a lump.

00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:46.542
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first
of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.

00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:49.500
I'll make a better one, and so on
through the holidays until I win.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:54.500
For the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.500
- My lord!
- Your grace!

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:51.042
Welcome to chinon.

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:03.417
Ah, that's better.

00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:11.417
I was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17.

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:15.125
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- queen Eleanor.

00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:17.417
All the others here you know.

00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:20.417
I gather you're disturbed
about your sister and her dowry.

00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:23.417
Sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us.

00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:26.417
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.

00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:29.167
Our position comes to this:

00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:32.708
That you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.208
Alais marries Richard, or we'll
have the county back at once.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.458
That's clear, concise
and well presented.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.208
My position...

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.417
well, frankly, Philip,
it's a tangle.

00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:46.458
Two years ago, the queen and I...
for reasons passing understanding...

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.833
gave the Aquitaine to Richard.

00:22:48.875 --> 00:22:51.208
That makes Richard
very powerful.

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.333
How can I give him Alais too?

00:22:53.375 --> 00:22:56.167
The man she marries
has you for an ally.

00:22:56.208 --> 00:23:00.250
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.

00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:03.208
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.375
By what authority? It's got my troops
all over it. That makes it mine.

00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:10.250
Now, hear me, boy.

00:23:10.292 --> 00:23:14.333
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:17.292
Because you put your ass
on purple cushions?

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:21.333
- Sir.
- Philip.

00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:24.375
You haven't got
the feel of this at all, lad.

00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:27.375
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:33.375
I'll mark that down.
This too:

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.333
We are the world in small.

00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:38.375
A nation is a human thing. It
does what we do, for our reasons.

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:41.375
Surely if we're civilized,
we can put away the knives.

00:23:41.417 --> 00:23:45.375
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:49.292
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.

00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:51.333
You came here for a reason. Don't you
want to ask me if I've got an offer?

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:54.333
Have you got an offer? Not
yet, but I'll think of one.

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.333
Oh, by the way,

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:01.333
you're better at this
than I thought you'd be.

00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:04.333
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:12.292
Well, what shall we hang...
the holly or each other?

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:17.333
Would you say, father, that I have
the makings of a king? A splendid king.

00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:19.333
And would you expect me, father,
to give up without a fight?

00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:22.292
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.

00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:25.333
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.

00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:28.333
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown.

00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:30.292
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:34.333
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:38.292
No, your loving son will not.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:41.292
Did you hear what he
called me? Clearly, dear.

00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:45.333
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:48.292
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?

00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:50.250
I'm always saying something
wrong. And don't pout.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.250
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?

00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.250
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:02.250
Has he told you?

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.292
John will rule the country
while I run it, that is to say,

00:25:05.292 --> 00:25:07.250
he gets to spend
the taxes that I raise.

00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:11.250
How nice for you. It's
not as nice as being king.

00:25:11.917 --> 00:25:13.250
We've made you duke of
brittany. Is that so little?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.292
No one ever thinks of crown
and mentions Geoff. Why is that?

00:25:19.292 --> 00:25:21.250
Isn't being chancellor
power enough?

00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:24.292
It's not the power I feel deprived
of. It's the mention I miss.

00:25:24.292 --> 00:25:27.250
There's no affection
for me here.

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:29.250
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?

00:25:35.292 --> 00:25:38.250
Henry?
Hmm?

00:25:38.292 --> 00:25:40.250
I have a confession.
Yeah?

00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:45.250
- I don't much like
our children.

00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:50.208
Only you... the child I raised but
didn't bear. You never cared for me.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.208
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.

00:25:54.208 --> 00:25:57.208
He can people it with sheep
for all I care,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.167
which, on occasion,
he has done.

00:25:59.208 --> 00:26:02.167
Rosamund's been dead
for seven years.

00:26:02.208 --> 00:26:06.000
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:09.208
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.

00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:12.042
He found miss clifford
in the mists of wales...

00:26:12.208 --> 00:26:14.167
and brought her home
for closer observation.

00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:17.667
Liking what he found,
he scrutinized her many years.

00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:21.042
He loved her deeply, and
she, him. And yet, my dear,

00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:25.208
when Henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands...

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:30.125
there is no sport in
hurting me. It's so easy.

00:26:30.167 --> 00:26:33.083
After all the years
of loving care,

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:36.125
do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you?

00:26:36.208 --> 00:26:39.208
Eleanor, with both hands
tied behind you.

00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:47.208
She is lovely, isn't she?

00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:54.167
Yes, very.

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:58.167
Who could I have chosen
to love...

00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:00.125
to gall you more?

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:03.125
There's no one.

00:27:03.167 --> 00:27:05.125
Time hasn't done a thing
but wrinkle you.

00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:08.167
It hasn't even done that. I've
borne six girls, five boys...

00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:10.167
and 31 connubial years of you.

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:14.667
How am I possible? There
are moments when I miss you.

00:27:14.708 --> 00:27:18.167
Many? That's my wooly
sheepdog. Do you doubt it?

00:27:18.208 --> 00:27:21.125
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.

00:27:21.167 --> 00:27:23.667
I've heard it rumored,
but I don't believe it.

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:26.917
Losing Alais will be hard,
for you do love her.

00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:30.167
It's an old man's last
attachment, nothing more.

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:37.125
How hard do you find
living in your castle?

00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:40.667
It was difficult in the
beginning, but that's past.

00:27:40.708 --> 00:27:44.167
I find I've seen
the world enough.

00:27:44.208 --> 00:27:46.167
I'll never let you loose.

00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:49.083
You led too many
civil wars against me.

00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:54.083
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out...

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:57.083
for Christmas courts and
state occasions now and then...

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:02.083
for I do like to see you...

00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:04.083
it's enough.

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.083
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.

00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:12.083
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:18.125
You're still
a marvel of a man.

00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.083
And you're my lady.

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:34.083
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.

00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:37.083
I've fought and bargained
all these years...

00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:42.125
as if the only thing I had to live
for was what happened after I was dead.

00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:44.125
I've something else
to live for now.

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:47.083
I've blundered onto peace.

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:50.000
On Christmas eve.

00:28:50.042 --> 00:28:55.042
Since Louis died, while Philip
grew, I've had no France to fight.

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:58.042
In that lull, I've found how
good it is to write a law...

00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:02.042
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide...

00:29:03.042 --> 00:29:05.042
which peasant gets a cow.

00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:10.042
I tell you, there is nothing
more important in the world.

00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:14.042
Now the french boy's big enough,
and I'm sick of war.

00:29:19.042 --> 00:29:23.000
Do you still need
the vexin, Henry?

00:29:23.042 --> 00:29:26.042
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops
there are one day away from paris.

00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:29.042
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:32.000
Henry, dear,

00:29:32.042 --> 00:29:36.042
if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:39.042
Well, I thought
you'd never say it.

00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:42.083
I can do it.

00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:45.000
You can try.

00:29:45.042 --> 00:29:49.042
We have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for.

00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:52.042
Can you read love in that?

00:29:53.042 --> 00:29:56.042
And permanent affection.

00:30:15.042 --> 00:30:19.042
My Richard is the next king,
not your John.

00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:22.042
I know you, Henry. I know
every twist and bend you've got,

00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:25.042
and I'll be waiting
round each corner for you.

00:30:25.083 --> 00:30:27.583
Do you truly care
who's king?

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.042
I care because
you care so much.

00:30:30.083 --> 00:30:35.083
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you
have me do... give out, give up, give in?

00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:38.042
Give me a little peace.
A little?

00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:43.083
Why so modest? How about eternal
peace? Now, there's a thought.

00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:48.083
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.958
Henry?
Madam?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Did you ever love me?

00:31:09.042 --> 00:31:11.000
No.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Good. That will
make this pleasanter.

00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:30.958
Well, I've come.
I'm here.

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:35.333
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.

00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:38.375
We haven't been alone,
the two of us, in...

00:32:38.417 --> 00:32:41.417
how long is it, lamb...
two years?

00:32:41.958 --> 00:32:43.917
You look fit.
War agrees with you.

00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:47.958
I keep informed. I follow all
your slaughters from a distance.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.833
Do sit down.

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:53.375
Is this an audience, a good-night
hug with kisses or an ambush?

00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:56.625
Let's hope it's a reunion.

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:58.833
Must you look so stern?

00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:01.417
I sent for you to say
I want your love again,

00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:03.833
but I can't say it
to a face like that.

00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:06.875
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?

00:33:07.417 --> 00:33:10.875
Why, for itself. What
other purpose could I have?

00:33:10.917 --> 00:33:14.417
You will tell me
when you're ready to.

00:33:14.458 --> 00:33:17.875
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.

00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:22.500
That's how a queen
in prison spends her time.

00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.875
But there is more to me
than that.

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:28.500
Can't I say I love a son
and be believed?

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:34.500
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.

00:33:34.542 --> 00:33:38.542
I've no dammed up floods of passion for
you. There's no chance I'll overflow.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:42.875
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:47.583
I gave the church up out of
boredom. I can do as much for you.

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:50.792
You'll never give me up,
not while I hold the Aquitaine.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:55.833
You think I'm motivated by love of hills
and dales? I think you want it back.

00:33:56.542 --> 00:33:59.833
You're so deceitful, you can't
ask for water when you're thirsty.

00:33:59.875 --> 00:34:03.833
We could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.750
If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.583
Don't stand there
qulvering in limbo.

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:13.583
Love me, little lamb,
or leave me.

00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:17.250
Leave you, madam?

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.625
With pure joy.

00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:26.625
Departure's a simple act. You put the
left foot down, and then the right.

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:28.625
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:32.667
Father's finished working out
the treaty terms.

00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:36.667
How nice.
Where is your father?

00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:41.792
Ah, there you are.

00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:43.792
Well, have you
put the terms to Philip?

00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:47.833
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him
an audience. I hope you'll all attend.

00:34:49.792 --> 00:34:52.750
Are we to know the terms,
or would you rather tease us?

00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:56.292
Not at all. The terms are... what are
you giving to Philip, what of mine?

00:34:56.292 --> 00:34:59.792
Whatever you've got goes to me. And
what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?

00:34:59.792 --> 00:35:02.792
My God, boys,
you can't all three be king.

00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:05.792
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.

00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:08.750
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.

00:35:08.792 --> 00:35:11.750
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.

00:35:12.792 --> 00:35:14.792
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.

00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:18.750
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?

00:35:18.792 --> 00:35:20.792
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.

00:35:20.792 --> 00:35:22.750
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.

00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:26.792
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.750
You could.
John, I won't be there.

00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:32.792
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.

00:35:32.833 --> 00:35:34.750
You've led me on.
I never meant to.

00:35:34.792 --> 00:35:37.792
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:40.792
Not yet, but I'll do something
terrible, and you'll be sorry then.

00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:45.792
Did you rehearse all this,
or are you improvising?

00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:47.750
Good God, woman,
face the facts.

00:35:47.792 --> 00:35:49.708
Which ones?
We have so many.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.667
Power is the only fact.

00:35:52.708 --> 00:35:55.667
How could I keep him
from the throne?

00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:57.708
He'd only take it
if I didn't give it to him.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.667
No, you'd make me
fight for it.

00:35:59.708 --> 00:36:02.708
I know you. You'd never give me
anything. True, and I haven't.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.708
You get Alais and the kingdom,
but I get the thing I want most:

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.708
If you're king, England
stays intact. I get that.

00:36:09.583 --> 00:36:12.708
It's all yours now... the crown,
the girl, the whole black business.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.708
Isn't that enough?

00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:19.708
I don't know
who's to be congratulated.

00:36:19.708 --> 00:36:23.708
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere
you look, and I'm the only pawn.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:28.708
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.

00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:32.708
- Poor child.
- Poor John.

00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:37.708
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.

00:36:37.708 --> 00:36:39.708
My God, if I went up in flames,
there's not a living soul...

00:36:40.708 --> 00:36:42.708
who'd pee on me
to put the fire out.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.708
Let's strike a flint and see.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.208
You're everything a little
brother dreams of, you know that?

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.667
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.

00:36:54.667 --> 00:36:58.667
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.

00:37:04.667 --> 00:37:08.667
Well, mummy,
if you want me, here I am.

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:15.667
John's lost his chancellor,
has he? And you've gained one.

00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:19.625
It's a bitter thing
your mummy has to say.

00:37:19.667 --> 00:37:23.667
She doesn't trust me. You must
know Henry isn't through with John.

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:27.625
He'll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold.

00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:31.667
And as for Richard's wedding day...
we'll see the second coming first.

00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:34.667
The needlework alone can
last for years.

00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:36.625
I know.

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:38.625
You know I know.

00:37:38.667 --> 00:37:41.625
I know you know I know.

00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:46.667
We know Henry knows,
and Henry knows we know it.

00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:48.583
We're a knowledgeable family.

00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:51.583
Will Richard take me
for his chancellor or won't he?

00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:55.583
Why are you dropping John?

00:37:55.625 --> 00:38:00.625
Because you're going to win. You will,
with me to help you. I haven't yet.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:03.583
I can handle John. He'll
swallow anything I tell him.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:06.625
I'll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:08.583
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.

00:38:08.625 --> 00:38:11.583
You'd sell John out to me,
or me to John, or...

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:16.625
you can tell me... have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody?

00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:18.625
Not yet, mummy,
but I'm working on it.

00:38:19.625 --> 00:38:23.583
I don't care who's king,
but you and Henry do.

00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:26.625
I want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another.

00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:30.583
You have a gift for hating.

00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:33.583
You're the expert.
You should know.

00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:36.583
Dear lord.

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:39.583
You've loved me
all these years.

00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:44.708
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset
the queen. We need you. Help us.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.708
What... and miss the fun
of selling you?

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.542
Be Richard's chancellor.

00:38:52.542 --> 00:38:54.542
Rot.

00:39:00.542 --> 00:39:03.542
Well, that's how
deals are made.

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:07.167
We've got him
if we want him.

00:39:07.167 --> 00:39:09.750
He'll sell us all,
you know,

00:39:10.542 --> 00:39:12.750
but only if he thinks
we think he won't.

00:39:14.542 --> 00:39:18.542
Why did I have to have
such clever children?

00:39:24.542 --> 00:39:27.542
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.

00:39:27.583 --> 00:39:30.542
It's a heavy thing,
your nothing.

00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:33.542
When I write or send for you
or speak or reach,

00:39:33.583 --> 00:39:37.542
your nothings come,
like stones.

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.833
Don't play a scene with me.

00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:43.542
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.

00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:45.542
I had, at one time,
many appetites.

00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:49.542
I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both.

00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:52.875
I even wanted Henry, too,
in those days.

00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:57.542
Now I've only one desire left...
to see you king.

00:39:57.542 --> 00:40:00.583
The only thing you want to see is
father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.

00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:03.583
You don't care who wins, as long
as Henry loses. You'd do anything.

00:40:03.583 --> 00:40:05.542
You are Medea to the teeth,

00:40:05.583 --> 00:40:09.542
only this is one son you won't use
for vengeance against your husband.

00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:13.542
How my captivity has
changed you.

00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:19.542
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Men coveted this talon once.

00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:29.000
Henry was 18 when we met,
and I was queen of France.

00:40:29.042 --> 00:40:32.583
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...

00:40:32.583 --> 00:40:36.542
and a form like mortal sin.

00:40:36.583 --> 00:40:40.042
We shattered the commandments
on the spot.

00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:44.083
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring,

00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:46.792
not far from here,
we married...

00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:49.500
young count Henry
and his countess.

00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:55.500
But in three years' time I was his
queen, and he was king of England.

00:40:55.542 --> 00:41:01.458
Done at 21... five years
your junior, general.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.500
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund...

00:41:06.542 --> 00:41:10.083
no rivals, only me.

00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:14.292
And then young Henry came,
and you...

00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:18.458
and all the other blossoms
in my garden.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.500
Yes. Had I been sterile,
darling, I'd be happier today.

00:41:23.542 --> 00:41:26.125
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.167
I've fought with Henry over who
comes next, whose dawn it is...

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500
and which son gets the sunset,
and we'll never live to see it.

00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:36.167
Look at you.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.500
I loved you more than Henry,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.208
and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.500
I want us back the way we
were. No, that's not it.

00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:50.458
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:55.417
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.

00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:59.208
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.125
I must have it back. It's
mine, and I'll never give it up.

00:42:02.375 --> 00:42:06.167
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?

00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:10.250
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.

00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:14.417
I love you.

00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:17.125
You love nothing.

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:21.125
You're incomplete. The human
parts of you are missing.

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:25.208
You're as dead
as you are deadly.

00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.458
Don't leave me.

00:42:31.208 --> 00:42:33.333
You were lovely once.

00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:35.458
I've seen the pictures.

00:42:36.208 --> 00:42:39.042
Don't you remember
how you loved me?

00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:42.417
We were always hand in hand.

00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:46.833
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?

00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:51.208
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.

00:42:51.375 --> 00:42:53.375
"To Richard... everything."

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:55.375
Mother!

00:42:58.375 --> 00:43:01.208
Remember how I
taught you numbers...

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.250
and the lute and poetry?

00:43:04.292 --> 00:43:07.208
See? You do remember.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.375
I taught you dancing, too,
and languages...

00:43:10.417 --> 00:43:14.375
and all the music I knew and
how to love what's beautiful.

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:20.375
The sun was warmer then,
and we were every day together.

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:53.333
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.

00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:55.333
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.333
Half an hour. Good.

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:08.333
Of course, you know there's not
a word of truth to Henry's terms.

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:11.333
If that's a warning,
thank you.

00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:14.333
What if it's an offer?

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.833
"What if" is
a game for scholars.

00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:20.333
What if angels
sat on pinheads?

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:25.833
What if I were king?

00:44:25.875 --> 00:44:28.333
It's your game, Geoff.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.333
You play it.

00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:48.292
John.

00:44:51.292 --> 00:44:54.250
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.

00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:57.292
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.

00:44:57.333 --> 00:45:01.292
I read three languages.
I've studied law.

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:03.250
What plan?

00:45:03.292 --> 00:45:05.292
We've got to make a
deal with Philip. Why?

00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:09.250
Because you're out, and Richard's
in. And what kind of deal?

00:45:09.292 --> 00:45:14.292
A war. If we three join and fight
now, we can finish Richard off.

00:45:14.333 --> 00:45:17.292
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.

00:45:18.292 --> 00:45:20.292
And mother too?

00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:22.250
And mother too.

00:45:22.292 --> 00:45:25.792
Now, do we do it? Is it
on? I've got to think.

00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:29.292
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.

00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:31.292
You know where
extra princes go?

00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:36.292
Down.

00:45:37.292 --> 00:45:41.292
Well, does John want a war
or doesn't he?

00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:45.292
Do you? If John asks for your
soldiers, will he get them?

00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:48.208
If John wants a war,
he's got one.

00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:51.208
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:55.208
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.

00:45:57.208 --> 00:46:00.208
Do you think we'd win?

00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:04.208
I know it.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:21.208
Henry!

00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:26.583
But you don't understand. I would
appreciate a little qulet confidence.

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:31.250
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.208
Good God,
you don't think I meant it?

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.208
So that whole scene,
all you said to John...

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:41.250
you think I'd ever give him up when I've
mothered him and fathered him and babied him?

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.250
He's all I've got! How often do you
people have to hear it... every supper?

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.250
Should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don't?

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.167
I think you like passing me
from hand to hand.

00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:52.167
What am I to you...
a collection plate?

00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:54.125
Or am I all you've got,
like John?

00:46:54.167 --> 00:46:57.125
I've got to get
the Aquitaine for John.

00:46:57.167 --> 00:47:02.125
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.

00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:04.167
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's
not a province. It's a way to torture me.

00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:08.667
That's why she spent the evening
wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:12.167
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.

00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:16.208
"I taught you prancing, lamb,
and lute and flute..."

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:20.208
That's marvelous.

00:47:21.167 --> 00:47:22.250
It's absolutely me.

00:47:23.167 --> 00:47:26.167
I thought as long as I was
coming down, I'd bring them.

00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:28.208
Whatever are you giving me?

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.250
You're such a child.
You always ask.

00:47:31.167 --> 00:47:33.167
"To Henry."

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:35.125
Heavy.

00:47:35.167 --> 00:47:38.167
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.

00:47:38.208 --> 00:47:40.167
I never could
deny you anything.

00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:44.750
Don't go. It nettles her
to see how much I need you.

00:47:44.792 --> 00:47:49.250
You need me, Henry, like a
tailor needs a tinker's dam.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:53.083
Oh, I know that look.

00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:55.125
He's going to say
he loves me.

00:47:55.167 --> 00:47:57.292
Like my life.

00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:05.083
I talk that way
to keep her spirits up.

00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:09.125
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?

00:48:09.167 --> 00:48:12.083
You think he ought to
give me back the Aquitaine?

00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:15.333
I can't see why he shouldn't. After
all, I've promised him the throne.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:20.333
The boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good.

00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:24.375
There's no sense asking if the air's
good when there's nothing else to breathe.

00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:27.125
Exactly what I told him.

00:48:27.375 --> 00:48:32.125
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?

00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:35.125
No Aquitaine for John.

00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:46.083
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?

00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:50.375
Love, in a world where carpenters
get resurrected, anything is possible.

00:48:50.417 --> 00:48:53.750
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!

00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:57.042
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.

00:48:57.083 --> 00:48:59.375
I recall them all.

00:48:59.417 --> 00:49:02.042
You'd only just found Rosamund.

00:49:02.042 --> 00:49:06.042
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.

00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:09.458
Countless others.

00:49:10.042 --> 00:49:11.458
What's your count?

00:49:12.042 --> 00:49:15.500
Let's have a tally of the
bedspreads you've spread out on.

00:49:18.042 --> 00:49:21.042
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.

00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:27.500
I know.
You still care what I do.

00:49:27.542 --> 00:49:30.542
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.

00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:33.542
Is that menace you're
conveying? Is it to be torture?

00:49:34.083 --> 00:49:38.083
Will you boil me or stretch me...
which? Or am I to be perforated?

00:49:38.083 --> 00:49:40.542
I have the documents,
and you will sign.

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:44.583
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you."

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:50.042
Tears? "Oh, sign before
my heart goes crack."

00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:54.042
I'm like the earth, old man...
there isn't any way around me.

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:56.083
I adore you.

00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:59.625
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.

00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:03.083
I have an offer for you,
my dear.

00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:05.625
A deal? A deal?

00:50:05.667 --> 00:50:10.667
I give the richest province on
the continent to John for what?

00:50:11.083 --> 00:50:14.708
You tell me,
mastermind, for what.

00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:20.042
Your freedom.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.083
Oh.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.083
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,
you're free. I'll let you out.

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:36.042
Think: On the loose in london,
winters in provence,

00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:39.083
impromptu trips to visit Richard
anywhere he's killing people...

00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:44.042
all that for a signature.

00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:49.000
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.

00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:50.958
Yes.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
I even made poor Louis
take me on crusade.

00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:57.750
How's that for blasphemy?

00:50:57.792 --> 00:51:03.000
I dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.

00:51:03.042 --> 00:51:06.000
Louls had a seizure, and I
damn near died of windburn,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.833
but the troops were dazzled.

00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:21.000
Henry, I'm against the wall.

00:51:23.875 --> 00:51:25.875
To be a prisoner...

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.000
to be bricked in...

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
when you've known the world...

00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:38.000
I'll never know how I survived.

00:51:39.917 --> 00:51:44.958
These ten years, Henry,
have been unimaginable.

00:51:47.042 --> 00:51:48.958
And now,

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.958
you offer me
the only thing I want...

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.875
if I give up...

00:51:57.917 --> 00:51:59.958
the only thing I treasure.

00:52:01.917 --> 00:52:04.917
Sign the paper, and we'll
break the happy news.

00:52:04.958 --> 00:52:08.958
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.958
Yes, let's have it done.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.958
I'll sign.

00:52:16.958 --> 00:52:19.917
On one condition.
Name it.

00:52:19.958 --> 00:52:23.917
Have the wedding now.
What's that?

00:52:23.958 --> 00:52:27.917
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:31.958
They've been marching down the aisle
for 16 years, and that's a long walk.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.917
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.

00:52:35.958 --> 00:52:39.958
And you can give the bride
away. I want to watch you do it.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.917
Alais...
I can live without her.

00:52:44.958 --> 00:52:46.917
And I thought you loved her. So I do.

00:52:46.958 --> 00:52:50.917
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.

00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:53.875
What a tragedy you are.

00:52:55.917 --> 00:53:00.875
I wonder...
do you ever wonder...

00:53:01.917 --> 00:53:04.875
if I slept
with your father?

00:53:08.917 --> 00:53:12.417
My father?
It's a lie.

00:53:12.417 --> 00:53:15.875
But there are rumors.

00:53:16.917 --> 00:53:18.875
Don't you ever wonder?

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:21.875
Is it rich, despising
me? Is it rewarding? No.

00:53:22.417 --> 00:53:24.875
Then stop!
How?

00:53:24.917 --> 00:53:26.875
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.

00:53:27.708 --> 00:53:29.875
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.

00:53:29.917 --> 00:53:33.625
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!

00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:37.875
You!
Fetch me a bishop!

00:53:37.917 --> 00:53:40.875
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.

00:53:40.917 --> 00:53:44.917
Ask him to meet us in the
chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!

00:54:17.833 --> 00:54:20.833
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.

00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:25.833
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?

00:54:25.833 --> 00:54:27.833
I never cease to marvel at
the qulckness of your mind.

00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:30.833
You can't hurt me,
you bag of bile.

00:54:30.833 --> 00:54:32.833
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.

00:54:32.833 --> 00:54:36.833
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the
chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.

00:54:36.875 --> 00:54:39.833
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.

00:54:39.833 --> 00:54:42.833
You sound as if you think
it's going to happen. I do.

00:54:42.833 --> 00:54:44.833
He's only plotting. Can't you
tell when Henry's plotting?

00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:47.833
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.

00:54:47.833 --> 00:54:49.750
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.

00:54:49.792 --> 00:54:52.792
You're not my helen. I won't fight
a war to save a face. We're done.

00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:55.792
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!

00:54:58.792 --> 00:55:02.792
Please! Richard, Richard,
we're not...

00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:04.792
honestly, we're not!

00:55:07.792 --> 00:55:10.792
Please!
We love each other.

00:55:13.792 --> 00:55:18.792
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!

00:55:19.792 --> 00:55:23.792
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!

00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:26.792
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!

00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:29.792
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?

00:55:29.833 --> 00:55:32.792
What do you get?
What are you gaining?

00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:35.833
Why, the Aquitaine,
of course.

00:55:35.875 --> 00:55:37.792
What's that again?

00:55:37.833 --> 00:55:40.792
Your mother gets her freedom,
and I get the Aquitaine.

00:55:40.833 --> 00:55:42.792
That is the proposition,
isn't it? You did agree.

00:55:42.833 --> 00:55:45.833
Of course she did. I knew it. It
was all pretense. I believed it all.

00:55:46.542 --> 00:55:49.750
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.708
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:55.792
Marry her, for my sake. It
isn't much to ask. Never!

00:55:55.833 --> 00:55:58.792
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.

00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:01.833
Damn the wedding and to hell with
your position. You don't dare defy me.

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.708
Don't I?

00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:08.750
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:10.875
Make a threat. Come on,
frighten me. Am I? Dunce!

00:56:11.417 --> 00:56:14.708
He never meant
to have the wedding.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:18.750
Come again. You're good at
rage. I like the way you play it.

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.708
Boy, don't ever call a king
a liar to his face.

00:56:21.917 --> 00:56:25.917
I'm not a boy...
to you or anyone!

00:56:25.917 --> 00:56:28.750
Boy, you came here asking
for a wedding or the vexin back.

00:56:28.958 --> 00:56:32.917
By God, you don't get either. It's no
to both. You have a pact with France!

00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:36.750
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.

00:56:36.792 --> 00:56:39.708
Your life and never
are two different times.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:44.708
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:48.667
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.

00:56:48.708 --> 00:56:50.625
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.

00:56:50.667 --> 00:56:53.958
Your bad back? You're getting
old. You'll have me once too often.

00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:57.667
When? I'm 50 now. My God,
boy, I'm the oldest man I know.

00:56:57.708 --> 00:56:59.667
I've got a decade
on the pope.

00:57:02.958 --> 00:57:05.958
What's it to be? The
broadsword when I'm 85?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.667
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.

00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:13.625
I know.
I've seen him there.

00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:16.042
I'll have the crown. You'll
have what daddy gives you.

00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:19.667
I am next in line!
To nothing!

00:57:19.667 --> 00:57:21.667
Then we'll only have the
broadswords now. This minute?

00:57:21.708 --> 00:57:23.667
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?

00:57:23.667 --> 00:57:26.375
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000
men at poitiers. Can they hear you?

00:57:26.417 --> 00:57:29.083
Call and see who answers. You're
as close to poitiers as you'll get.

00:57:29.667 --> 00:57:34.167
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're
all agreed John comes next, I can and will.

00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:38.667
You're a king's son, so I treat you with
respect. You have the freedom of the castle.

00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:41.125
The castle doesn't stand that
holds me. Post your guards.

00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:46.667
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.

00:57:46.917 --> 00:57:50.625
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.

00:58:03.417 --> 00:58:06.167
You played it nicely.
You were good.

00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:11.417
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?

00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:16.208
Oh, God, but I do love
being king.

00:58:16.208 --> 00:58:18.167
Well, Henry,

00:58:18.625 --> 00:58:21.417
liege and lord,

00:58:21.417 --> 00:58:24.167
what happens now?

00:58:24.625 --> 00:58:26.208
I've no idea.

00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:30.625
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll
win, but what the next move is...

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.625
you were scared,
weren't you?

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.625
No.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:45.625
I think you were.

00:58:46.292 --> 00:58:51.208
I was. You mustn't play with
feelings, Henry. Not with mine.

00:58:52.583 --> 00:58:56.250
It wasn't possible
to lose you.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.542
I must hold you dearer
than I thought.

00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:06.542
You've got your enigmatic face
on. What's your mood, I wonder?

00:59:08.292 --> 00:59:10.542
Pure delight.

00:59:10.583 --> 00:59:14.542
I'm locked up
with my sons.

00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:18.333
What mother does not
dream of that?

00:59:25.375 --> 00:59:27.583
One thing.
Yes?

00:59:28.583 --> 00:59:31.375
May I watch you kiss her?

00:59:31.583 --> 00:59:34.500
Can't you ever stop?

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:37.417
I watch you every night.

00:59:37.583 --> 00:59:40.542
I conjure it
before I sleep.

00:59:41.417 --> 00:59:43.542
Leave it there.

00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:47.000
My curiosity
is intellectual.

00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:50.417
I want to see
how accurate I am.

00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:58.458
Forget the dragon
in the doorway. Come.

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:04.458
Believe I love you,
for I do.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.500
Believe I'm yours forever,
for I am.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:14.500
Believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me.

01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:17.583
And believe...

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:24.583
you want more?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:34.583
I'm an old man
in an empty place.

01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:38.583
Be with me.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:34.500
How beautiful you make me.

01:01:37.542 --> 01:01:43.500
What might solomon have sung
had he seen this.

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:47.417
I can't.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.458
I'd turn to salt.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:54.458
I've lost again.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:59.458
I'm done for this time.

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:07.458
Well, there'll be
other Christmases.

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:13.458
I'd hang you from the nipples,
but you'd shock the children.

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:23.958
They kissed sweetly,
didn't they?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.500
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:33.500
Ah, there you are!

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.500
My comfort
and my company.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.500
We're locked in
for another year.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:49.417
Four seasons more.

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.417
What a desolation.

01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:00.417
What a life's work.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.417
Is it too much?

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:12.458
Be sure to squlnt
as you approach.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.458
You may be blinded
by my beauty.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.417
Merry Christmas.

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:21.458
Is that why you're here...
to tell me that?

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.458
I thought
you might be lonely.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.958
Here, chancellor.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.458
Try it on for size.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.417
It's puzzling.

01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:35.417
I remember my third birthday.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:38.458
Not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts,

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.458
but who did what to whom
and how it felt.

01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:44.458
My memory stretches that far back,
but never once can I remember...

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.375
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference.

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:49.375
Why is that?

01:03:51.375 --> 01:03:54.333
I don't know.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:58.417
That was not an easy question from me,
and I don't deserve and easy answer.

01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:05.458
There are times I think we
loved none of our children.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.417
Still too easy,
don't you think?

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:12.375
I'm weary, and you want
a simple answer,

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:14.417
and I haven't one.

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:18.375
I'm so sick
of all of you.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.375
I thought I'd come
and gloat a little.

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:24.375
Mother's tired. Come stick
pins tomorrow morning.

01:04:24.417 --> 01:04:26.375
I'll be
more responsive then.

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:29.500
It's no fun goading anyone
tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:33.542
What's that, dear? We're his
prisoners, if that interests you.

01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:36.375
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:38.542
It was... correct me
if I'm wrong...

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.542
but it was my impression that
you wanted Henry's throne for me.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:45.583
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:48.292
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:50.542
I've suffered more defeats
than you have teeth.

01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:53.292
I know one
when it happens to me.

01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:56.542
Take your wormwood like a good
boy. Swallow it and go to bed.

01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:59.583
I will be king. So you
will, but not this year!

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:03.542
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.292
I can't.
It's not so hard.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:09.583
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.

01:05:11.333 --> 01:05:13.292
And what if John died?

01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:15.625
You wouldn't dare! A
knife. Why wouldn't I?

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:18.333
He's got a knife! Of course he
has a knife. He always has a knife.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:21.583
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:27.292
How clear we make it. Oh, my
piglets, we are the origins of war.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:30.667
Not history's forces, nor the times,
nor justice, nor the lack of it,

01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:33.625
nor causes, nor religions,
nor ideas,

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:36.542
nor kinds of government,
nor any other thing.

01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:39.750
Weare the killers.
Webreed wars.

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:42.667
We carry it,
like syphilis, inside.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:46.333
Dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.292
For the love of God, can't we
love one another just a little?

01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:52.250
That's how peace begins.

01:05:53.292 --> 01:05:56.500
We have so much
to love each other for.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:59.708
We have such possibilities,
my children.

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:01.708
We could change the world.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.708
And while we hugged each other,
what would Philip do?

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:07.750
Oh, good God, Philip!

01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:11.292
We're supposed to start a war. If
father finds out, I'll be rulned.

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.583
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:17.792
Don't do anything without me. Let me
handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:20.292
You advised John into making
war. That fearless boy...

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.250
he's disinherited himself.

01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:25.250
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:28.542
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:31.833
Anything you say. Richard, I want
you out of here before this breaks.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:33.833
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:35.833
Promise anything...
the vexin, brittany.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:39.583
Once you're free and John is out
of favor, we'll make further plans.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:43.292
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.875
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:51.208
And Richard!

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.208
Promise anything.

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.167
I've got the old boy
this time.

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.208
The damn fool thinks he
loves John. He believes it.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.875
That's where the knife
goes in...

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:14.875
knives.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:18.208
Knives.

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:23.917
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,
and I can look at anything.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.208
My, what a lovely girl.

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:32.958
How could her king
have left her?

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:49.167
Philip?

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:52.167
Philip!

01:07:54.417 --> 01:07:56.417
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:08:01.417
The crown can come to me. Are you still
with me? We'll have to fight them all.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:03.417
They'll band together once this
happens. Have I got your word?

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:07.167
Do I have yours? All England's
land in France if I support you?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:11.417
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:14.125
I should say something solemn,
but I haven't the time.

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:17.167
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that...

01:08:17.208 --> 01:08:21.417
you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:25.167
I'll kill you!
Ah!

01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:26.542
Lump.

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:30.417
If you're a prince, there's
hope for every ape in africa.

01:08:30.708 --> 01:08:33.542
I had you saved. I wasn't on
my way to father, but he was.

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:37.167
He would have gone to Henry and
betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:41.167
It's true. I don't know
who my friends are.

01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:47.125
Philip?

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.083
May we? That's what tapestries are for.

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:55.083
I'll never learn.
I'll ruln everything.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:04.583
Richard?
Hello, Richard.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:08.625
You're halfway to bed. I'll
wait for morning. Come in.

01:09:08.625 --> 01:09:11.583
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:21.125
Our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:26.125
It turns to steam, and when it
cools, we call it brandywine.

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:29.667
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.125
No. Then why the charming smile?

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.125
I thought,
I can't think why,

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.125
of when you were
in paris last.

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:39.708
Can it be two whole years
ago? It can. I need an army.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.708
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.083
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?

01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:49.125
They've been two fierce years. I've
studied, and I've trained to be a king.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:53.750
I'll have your answer... yes or
no? You'll have it when I give it.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:55.750
You see?
I've changed.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:59.125
I'm not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago. Remember?

01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:01.792
Racing after boar,
you flying first,

01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:06.125
me scrambling after,
all day into dusk.

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:10.125
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:13.125
Sit and we'll discuss it.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.875
You never write.
To anyone.

01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:28.125
Why should I make you
king of England?

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:31.083
Aren't I better off
with John or Geoffrey?

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:34.125
Why have you to fight when I
could have the cretin or the fiend?

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:37.917
Would we fight? We're
fighting now. Good night.

01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:42.083
You're still a boy.

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.958
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:50.042
You haven't asked how much your
help is worth. You'll tell me.

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:52.042
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:54.792
All of brittany. Does that
matter? That's Geoffrey's.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.917
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what
else? That's all your help is worth.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.917
And in return,
what do you want from me?

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.917
Two thousand soldiers.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.917
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.

01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:06.042
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equlpment.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:10.958
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.042
You got married.

01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:21.042
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.042
I've spent two years
on every street in hell.

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:34.042
That's odd.
I never saw you there.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You haven't said
you loved me.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
When the time comes.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Shh.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It's not too late
at night?

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:50.917
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!

01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:53.958
We couldn't leave negotiations
where they were.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:59.917
Ah!

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:03.958
I keep looking for your
father in you. He's not there.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.958
I'll miss him.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:09.958
Has Richard or the queen
been here to see you?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.917
Does it matter? If they
haven't yet, they will.

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:16.958
I want to reach a settlement. I
left you with too little earlier.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.917
Yes.
Nothing is too little.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.917
I'm sorry
you're not fonder of me, lad.

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:25.958
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men."

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.958
No wonder
he loved everyone.

01:13:28.958 --> 01:13:32.958
I've come to you
to offer peace.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.958
Piss on your peace.

01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:39.958
Your father would have wept.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.958
My father was a weeper.

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.958
Fight me, and you'll lose.

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.875
I can't lose, Henry.

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:52.875
I have time.
Why, just look at you.

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:56.875
Great heavy arms. But each
year they get a little heavier.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:14:00.917
The sand goes pit-pat
in the glass.

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:04.875
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:08.917
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I
say that England is at war with France.

01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:13.875
Then France surrenders. I
don't have to fight to win.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:17.875
Take all you want... this county,
that one. You won't keep it long.

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:21.875
What kind of courage
have you got?

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.875
The tidal kind...

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:29.875
it comes and goes.

01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:33.875
By God, I'd love to turn you
loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?

01:14:33.917 --> 01:14:38.917
You recognize it? They were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left.

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:43.875
Well, things look a little bleak
for Henry, don't they?

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:48.833
You'll say yes to Richard when he
comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:50.833
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.

01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:55.833
And withdraw it all before the battle
ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.833
Why fight Henry when his sons
will do it for you?

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:01.792
Yes, exactly.

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:05.833
- You've got promise, lad. That's
first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:23.792
Good night. Good night? You're
going? We haven't settled anything.

01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:26.833
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:30.833
Oh, but I am. It's been most
satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:35.875
Winning is. I did just
win. Surely you noticed.

01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:40.833
Not a thing. You
haven't won a damn thing.

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:44.833
Hmm.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:48.792
I found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are.

01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.750
I know your plans
and expectations.

01:15:50.792 --> 01:15:52.750
You've burbled every bit
of strategy you've got.

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:55.792
I know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won't.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:57.750
And I've told you
exactly nothing!

01:15:57.792 --> 01:16:01.792
To these aged eyes, boy, that's
what winning looks like! Dormez bien.

01:16:01.833 --> 01:16:03.792
You...

01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:09.792
you made my father nothing.

01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:13.792
You were always better.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.792
You bullied him,

01:16:17.792 --> 01:16:19.750
you bellied with his wife,

01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:22.792
you beat him down
in every war,

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:25.292
you twisted every treaty,

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:27.792
you played mock the monk,

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:31.792
and then you made him
love you for it.

01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:34.750
I was there.

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:37.750
His last words
went to you.

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:40.792
He was a loving man, and you've
learned nothing of it.

01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:45.750
I learned how much fathers
live in sons.

01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:49.708
A king like you has policy
prepared on everything.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:53.708
What's the official line
on sodomy?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.708
How stands the crown
on boys who do with boys?

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:06.708
Richard finds his way
into so many legends.

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:09.708
Let's hear yours
and see how it compares.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.750
He found me first
when I was 15.

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.750
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:16.750
My horse fell,
I was thrown.

01:17:16.792 --> 01:17:19.708
I woke to Richard
touching me.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.708
He asked me
if I loved him.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.708
"Philip, do you love me?"

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.708
And I told him, "yes."

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:35.708
Do you know why
I told him yes?

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:40.750
So that one day I could
tell you all about it.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:45.208
You cannot imagine
what that "yes" cost.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:49.625
Imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore...

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:53.667
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile, saying,

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:55.667
"yes,

01:17:56.708 --> 01:18:00.667
"I love you,

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:03.750
"and I find you...

01:18:03.792 --> 01:18:05.708
beautiful."

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.708
I don't know how I did it.

01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:15.750
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.

01:18:18.667 --> 01:18:20.750
You loved me.

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:29.667
Never.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:41.875
Get out. Please.

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:43.875
I don't want you here.

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:46.792
It's no great pleasure
to be here.

01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:49.792
So the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted, does he?

01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:53.625
I'll go tell your mother. She'll
be pleased. She knows. She sent me.

01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:56.583
How completely hers you are.

01:18:56.625 --> 01:18:59.833
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:01.833
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:05.875
Not that monument to muck,
that epic idiot.

01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:08.750
Why him? Why always him and never me?

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.625
He was the eldest.
He came first.

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:16.625
Christ, Henry,
is that all?

01:19:16.667 --> 01:19:18.917
You went with Eleanor.

01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:22.958
You never called me.
You never said my name.

01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:28.625
I'd have walked. I'd have
crawled. I'd have done anything.

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:33.958
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.

01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:37.625
I only wanted you.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.042
No, my crown. You want my
kingdom. You keep your kingdom.

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:44.000
That I will.
I hope it kills you.

01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:50.000
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:54.042
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:00.625
"Much"? I don't think
of you at all.

01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:03.583
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:07.083
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.

01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:10.583
I haven't Richard's military skill,
but he was here betraying you, not I.

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:16.625
I haven't John's... God knows what you
see in John... and he's betrayed you too.

01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:18.625
You think I'd ever
make you king?

01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:21.625
You'll make me king
because I'm all you've got.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:25.625
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.

01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:27.625
For moving John
to treason.

01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:32.208
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried,

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.167
and I don't doubt
John loves me.

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.625
Like a glutton
loves his lunch.

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:43.625
You turd.

01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:54.208
Well, John?

01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:59.167
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:03.250
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't
plot against you, ever.

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:06.208
I know.
You're a good boy.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:10.125
Can I go now, please? It's
late. I ought to be in bed.

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:22.292
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't
you trust me? It was all yours.

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.583
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?

01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:27.583
Who do you think I built
this kingdom for? Me!

01:21:28.292 --> 01:21:30.292
Daddy did it all for me.

01:21:30.292 --> 01:21:33.583
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?

01:21:33.667 --> 01:21:38.333
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:41.333
And you don't love anything.

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:48.375
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:52.333
Here, father.
Here I am.

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:18.500
My life, when it is written,
will read better than it lived.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.458
Henry fitz-empress, first
plantagenet, a king at 21,

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
the ablest soldier
of an able time.

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:29.500
He led men well, he cared
for justice when he could...

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.458
and ruled, for 30 years, a state
as great as charlemagne's.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:39.458
He married out of love
a woman out of legend.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:43.500
Not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen.

01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:49.458
She bore him many children,

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.417
but no sons.

01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:54.458
King Henry had no sons.

01:22:56.458 --> 01:23:01.458
He had three whiskered things,
but he disowned them.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.458
You're not mine!
We're not connected!

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.417
I deny you!

01:23:09.458 --> 01:23:11.417
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!

01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:16.458
And I wish you plague! May all
your children breech and die!

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:25.458
My boys are gone.

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.458
I've lost my boys.

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:54.917
You dare to damn me,
do you?

01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:57.417
Well, I'll damn you back.

01:23:57.417 --> 01:24:00.375
Goddamn you!

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.375
My boys are gone.

01:24:10.417 --> 01:24:12.375
I've lost my boys.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:19.375
Oh, jesus.

01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:23.375
All my boys.

01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:38.333
Henry?

01:27:32.417 --> 01:27:38.250
<i>The Christmas wine
is in the pot</i>

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:44.417
<i>The Christmas coals
are red</i>

01:27:45.417 --> 01:27:49.917
<i>I'll spend my day
the lover's way</i>

01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:54.417
<i>Unwrapping all my gifts</i>

01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:57.417
<i>In bed</i>

01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:02.458
<i>The Christmas mass</i>

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.458
<i>Is over now</i>

01:28:05.458 --> 01:28:11.167
<i>The Christmas prayers
are done</i>

01:28:14.167 --> 01:28:18.167
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.

01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:22.500
When I was little, Christmas was
a time of great confusion to me.

01:28:22.542 --> 01:28:26.167
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:29.500
I never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating.

01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:32.542
Henry isn't here. Good, we
can talk behind his back.

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:35.167
What happened?
Don't you know?

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:39.167
There was a scene with beds and
tapestries, and many things got said.

01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:41.542
Spiced wine.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:45.500
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?

01:28:45.542 --> 01:28:49.125
It's your room just as much as
mine. We're both in residence.

01:28:49.167 --> 01:28:51.542
Packed in like the poor,
three to a bed.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:55.083
Did you love Henry...
ever?

01:28:55.125 --> 01:28:59.542
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.

01:28:59.583 --> 01:29:04.125
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There
are no written records or survivors.

01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:07.583
There are pictures. She was
prettier than you. Oh, much.

01:29:07.625 --> 01:29:11.625
Her eyes, in certain light, were
violet, and all her teeth were even.

01:29:11.667 --> 01:29:13.583
That's a rare, fair feature...
even teeth.

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:18.125
She smiled to excess, but she
chewed with real distinction.

01:29:18.167 --> 01:29:20.125
And you hate her
even now.

01:29:20.167 --> 01:29:22.625
No, but I did.

01:29:22.667 --> 01:29:27.875
He put her in my place, you see,
and that was very hard.

01:29:27.917 --> 01:29:33.125
Like you, she headed Henry's
table. That's my chair.

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:37.208
And so
you had her poisoned.

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:39.708
No, I never poisoned rosamund.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.708
Oh, I prayed for her to drop...

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:45.750
and smiled a little
when she did.

01:29:45.792 --> 01:29:48.083
Why aren't you happy?

01:29:48.125 --> 01:29:52.750
Henry's keeping you. You
must be cleverer than I am.

01:29:52.792 --> 01:29:54.750
I've tried feeling pity
for you,

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.125
but it keeps on turning
into something else.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.750
Why pity?

01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:04.125
You love Henry, but you
love his kingdom too.

01:30:04.167 --> 01:30:06.833
You look at him,
and you see cities,

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:10.833
acreage, coastline,
taxes.

01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:13.125
All I see is Henry.

01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:17.125
Leave him to me,
can't you?

01:30:18.875 --> 01:30:21.125
I left him years ago.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:25.125
And I thought
I could move you.

01:30:25.167 --> 01:30:27.875
Were you always
like this?

01:30:27.917 --> 01:30:30.875
When I was young and worshipped
you, is this what you were like?

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:33.875
Most likely.

01:30:33.917 --> 01:30:38.917
Child, I'm finished, and I've come
to give him anything he asks for.

01:30:40.958 --> 01:30:44.958
Do you know what I
should like for Christmas?

01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:47.083
I should like
to see you suffer.

01:30:50.083 --> 01:30:53.917
Alais, just for you.

01:30:58.083 --> 01:31:02.083
Alors, ma petite.

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:06.958
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
The sky is pocked with stars.

01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:33.042
What eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many.

01:31:33.083 --> 01:31:36.083
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.

01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:39.042
I wonder...
were there fewer stars then?

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:43.083
I don't know. I fancy
there's a mystery in it.

01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:46.000
What's this?
Warm wine.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Why, so it is.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
You are as beautiful
as I remembered.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
She came to find out what
your plans are. I know.

01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:05.000
She wants you back.
Go to your room.

01:32:11.042 --> 01:32:14.000
So, you want me back.

01:32:16.042 --> 01:32:18.000
She thinks I do.

01:32:18.042 --> 01:32:21.042
She thinks the need
for loving never stops.

01:32:21.042 --> 01:32:23.000
She has a point.

01:32:24.042 --> 01:32:26.000
I marvel at you.
After all these years,

01:32:26.042 --> 01:32:29.042
still like a democratic drawbridge,
going down for everybody.

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:33.000
At my age, there's not
much traffic anymore.

01:32:35.042 --> 01:32:37.000
To your interminable health.

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:45.042
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:48.208
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.

01:32:48.958 --> 01:32:50.917
We always do.

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:54.208
It's his impression that
you mean to disinherit them.

01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:56.167
I fancy I'll relent.

01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:59.208
Don't you?
I don't much care.

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:01.958
In fact, I wonder, Henry,
if I care for anything.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.958
I wonder if I'm hungry
out of habit.

01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:07.750
I could listen to you lie
for hours.

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:11.250
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:15.250
Henry, I'm so tired.

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:18.958
Sleep then. Sleep and
dream of me withcroutons.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.917
Henri a la mode.

01:33:20.958 --> 01:33:24.250
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.

01:33:24.292 --> 01:33:27.333
What do you want? You want my
name on paper? I'll sign anything.

01:33:27.375 --> 01:33:29.292
You want the Aquitaine
for John? It's John's.

01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:33.333
It's his, it's yours, it's
anybody's. In exchange for what?

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:35.375
For nothing.
For a little qulet.

01:33:35.417 --> 01:33:37.375
For an end to this,
for God's sake.

01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:39.375
Sail me back to England,
lock me up...

01:33:39.958 --> 01:33:42.375
and lose the key
and let me be alone.

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.875
You have my oath.

01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:55.917
I give my word.
Oh, well.

01:33:57.625 --> 01:33:59.917
Well, well.

01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:06.917
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?

01:34:07.125 --> 01:34:11.917
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a
curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!

01:34:11.958 --> 01:34:15.417
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:19.417
How,

01:34:19.917 --> 01:34:21.917
from where we started,

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:26.917
did we ever reach
this Christmas?

01:34:29.917 --> 01:34:31.917
Step by step.

01:34:34.917 --> 01:34:36.875
What happens to me now?

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:40.917
That's lively curiosity
from such a dead cat.

01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:44.875
If you want to know
my plans, just ask me.

01:34:44.917 --> 01:34:47.458
Conquer china, sack the
vatican, or take the veil.

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:50.833
I'm not among the ones
who give a damn.

01:34:50.833 --> 01:34:55.500
Just let me sign my lands
to John and go to bed.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.833
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.

01:34:57.833 --> 01:35:01.833
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

01:35:01.875 --> 01:35:04.500
Let's have it done.
Let's not.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:08.542
No, I don't think I want
your signature on anything.

01:35:10.833 --> 01:35:13.542
You don't?
Dear God,

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:17.542
the pleasure I still get
from goading you.

01:35:17.583 --> 01:35:21.708
You don't want John to have
my provinces? Bull's-eye.

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:25.833
I can't bear you when
you're smug. I know, I know.

01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:30.625
You don't want Richard, and you
don't want John. You've grasped it.

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:33.833
All right, then,
shatter me!

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:38.667
Let me have it.
What do you want?

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.833
A new wife.

01:35:50.792 --> 01:35:52.792
Oh.

01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:58.750
So,

01:35:58.792 --> 01:36:01.792
I'm to be annulled.

01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:09.667
Well,
will the pope annul me,

01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:11.667
do you think?

01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:15.583
The pontiff owes me one
pontificate. I think he will.

01:36:16.792 --> 01:36:19.250
Out Eleanor,

01:36:19.292 --> 01:36:21.708
in alais.

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:29.792
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:34.792
That is the single thing...

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:39.792
of which I would have thought
you had enough.

01:36:39.833 --> 01:36:42.750
I want a son.
We could populate...

01:36:42.792 --> 01:36:47.750
a country town with country
girls who've borne you sons.

01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:50.750
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.

01:36:50.792 --> 01:36:52.708
All my sons are bastards.

01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:04.750
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.

01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:07.708
Your sons are part of you.

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:10.750
Like warts and goiters,
and I'm having them removed.

01:37:10.792 --> 01:37:13.750
We've made them.
They're our boys.

01:37:13.792 --> 01:37:16.250
I know, and good God,
look at them.

01:37:16.292 --> 01:37:18.708
Geoffrey...
there's a masterpiece.

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:22.750
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.

01:37:23.292 --> 01:37:26.708
And johnny...

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:29.750
was his latest treason
your idea?

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:35.708
I caught him lying,
and I've said, "he's young."

01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:38.708
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy."

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:43.750
I've watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants, and he's not a child.

01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:46.750
He's the man we made him.

01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:49.667
Don't share John with me.

01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:53.667
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.

01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:58.667
How could you send him off
to deal with Philip?

01:38:00.667 --> 01:38:02.667
I was tired.

01:38:02.708 --> 01:38:04.667
I was busy.

01:38:05.667 --> 01:38:07.667
They were friends.

01:38:07.667 --> 01:38:10.667
Eleanor, he was the best.

01:38:12.667 --> 01:38:16.667
From the cradle on, you cradled
him. I never had a chance.

01:38:16.708 --> 01:38:19.667
You never wanted one. How
do you know? You took him.

01:38:20.667 --> 01:38:23.708
Separation from your husband
you could bear, but not your son.

01:38:23.708 --> 01:38:26.708
Whatever I have done,
you made me do.

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:29.208
You threw me out of bed
for Richard.

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.667
Not until you threw me out
for rosamund.

01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:37.708
It's not that simple. I won't
have it to be that simple.

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:41.708
I adored you.
Never.

01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:44.667
I still do.

01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:47.625
Of all the lies,
that one is the most terrible.

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:52.625
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.

01:39:04.625 --> 01:39:09.625
Oh, Henry, we've mangled
everything we've touched.

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:14.625
Deny us what you will,
we have done that.

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:21.583
Do you remember when we met?

01:39:21.625 --> 01:39:25.625
Down to the hour
and color of your stockings.

01:39:30.625 --> 01:39:34.625
I could hardly see you
for the sunlight.

01:39:34.667 --> 01:39:37.625
It was raining,
but no matter.

01:39:41.625 --> 01:39:45.625
There was very little talk,
as I recall.

01:39:45.667 --> 01:39:47.583
Very little.

01:39:47.625 --> 01:39:51.125
I had never seen
such beauty.

01:39:51.167 --> 01:39:54.625
I walked right up
and touched it.

01:39:56.625 --> 01:39:59.625
God, where did I find
the gall to do that?

01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:02.625
In my eyes.

01:40:03.625 --> 01:40:05.625
I loved you.

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:21.625
No annulment.

01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:25.625
What? There will be no annulment.

01:40:25.708 --> 01:40:29.625
Will there not? No, I'm afraid
you'll have to do without.

01:40:29.667 --> 01:40:32.708
Well, it was
just a whim.

01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:36.750
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.

01:40:38.792 --> 01:40:43.750
Out of curiosity, as
intellectual to intellectual,

01:40:44.667 --> 01:40:47.583
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me?

01:40:49.583 --> 01:40:50.750
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?

01:40:51.583 --> 01:40:53.750
Ever with you? Am I ever
anywhere but somewhere else?

01:40:54.583 --> 01:40:56.542
Do I write?
Do we send messages?

01:40:56.583 --> 01:41:00.583
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you? Are you remembered?

01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:02.542
You are.

01:41:02.583 --> 01:41:06.583
You're no part of me. We
do not touch at any point.

01:41:06.625 --> 01:41:10.083
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?

01:41:10.125 --> 01:41:13.583
You know me well enough
to know I can't be stopped.

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:17.542
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.

01:41:17.583 --> 01:41:22.833
Every enemy you have has friends
in rome. We'll cost you time.

01:41:22.875 --> 01:41:26.542
What is this?
I'm not moldering.

01:41:26.583 --> 01:41:30.875
My paint's not peeling. I'm
good for years. How many years?

01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:35.875
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.

01:41:35.917 --> 01:41:40.583
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.

01:41:40.625 --> 01:41:43.917
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.

01:41:43.958 --> 01:41:47.250
That, too,
is possible.

01:41:47.292 --> 01:41:50.417
How old is daddy then?

01:41:50.417 --> 01:41:53.500
What kind of spindly,

01:41:53.542 --> 01:41:57.500
rickett-ridden, milky,
wizened, dim-eyed,

01:41:57.542 --> 01:42:03.542
gammy-handed, limpy line
of things will you beget?

01:42:03.542 --> 01:42:05.500
It's sweet of you to care.

01:42:05.542 --> 01:42:10.542
And when you die, which is
regrettable but necessary,

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:15.500
what will happen to frail alais
and her pruney prince?

01:42:15.542 --> 01:42:20.500
You can't think Richard's going
to wait for your grotesque to grow.

01:42:21.542 --> 01:42:24.500
You wouldn't let him
do a thing like that?

01:42:24.542 --> 01:42:28.500
Let him? I'd push him
through the nursery door.

01:42:29.542 --> 01:42:32.500
You're not that cruel.

01:42:32.542 --> 01:42:36.542
Don't fret. We'll wait
until you're dead to do it.

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:40.500
Eleanor, what do you want?

01:42:40.542 --> 01:42:42.500
Just what you want...
a king for a son.

01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:46.417
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?

01:42:46.458 --> 01:42:51.458
One son is all I've got, and you
can blot him out and call me cruel?

01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:55.458
For these ten years, you've
lived with everything I've lost...

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:59.458
and loved another woman
through it all, and I am cruel?

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.458
I could peel you like a pear,

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:05.542
and God himself
would call it justice.

01:43:08.458 --> 01:43:10.542
I will die sometime soon.

01:43:11.542 --> 01:43:14.417
One day I'll duck too slow,
and at westminster,

01:43:14.458 --> 01:43:16.583
they'll sing out "long live
the king" for someone else.

01:43:16.625 --> 01:43:19.458
I beg you, let it be
a son of mine.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:24.458
I am not moved to tears.

01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:29.458
I have no sons. You have too
many sons. You don't need more.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.458
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.

01:43:36.458 --> 01:43:39.458
To rome? That's where
they keep the pope.

01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:42.458
You don't dare go!

01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:45.375
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.

01:43:45.417 --> 01:43:49.417
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!

01:43:49.458 --> 01:43:51.375
You go to rome,
we'll rise against you!

01:43:51.417 --> 01:43:53.625
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

01:43:54.417 --> 01:43:57.625
The day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings!

01:43:58.417 --> 01:44:01.417
There'll be pork in the treetops
come morning!

01:44:02.667 --> 01:44:05.667
Don't you see you've given them
a common cause: New sons?

01:44:06.417 --> 01:44:08.417
You leave the country,
and you've lost it.

01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:15.417
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:18.708
Yes, he would.

01:44:20.417 --> 01:44:24.417
Now how's your trip
to rome?

01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:29.375
Oh, I've got you,
got you, got you.

01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:33.417
Should I take a thousand
men-at-arms, or is that showy?

01:44:33.458 --> 01:44:35.750
Bluff away.

01:44:35.792 --> 01:44:40.417
Ah, poor thing. How can I break
the news? You've just miscalculated.

01:44:40.792 --> 01:44:42.792
Have I? How?

01:44:43.417 --> 01:44:47.583
You should have lied. You should have
promised to be good while I was gone.

01:44:47.625 --> 01:44:51.750
I would have let your three boys
loose. They could have fought me then.

01:44:51.792 --> 01:44:53.792
You wouldn't keep your sons
locked up here.

01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:55.750
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.

01:44:55.792 --> 01:44:58.792
Why not? Let them sit in
chinon for a while. I forbid it.

01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:03.333
She forbids it. Did your father
sleep with me, or didn't he?

01:45:05.375 --> 01:45:09.583
No doubt you're going to tell me
that he did. Would it upset you?

01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:13.792
What about the thousand men? I
say be gaudy and to hell with it.

01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:17.875
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock
bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.

01:45:17.917 --> 01:45:21.333
I think you think you
mean it. Ask for something.

01:45:21.375 --> 01:45:24.875
Eleanor, we're passed it, years
passed. Test me. Name an act.

01:45:25.375 --> 01:45:28.875
There isn't one! About my
fornication with your father.

01:45:28.917 --> 01:45:31.875
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,
old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:37.917
You're so afraid of dying. You're
so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.

01:45:38.375 --> 01:45:43.917
If only she'd lied. She did. She
said she never loved your father.

01:45:43.958 --> 01:45:45.875
I can always count on you.

01:45:45.917 --> 01:45:48.875
I never touched you without
thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey."

01:45:49.292 --> 01:45:52.250
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.

01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:55.250
I've put more horns on you
than Louis ever wore.

01:45:55.292 --> 01:45:57.917
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.

01:45:58.292 --> 01:46:03.917
You can try. I loved your
father's body. He was beautiful.

01:46:03.917 --> 01:46:07.958
It never happened. I can see his
body now. Shall I describe it?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.958
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough,

01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:11.917
with scars here.
No!

01:46:11.958 --> 01:46:15.000
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!

01:46:17.292 --> 01:46:21.250
I feel it!

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:24.000
What?
Have I hurt you?

01:46:25.292 --> 01:46:27.250
Let me finish!

01:46:27.292 --> 01:46:30.292
You were in the next room
when he did it!

01:46:48.042 --> 01:46:50.000
Well,

01:46:50.042 --> 01:46:54.250
what family doesn't have
its ups and downs?

01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:01.083
I'm cold.

01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:05.125
I can't feel anything.

01:47:06.250 --> 01:47:08.250
Not anything at all.

01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:16.167
We couldn't go back,
could we, Henry?

01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:24.167
William!

01:47:28.625 --> 01:47:32.625
Up! Up!

01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:44.250
When the king is off his ass,
nobody sleeps!

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.125
Up! Up!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.125
Up! Up!

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:10.125
Tell her to pack. She
leaves when it's light.

01:50:30.167 --> 01:50:32.125
Up, up!

01:52:32.042 --> 01:52:35.000
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.

01:52:35.042 --> 01:52:39.042
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?

01:52:39.083 --> 01:52:41.042
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?

01:52:41.167 --> 01:52:44.958
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.958
We're off to rome
to see the pope.

01:52:47.958 --> 01:52:48.958
He's excommunicated you again.

01:52:49.958 --> 01:52:53.958
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.

01:52:53.958 --> 01:52:56.958
The nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn't consummated.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.958
Oh, be serious.
I am.

01:52:58.958 --> 01:53:01.958
It seems that you and I
are getting married.

01:53:03.958 --> 01:53:05.958
By the pope himself.

01:53:09.958 --> 01:53:12.458
You mean it?

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.958
Shall I kneel?

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.958
It's not another trick? The bridal
party's drilling on the cobblestones.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.958
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.917
We're launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change.

01:53:44.958 --> 01:53:46.917
She'll be barging down
the river by lunchtime.

01:53:46.958 --> 01:53:48.875
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.

01:53:48.917 --> 01:53:52.917
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

01:53:52.958 --> 01:53:56.917
The royal boys are aging with the
royal port. You haven't said yes.

01:53:56.958 --> 01:53:58.875
Would you like
a formal declaration?

01:53:58.917 --> 01:54:02.917
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.

01:54:03.958 --> 01:54:07.917
Sad alais,
will you marry me?

01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.875
Be my queen.

01:54:11.917 --> 01:54:14.000
We'll love each other,
and you'll give me sons.

01:54:14.917 --> 01:54:17.458
Let's have six. We'll
do Eleanor one better.

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.958
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.917
Louls le premier. How's
that for a king of England?

01:54:32.042 --> 01:54:34.917
Henry, you can't ever
let them out.

01:54:35.917 --> 01:54:39.875
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.

01:54:39.917 --> 01:54:45.000
You've put them in the dungeon, and
you've got to keep them there forever.

01:54:46.042 --> 01:54:48.958
Do I now? If they're free when you die,

01:54:48.958 --> 01:54:51.875
it's the dungeon
or the nunnery for me.

01:54:52.875 --> 01:54:55.042
But, Henry,
what about the child?

01:54:55.875 --> 01:54:57.875
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.

01:54:57.917 --> 01:54:59.833
If they're free,
they'll kill it.

01:54:59.875 --> 01:55:05.083
And I will not live to see
our children murdered.

01:55:09.875 --> 01:55:11.875
Henry!

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:17.125
Are you going down?

01:55:20.875 --> 01:55:24.875
To let them out
or to keep them in?

01:55:30.167 --> 01:55:34.167
Could you say
to a child of yours,

01:55:34.208 --> 01:55:37.875
"you've seen the sunlight
for the last time"?

01:55:40.208 --> 01:55:43.875
Can you do it, Henry?

01:55:44.792 --> 01:55:48.167
I shall have to,

01:55:48.208 --> 01:55:50.167
shan't I?

01:58:38.708 --> 01:58:40.708
He's here.

01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:47.167
He'll get no satisfaction out of
me. He isn't going to see me beg.

01:58:47.208 --> 01:58:51.625
Why, you chivalric fool, as if
the way one fell down mattered.

01:58:51.667 --> 01:58:54.625
When the fall is all there is,
it matters.

01:59:14.625 --> 01:59:16.625
My barge is sailing
with the tide.

01:59:16.625 --> 01:59:18.625
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?

01:59:19.625 --> 01:59:21.625
I've brought you each a little
something. What's he planning?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.625
Is he going to keep us here? For God's
sake, mother. I picked it out especially.

01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:33.625
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.

01:59:33.667 --> 01:59:36.667
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.

01:59:36.667 --> 01:59:38.625
You can walk right out. We'll go
to poitiers. He'll expect that.

01:59:38.667 --> 01:59:41.167
But we'll meet him with an army
when he comes. You stick close to me.

01:59:41.208 --> 01:59:43.667
When you run, run hard. Why run
at all? I think we ought to stay.

01:59:43.667 --> 01:59:46.667
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?

01:59:46.667 --> 01:59:49.625
And he'll come alone.

01:59:49.667 --> 01:59:52.167
I count three knives to
one. You think we could?

01:59:52.167 --> 01:59:54.667
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.

01:59:54.667 --> 01:59:56.708
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.

01:59:56.750 --> 02:00:00.708
Don't stop her. You don't
think I'm gonna let this happen.

02:00:00.750 --> 02:00:04.667
If you tell, there'll be a rash of
executions, and you don't want that.

02:00:04.667 --> 02:00:06.792
No, you don't want to lose
one of us, not even me.

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.750
You're clever, but I
wonder if you're right.

02:00:09.792 --> 02:00:13.667
Warn him, it's the end of us. You
warn him not, it's the end of him.

02:00:13.708 --> 02:00:17.667
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.

02:00:17.708 --> 02:00:20.167
No, Geoffrey's right.

02:00:20.208 --> 02:00:22.917
You're not an assassin.

02:00:22.958 --> 02:00:25.625
Look again.
Richard.

02:00:25.667 --> 02:00:28.875
Spare me that. You brought these
things. You want him dead? You do it.

02:00:28.875 --> 02:00:31.833
You unnatural animal.

02:00:31.875 --> 02:00:34.833
Unnatural, mummy? You tell
me, what's nature's way?

02:00:34.875 --> 02:00:38.667
If poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs,

02:00:38.708 --> 02:00:40.625
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad...

02:00:40.667 --> 02:00:43.792
and wives kill husbands,
what's unnatural?

02:00:43.833 --> 02:00:46.833
Come, here stands your lamb. Come
cover him in kisses. He's all yours.

02:00:47.583 --> 02:00:52.542
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.

02:00:52.583 --> 02:00:55.583
Where do you think I learned this
from? Who do you think I studied under?

02:00:55.625 --> 02:00:58.542
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.

02:00:58.583 --> 02:01:02.542
How many battles did I watch? But those
were battles, not a knife behind a door.

02:01:02.583 --> 02:01:05.917
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?

02:01:06.583 --> 02:01:08.917
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?

02:01:08.958 --> 02:01:11.542
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.

02:01:11.583 --> 02:01:15.583
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!

02:01:15.625 --> 02:01:18.958
I wanted Henry back.

02:01:20.958 --> 02:01:22.958
Liar!

02:01:24.583 --> 02:01:28.000
I wanted Henry.

02:01:28.583 --> 02:01:32.000
Don't trust her. She'll
warn him if she gets a chance.

02:01:36.583 --> 02:01:41.042
Dear, dear, whatever
shall we do with mother?

02:02:18.625 --> 02:02:21.125
It wants light.

02:02:26.125 --> 02:02:31.125
What we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day.

02:02:33.542 --> 02:02:35.500
I stole the candles
from the chapel.

02:02:35.542 --> 02:02:40.542
Jesus won't begrudge them,
and the chaplain works for me.

02:02:40.583 --> 02:02:44.083
You look dreadful.
So do you.

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:48.125
I underslept a little.

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:53.458
We can all rest
in a little while.

02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:02.167
There, that's better.

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:06.458
Bright and clear,
just like the morning.

02:03:07.208 --> 02:03:09.458
Fine looking boy.

02:03:13.208 --> 02:03:16.458
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:20.458
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?

02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:23.750
You were the best.

02:03:23.792 --> 02:03:26.292
I told her so.

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.458
You, I loved.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:31.458
You're going to keep us here.

02:03:32.292 --> 02:03:36.333
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.

02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:38.292
I'll never stop.

02:03:39.333 --> 02:03:41.500
I can't stop either.

02:04:11.792 --> 02:04:13.417
Brave boys...

02:04:14.417 --> 02:04:16.417
that's what I have.

02:04:22.958 --> 02:04:25.417
Come for me.

02:04:48.375 --> 02:04:51.375
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?

02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:53.333
But you're Henry.

02:04:53.375 --> 02:04:58.375
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?

02:04:58.417 --> 02:05:00.375
Again?
We always have before.

02:05:00.917 --> 02:05:05.375
Oh, yes,
we always have.

02:05:10.417 --> 02:05:13.375
Go on!

02:05:22.458 --> 02:05:24.417
Execute him.

02:05:27.375 --> 02:05:29.417
They're assassins,
aren't they?

02:05:30.458 --> 02:05:33.458
This was treason, wasn't it?

02:05:34.375 --> 02:05:39.375
You gave them life.
You take it.

02:05:46.292 --> 02:05:50.458
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.

02:05:58.333 --> 02:06:00.500
Therefore, I, Henry,
by the grace of God,

02:06:01.333 --> 02:06:05.292
king of the english, lord of
scotland, ireland and wales,

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:08.292
count of anjou, brittany,
poutou and normandy,

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:10.542
maine,
gascony and Aquitaine,

02:06:12.333 --> 02:06:15.292
do sentence you to death.

02:06:15.333 --> 02:06:19.542
Done this Christmas day
in chinon in God's year 1183.

02:07:06.667 --> 02:07:09.250
Surely that's not
what I intended.

02:07:12.708 --> 02:07:14.667
Children.

02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:18.250
Children.

02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:24.250
They're all we have.

02:07:27.250 --> 02:07:29.250
Go on.

02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:32.750
I'm done.

02:07:35.250 --> 02:07:37.250
I'm finished with you.

02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:40.792
You and I are finished.

02:08:08.792 --> 02:08:13.208
You spare the rod,
you'll spoil those boys.

02:08:19.208 --> 02:08:21.875
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.

02:08:23.875 --> 02:08:26.208
Nobody thought you could.

02:08:33.917 --> 02:08:35.917
Come rest.

02:08:36.917 --> 02:08:41.917
I want no women in
my life. You're tired.

02:08:42.208 --> 02:08:45.875
I could have conquered europe,
all of it,

02:08:45.917 --> 02:08:48.125
but I had women in my life.

02:08:50.125 --> 02:08:52.917
Go on, get out.
Go on.

02:09:01.958 --> 02:09:05.917
I should have
killed you years ago.

02:09:06.167 --> 02:09:09.958
You put me here. You made me
do mad things. You've bled me.

02:09:10.167 --> 02:09:13.083
Shoulder it yourself.

02:09:13.083 --> 02:09:16.000
Don't put it on my back.

02:09:16.167 --> 02:09:19.125
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.167
My losses are my work.

02:09:23.167 --> 02:09:25.125
What losses?

02:09:25.167 --> 02:09:28.000
I'm the one with nothing.

02:09:28.167 --> 02:09:31.042
Lost your life's work,
have you?

02:09:32.167 --> 02:09:35.167
Provinces are nothing.

02:09:35.167 --> 02:09:38.125
Land is dirt.

02:09:38.167 --> 02:09:44.083
I could take defeats like
yours and laugh. I've done it.

02:09:44.125 --> 02:09:47.125
If you're broken,
it's because you're brittle.

02:09:49.167 --> 02:09:52.125
I've lost.

02:09:52.167 --> 02:09:55.125
You won.

02:09:55.167 --> 02:09:59.125
And I can't ever
have you back again.

02:10:01.167 --> 02:10:05.167
You're all
that I have ever loved.

02:10:07.167 --> 02:10:11.167
Christ, you don't know
what nothing is.

02:10:12.167 --> 02:10:15.167
I want to die.
No, you don't.

02:10:15.208 --> 02:10:18.667
I want to die.
I'll hold you.

02:10:18.708 --> 02:10:21.917
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.

02:10:21.958 --> 02:10:25.167
I want to die.
Let me hold you.

02:10:25.208 --> 02:10:27.167
I want to die.

02:10:28.167 --> 02:10:31.125
You will, you know,
someday.

02:10:31.167 --> 02:10:33.167
Just wait long enough,
and it'll happen.

02:10:38.167 --> 02:10:40.167
So it will.

02:10:45.083 --> 02:10:49.083
We're in the cellar,
you're going back to prison,

02:10:49.125 --> 02:10:54.083
my life is wasted,
we've lost each other,

02:10:54.125 --> 02:10:56.083
and you're smiling.

02:10:58.083 --> 02:11:01.083
It's the way
I register despair.

02:11:05.083 --> 02:11:08.083
There's everything in life
but hope.

02:11:11.083 --> 02:11:13.083
We're both alive.

02:11:15.083 --> 02:11:18.083
And for all I know,
that's what hope is.

02:11:26.125 --> 02:11:29.083
We're jungle creatures,
Henry,

02:11:31.125 --> 02:11:35.083
and the dark
is all around us.

02:11:37.125 --> 02:11:41.125
See them...
in the corners?

02:11:41.125 --> 02:11:44.042
You can see the eyes.

02:11:52.042 --> 02:11:54.042
And they can see ours.

02:12:04.042 --> 02:12:06.042
I'm a match for anything.

02:12:08.042 --> 02:12:10.000
Aren't you?

02:12:10.042 --> 02:12:14.042
I should have been
a great fool...

02:12:14.083 --> 02:12:16.042
not to love you.

02:12:34.042 --> 02:12:36.000
You'll let me out
for easter?

02:12:36.042 --> 02:12:40.042
Come the resurrection,
you can strike me down again.

02:12:40.083 --> 02:12:42.042
Perhaps next time
I'll do it.

02:12:42.083 --> 02:12:45.000
And perhaps you won't.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
You know,
I hope we never die!

02:12:58.042 --> 02:12:59.958
So do I.

02:13:00.208 --> 02:13:03.000
You think there's
any chance of it?
